<p>The goal of this project was to write nine woodwind pieces in nine distinct scales.</p>



<h5 id="1-whole-tone-scale">1 &#8211; Whole tone scale</h5>



<p>This scale appealed to me as mysterious and incomplete, which is why I abruptly ended this melody. Because the flute gives a light, airy, bright, and rich sound that matches this song, I used it in the middle register.</p>

<h5 id="2-whole-tone-scale">2 &#8211; Whole-tone scale</h5>



<p>This is another melody I&#8217;ve kept incomplete because I get the feeling of doubt when hearing the whole-tone scale. I picked up the alto saxophone for this exercise mostly out of curiosity. If used softly in the lower register, it can transmit a melancholic sound, but when played faster and in the upper register, it can sound hard and clear.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="363" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-1024x363.png" alt="" class="wp-image-298" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-1024x363.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-300x106.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-768x272.png 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-1536x544.png 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-2048x725.png 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-640x227.png 640w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-960x340.png 960w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="3-east-european-major-scale">3 &#8211; East European major scale</h5>



<p>With significant leaps (3 semitones) between the 2nd and 3rd, and the 6th and 7th, this scale in major sounds quite celebratory. The bassoon, especially with the staccato, is perfectly suited for humorous sound. That&#8217;s why I tried to include it into the melody&#8217;s opening section.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="356" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1024x356.png" alt="" class="wp-image-301" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1024x356.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-300x104.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-768x267.png 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1536x534.png 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-2048x711.png 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-640x222.png 640w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-960x333.png 960w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2.png 2116w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7-2.mp3"></audio></figure>



<h5 id="4-east-european-minor-scale">4 &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">East European minor scale</h5>



<p>This scale, on the other hand, has a sorrowful and melancholy tone to it. I avoided choosing instruments that could communicate grief, such as the clarinet, and instead focused on the flute&#8217;s middle and low registers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="370" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-1024x370.png" alt="" class="wp-image-304" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-1024x370.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-300x108.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-768x278.png 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-1536x555.png 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-2048x741.png 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-640x231.png 640w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-960x347.png 960w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002.png 2077w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="5-middle-eastern-eight-note-scale">5 &#8211; Middle Eastern eight-note scale</h5>



<p>Due to the presence of numerous semitones, this scale sounded quite mysterious. Because of its dark timbre, I chose the contrabassoon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="207" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-1024x207.png" alt="" class="wp-image-306" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-1024x207.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-300x61.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-768x155.png 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-1536x310.png 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-2048x414.png 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-640x129.png 640w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-960x194.png 960w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006.png 2147w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7-7.mp3"></audio></figure>



<h5 id="6-middle-eastern-eight-note-scale">6 &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">Middle Eastern eight-note scale</h5>



<p>This song maintains the mystery nature of the scale, but I attempted to give it a more Middle Eastern flavor. In its middle range, the oboe was ideal for what I was seeking for.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="203" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-1024x203.png" alt="" class="wp-image-308" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-1024x203.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-300x60.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-768x152.png 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-1536x305.png 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-2048x406.png 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-640x127.png 640w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-960x191.png 960w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003.png 2101w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="7-nine-note-scale">7 &#8211; Nine-note scale</h5>



<p>The extra notes in this scale were used to create ornaments that are perfect for the piccolo. I ended up writing a pretty cheerful melody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="381" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-1024x381.png" alt="" class="wp-image-310" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-1024x381.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-300x111.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-768x285.png 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-1536x571.png 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-2048x761.png 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-640x238.png 640w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-960x357.png 960w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007.png 2123w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7-8.mp3"></audio></figure>



<h5 id="8-nine-note-scale">8 &#8211; Nine-note scale</h5>



<p>The extra notes also were used as ornaments for the clarinet&#8217;s fast sections in this melody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="377" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-1024x377.png" alt="" class="wp-image-312" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-1024x377.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-300x111.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-768x283.png 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-1536x566.png 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-2048x755.png 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-640x236.png 640w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-960x354.png 960w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008.png 2084w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h5 id="9-chromatic-scale">9 &#8211; Chromatic scale</h5>



<p>Among all the scales I wrote, this one was probably the most fun, since I got to play with the rising and descending of the scale in the first part and then utilize it to show off the lower register of the clarinet in the second part.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To compose melodies for woodwind instruments (Project 7), I first researched what types of instruments exist in the woodwind family, how to write for them, and what techniques they can achieve.</p>



<p>I found Samuel Adler&#8217;s book The Study of Orchestration to be an excellent resource for learning about orchestral instruments.</p>



<h2 id="classification" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1630378076466 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Classification</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Woodwind instruments are classified according to their families, reed type, pipe shape, intervals, and transposition (Adler, 2002). Classifying by family, in my opinion, makes more sense:</p>



<ol class="is-style-default"><li>The flute family &#8211; picollo, flute, alto flute, bass flute. The recorder is omitted since is not used in modern symphony orchestra (Adler, 2002).</li><li>The oboe family &#8211; oboe, oboe d&#8217;amour, English horn, hecklephone, bassoon, contrabassoon</li><li>The clarinet family &#8211; C, D, Eb, Bb, and A clarinets, alto clarinet (Eb), bass clarinet (generally in Bb, sometimes in Eb), contrabass clarinet (Bb or Eb), basset horn (F)</li><li>The saxophone family &#8211; sopranino (usually in Eb), soprano (Bb), alto (Eb), tenor (Bb), baritone (Eb), and bass saxophone (Bb) </li></ol>



<h2 id="transposition" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1630378089007 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Transposition</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>A transposing instrument generates pitches that aren&#8217;t the same as what&#8217;s on the page. <a href="http://www.orchestralibrary.com/reftables/rang.html#woodwinds" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.orchestralibrary.com/reftables/rang.html#woodwinds" target="_blank">This reference table, which I found on the website orchestralibrary.com</a>, is quite valuable because it includes not only the instrument range but also their transpositions.</p>



<p>The fundamental rule for all transposing instruments is that the written C will sound the instrument&#8217;s designated pitch. (2002, Adler)</p>



<h2 id="techniques" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1630379582051 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Techniques</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Woodwinds may generate a variety of techniques, and while it varies per instrument, most techniques are more difficult to manage in extreme registers than in middle registers (Adler, 2002).</p>



<h5 id="vibrato">Vibrato</h5>



<p>By default, the player can choose when to use vibrato, and the composer needs only to indicate <em>senza vibrato</em> or <em>non vibrato</em> if he does not want vibrato to be performed.</p>



<h5 id="tonguing-and-phrasing">Tonguing and phrasing</h5>



<p>A woodwind instrument&#8217;s articulations are affected by tonguing with a tuh-like or a duh-like sound. Unless there is a slur, notes are articulated separately and tongued. If there are slurs, notes are played in one breath with tongue only used on the first note. It is called legato.</p>



<h5 id="staccato">Staccato</h5>



<p>A dot above or below the note will produce a very short note with a natural separation between notes.</p>



<h5 id="soft-tonguing">Soft tonguing</h5>



<p>Soft tonguing is represented by slurs written in notes with dots or slashes. It has the same impact as slurred staccato.</p>



<h5 id="double-tonguing">Double tonguing</h5>



<p>In quick passages, double tonguing is used to produce a sound similar to te ke.</p>



<h5 id="dynamic-envelopes">Dynamic envelopes</h5>



<p>Moving from a strong attack to a lower volume and then back up to a higher level creates a powerful effect. Although woodwinds are not the only instruments that can achieve this effect, they are the greatest at it.</p>



<h5 id="flutter-tongue">Flutter tongue</h5>



<p>This effect creates a rolled <em>r</em> sound, which is common in woodwind instruments. Except for oboes and bassoons, it&#8217;s simple to play on most instruments. To create the optimum sound, the flutter tongue may require extended notes or complete passages. <em>Flutter tongue</em> or <em>flatterzunge</em> must be noted above the passage in the score.</p>



<h5 id="other-special-effects">Other special effects</h5>



<p>Multiphonics, when an instrument produces more than a note.</p>



<p>Glissandi, can be used in the upward direction, especially in clarinet and saxophone.</p>



<p>Slap tonguing produces a perky and snappy attack.</p>



<p>Key clicking, when the player slaps the notes without blowing air.</p>



<p>Whistle tones, when the player turns the instrument far from the face and blows across it.</p>



<p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[

		<span>Jacques Ibert ‚Äì Pi√®ce for flute alone</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>This work, written in 1936, was influenced by the movement started by&nbsp;Debussy&#8217;s Syrinx, to&nbsp;write&nbsp;for flute without accompaniment (Lee, 2018). Flute pieces were not very prevalent during the baroque era as solo instrument.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until the instrument&#8217;s development around the turn of the XX&nbsp;century that a large number of flute players emerged and began commissioning new works for the instrument. (Toff,&nbsp;2012). Pi√®ce for solo flute by Jaques Ibert was written for the French flautist Marcel Moyse.</p>

<p>This piece&#8217;s theme appeals to me much. It&#8217;s actually really simple. The supertonic and tonic dotted crochets are followed by six quavers, all in the Db scale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="168" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png" alt="" class="wp-image-267" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png 724w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-300x70.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-640x149.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p>I find this theme particularly appealing because these two notes work together like a sigh. The supertonic represents an inhale and the tonic represents a exhale. Since this piece was written in 1937, between the two great wars, I would say that its motif captures both the hope and disbelief of humanity. Are we going to be at war again? Perhaps not. Inhale. Or most likely, yes. Exhale. After these two notes, there is an answer to the question. Occasionally, they are optimistic and go up (bars 25 and 26), but they are usually pessimistic and go down.</p>



<p>There are 4 parts to this piece: Introduction &#8211; Part A &#8211; Part B &#8211; Part A&#8217;.</p>



<h2 id="introduction" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876025605 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Introduction</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The work begins with a gradual but increasing repetition of D, eventually developing to a quicker sequence of semiquavers and demisemiquavers. This introduction includes a rhythmic portion as well as a wide range of notes that demonstrate the flute&#8217;s tonal diversity. D4 to D6. It culminates in an ascension that leads to the main theme.</p>



<h2 id="part-a" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875870212 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The theme is presented and repeated to establish that this will be a recurring motif in all music and that the listener will remember it. Following that, Ibert interacts with the theme and cadence, frequently ending in surprising notes. It continues until bar 34, when it returns to the original theme but briefly switches to the Gb scale before returning to the D. The question (are we going to be at war?) is left unresolved at the end of this section.</p>



<h2 id="part-b" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876008964 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part B</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Part A is disrupted by this section. It momentarily switches to 9/8 time signature before switching to 3/4 &#8211; 2/4. There&#8217;s also a wave-like tune that conveys some anxiousness and unease. This is also sensed as we transition from a major to a minor scale. It&#8217;s the song&#8217;s most energizing section.</p>



<h2 id="part-a-2" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875998799 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A&#8217;</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>We return to the motif, but this time raised an octave. I believe that the composer needed to bring the listener back to the familiarity of the theme without losing the rush because we just came from such an exciting section. The melody then returns to its original octave, bringing us back home. We keep the sigh, just like we did at the start because the music provides no answers to the initial inquiry. Inhale, then exhale. And the piece ends in Db, which is a semitone below the composition&#8217;s starting note. The Db is repeated in the last bar, but two octaves lower. I don&#8217;t think it contributes anything to the finish and, in my opinion, should be omitted, just as Moyse did in the performance above.</p>



<p>When I started researching for this piece, I discovered that this is one of the most popular pieces among flute students. I&#8217;m beginning to see why. Ibert demonstrates the flute&#8217;s versatility throughout these 5 minutes of music, from trills to rapidly rising and falling scales, to the lovely two notes from the theme that, if performed effectively, can convey the optimism/pessimism duality that I believe the composer was attempting to portray.</p>

	</span>
</h2>



<p>Hovhaness was an Armenian-American composer who lived in the United States. Although I can&#8217;t discover a backstory for the Lament for Clarinet (1935), the Armenian exodus is a central motif in his Exile Symphony, which was written a year later (1936). (Athens, 2016). As a result, it&#8217;s plausible to assume that this sombre work was influenced by the Armenian situation in the United States and around the world.</p>

<p>This piece doesn&#8217;t appear to have a rigid structure, except for the main theme in bar 23 that is repeated with variations several times. There is also a motif featured at the beginning of the piece and repeated intermittently throughout.</p>



<p>The main theme consists of a fast rise from F to C, which is then sustained for nearly a full bar. Then there&#8217;s a quaver-crochet pattern that creates the impression that the character is walking or moving, but extremely slowly, as if dragging something, like a great pain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="211" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-1024x211.png" alt="" class="wp-image-276" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-1024x211.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-300x62.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-768x158.png 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-1536x317.png 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-640x132.png 640w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-960x198.png 960w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35.png 1640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The first notes, in my opinion, do an excellent job of portraying the composer&#8217;s grief. It reminds me of Sodade, a song by Cape Verdean singer Ces√°ria √âvora. It&#8217;s also a lament for her hometown, which she misses. The chorus&#8217;s initial two notes are a fast rise from G&nbsp;to C, akin to Hovaness&#8217; piece.</p>

<p>This informs me that the clarinet is excellent at resonating with the human voice, which I believe Hovaness was attempting to demonstrate in this piece. The clarinet sings a human grief.</p>



<p>This piece begins with a fast crescendo that demonstrates the clarinet&#8217;s vast range (F3 to C6). Everything slows down after this fast crescendo, with long sustained notes and a bend. I had no idea the clarinet could bend notes, which is fascinating to me. It has a lot of potentials to enhance mourning, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The composer then begins his exploration of the clarinet&#8217;s chalumeau register, with lower pitch notes, which, once again, is an excellent choice for passing the song&#8217;s sadness.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t figure out what scale the composer is using, although the majority of the notes picked sound exotic to me. I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s an Indian scale.</p>



<p>The theme is repeated four times, each time with slight modifications, but always ending on a lower pitch than when it began. It seems to be stating that no matter how hard the character tries to move up, it always ends up going down.</p>



<p>Then, with the reprise of the rising from the song&#8217;s beginning, there&#8217;s a ray of hope. A repetition of bars 19-21,  but again we return to a lower tone as if the character refuses to let go of his or her misery. Several times, hitting&nbsp;the same note, A.</p>



<p>We return to the main theme, always with the sadness of concluding on a lower tone than we began.</p>



<p>Here we begin a dialogue between hope and lament. Hope is a repetition of the preceding fast-rising, but this time it ascends to Db6, the highest note in all music. It&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s our character&#8217;s final hope, followed by a repeat of the first bar. Our character, on the other hand, gives up and plays the same notes for two bars.</p>



<p>Hopes responds by repeating the ascending to the highest tone. However, our character is slowly dying (the composer wrote the morendo in the score), with the semiquavers and crochets gradually fading to the low notes.</p>



<p>This composition struck me as very sad, and I believe that was the composer&#8217;s intention. Probably because of its history and all the stories he must have witnessed and experienced. Hovhaness was very familiar with the clarinet and its expressive possibilities (Wolverton, 2002), so it&#8217;s no surprise that this piece captures the melancholy and lament so beautifully.</p>



<p>As I previously stated, the clarinet has the ability to express human emotions, and when effectively crafted, it can feel as though there is a highly varied singer behind this instrument. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll remember this in my upcoming compositions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the composers with whom I most identify is Claude Debussy. So when I stumbled across this piece when researching pentatonic scale melodies, I knew I&#8217;d like it. I was not mistaken.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>My primary focus during this analysis will be on melody since that&#8217;s the component of the unit I&#8217;m studying.</p>



<p>This work, written by Claude Debussy between 1909 and 1910 for piano, was later transferred to a variety of other instruments.</p>



<p>The theme is introduced with a simple but lovely melodic line consisting entirely of Gb major pentatonic notes. I find this melody to be interesting because it ascends and descends in the pentatonic scale &#8212; in theory, that may sound boring, but it&#8217;s rather pleasing to listen to in this case.</p>



<p>The theme is then repeated, but instead of going up and down like the first time, we start descending the Gb scale in bar 10. This indicates that the music is going forward and not stuck in the same repetitive pattern, which should be uninteresting.</p>



<p>The work maintains its wave-like melody, but at bar 15, during one of the dramatic ascends, we switch to the Cb major pentatonic scale, reaching the highest note in the piece thus far. The melody then gradually descends in the Gb major scale, with the one quaver &#8211; two semiquavers that are so characteristic of this work, bringing familiarity and tranquillity to the music.</p>



<p>In bar 19, the score states &#8220;Un Peu Anim√©&#8221;, which I believe is the start of the song&#8217;s climax, where we ascend into three octaves in the scale of Eb Major and reach the highest note so far in the melody.</p>



<p>After the exhilaration of the finale, the primary theme returns, offering familiarity and security once more. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that this theme is a chord-based version of the familiar motif.</p>



<p>It all comes to a halt at bar 28 when the motif returns, but this time an octave higher. This gives the music a lot of tranquillity and a little dreaminess, in my opinion. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re reminiscing about how it all began. It&#8217;s also a little nostalgic.</p>



<p>In bar 33, we repeat bar 14, which brings us to the end of the song. The PP and minims make sure we reach a safe and stable conclusion.</p>



<p>Finally, I was drawn to this music since it is a singable melody that employs simple and common scales. This is the kind of melody I enjoy writing, and I&#8217;m hoping to get some inspiration from Debussy in Assignment 2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C. This song from the eighteenth century piqued my curiosity, so I decided to investigate it more.</p>



<p>The lyrics are as follows, in their literal translation:</p>



<p>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>Sweet-smelling, beautiful, stems full of buds<br>Fragrant and white, everyone praises<br>Let me pluck you down<br>Give to someone else<br>Jasmine flower, oh jasmine flower</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When I first read¬†this score, the slurs between two notes, going one tone up or down, gave it a very pleasant Chinese characteristic sound. It&#8217;s almost like a vocal slide that makes you feel either eager or peaceful depending on which direction you&#8217;re facing.</p>



<p>The song begins with a simple phrase that progresses from E to C, the song&#8217;s highest note, and then down to G. The song proceeds to a calmer section after the repetition of the first phrase, with mostly crochets and note repetition. It eventually descends to C, one octave lower than the highest C.</p>



<p>The last section is when the slur is used more frequently, most likely because the melody shifts from praising the jasmine blossom to taking it up and offering it to someone else. After ascending to the highest C, the song begins to descend to the lowest note, G. I believe the impression of falling down is achieved using this slurs going from E to lower G. It was strikingly beautiful to me.</p>



<p>I then went to Youtube to look for more versions of this song, and I came across this one by the Choir of St John&#8217;s College Cambridge, which I thought was the most fascinating arrangement.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project, which is part 2 of the program, is to compose three short contrasting melodies for vocals based on the pentatonic scale. To keep them engaging, it&#8217;s a good idea to be conscious of the dynamics, tempo, and rhythm.</p>

<p>I attempted to make things as simple as possible in my first exercise, concentrating mostly on the melody shape. It&#8217;s written in C, but I begin in E to add interest and to allow the melody to descend a little to lead the listener to the highest note in the melody.</p>

<p>I opted to develop an exercise with the F# pentatonic because it can be played on the piano&#8217;s black keys. It began to sound Chinese to me, so I went with it. It ended up having a straight melody shape, starting low, rising, going down, going higher, falling, going up a little and ending almost straight.</p>

<p>After hearing Debussy&#8217;s La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin, I was drawn to the main motif&#8217;s &#8220;wave&#8221; shape. I wanted to create a melody that resembled waves. I used the Bb pentatonic, but there&#8217;s a modulation to Eb in the middle, then back to Bb in the conclusion.</p>

<p>Finally, I believe that this effort helped me better comprehend the pentatonic scale&#8217;s possibilities and reinforce my knowledge of articulations from Taylor&#8217;s material.</p>

		<span>The universal language</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>I must confess that, aside from knowing what the pentatonic scale was, I had no idea how important it was in music. I used to think it was a simple scale that was mostly used in nursery rhymes and was used as the first scale a novice learns.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that I was not mistaken, after viewing this incredible video by musician Anuja Kamat, I realized that the pentatonic scale is used all over the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>But why is the pentatonic scale employed by ancient civilizations and people all across the world? Mathematics and frequency are the keys to the solution. Because all notes have a straightforward relationship between them, as illustrated in the points below, all notes sound good. As a result, they appeal to everyone&#8217;s ears.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>tonic has whatever frequency&nbsp;you first chose</li><li>supertonic has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1‚Öõ</li><li>mediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1¬º</li><li>dominant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1¬Ω</li><li>submediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1‚Öî</li><li>tonic (octave above) has the frequency of orginal tonic&nbsp;multiplied by 2</li></ul>



<p>The pentatonic scale appears in a variety of musical styles, which is fascinating. In the Chinese folk tune Mo Li Hua, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In the well-known Amazing Grace, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="96" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-300x28.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-768x72.png 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-640x60.png 640w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-960x90.png 960w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image.png 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Hold On We&#8217;re Going Home by Drake is another song that uses the pentatonic scale, which is quite prevalent in pop music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="79" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-300x23.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-768x59.png 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1536x119.png 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-2048x159.png 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-640x50.png 640w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-960x74.png 960w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1.png 2066w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It is also employed by classical composers. Debussy&#8217;s La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin contains another melody based on the pentatonic scale (except for an F).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.teoria.com/res/images/articles/debussy-fille-aux-cheveux-des-lin/tema.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>It makes me wonder whether maybe the pentatonic scale is the so-coveted universal language. A common language shared by people from various places, cultures, and eras. Even if two persons from completely different cultures and musical backgrounds are brought together, they may agree that these five notes sound good. </p>



<p>This Bob McFerrin story exemplifies it perfectly.</p>

<p>Although I still believe the pentatonic scale is a simple scale, I now recognize its significance in music and the vast possibilities it offers. I&#8217;m going to use them in the pentatonic scale melody project I&#8217;m working on.</p>

		<span>I started this course two months ago and already feel like I&#8217;ve come a long way.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Prior to this, I had never written music in notation, had no experience with Sibelius, and my only understanding of percussion instruments was limited to those found in a rock drum kit.</p>



<p>During these two months, I read various books and watched videos to better grasp how to notate music, how to listen to music, and how different instruments sound. Among my sources are:</p>

		<span>About Assignment 1</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Following the finishing of the composition, I&#8217;m quite satisfied with the outcome, despite the fact that it took me longer than I anticipated. But I have to admit that making a plan ahead of time helped me stay focused and save time. This is an important lesson to remember for future projects.</p>



<p>As with all challenges, there were some parts that were easier than others.</p>



<p>Because of my professional background, I found the narrative section to be the most straightforward to write, therefore it was the first thing I did. Another thing that came naturally to me was writing themes depending on the story I wanted to tell.</p>



<p>Working with unpitched instruments was the most difficult part for me, and I often felt like I needed a pitched instrument to make a melody. Along the way, I discovered that employing various sounding percussion instruments might help in the creation of a melody. That&#8217;s what I sought to achieve with my composition.</p>



<p>Another challenge I faced was figuring out how to use the rests. Mostly, because most percussion instruments have such a short decay that the note&#8217;s duration is irrelevant and should be stated in an easy-to-read notation (Blatter and Blatter, 1997). I tried to make it simple for the players to read the rests by using the strong beat.</p>



<p>Overall, my ability to construct a 2-minute composition exceeded my expectations. The use of the variable meter has especially&nbsp;impressed me. I found it really beneficial in transmitting the devils&#8217; sense of disorder, and I ended up using it a lot more than I expected. On the other side, I believe I could do a better job of not using too many notes, or complicating things too much.</p>



<p>The key takeaway from this composition is that creating music in notation allows me to think more slowly about each section of the song and to delve deeper into each particular instrument.</p>



<p>As I previously stated, this was my first time using just percussion and non-pitched instruments, and my aim is that it will provide me with the foundations to write with a variety of instruments, specially tuned ones.</p>

		<span>Assignment 1: A composition¬†for a group of untuned percussion</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The first assignment&#8217;s brief is really exciting: to complete an unfinished ballet score called Wild Dance, of which only the first 14 bars have been completed and the sole indication is: Curtain rises &#8211; enter a group of demons. The goal is to create a complete composition with unpitched percussion that lasts between 2 and 3 minutes.</p>



<p>I looked deeper into the composition and made a few tweaks to the concept after<a href="/project-4-about-structure/" data-type="URL" data-id="/project-4-about-structure/" target="_blank"> the plan I developed in Project 4</a>. The most notable difference is in the narrative, which has an impact on the structure.</p>



<p>You can find the score <a href="https://bit.ly/pedroassignment1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://bit.ly/pedroassignment1" target="_blank">here</a> and listen to it below:</p>

<p>Do you know how you feel when you&#8217;re about to do something that makes you uncomfortable? Maybe the first time you kissed a person you loved? Or when you&#8217;re taking an exam that you haven&#8217;t prepared for? Or every time you perform in front of a large crowd?</p>



<p>A lot of things happen in your head: adrenaline rushes, you feel dizzy, and your mind is filled with conflicting thoughts. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; &#8220;What if everything goes wrong?&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m not prepared,&#8221; &#8220;I think I can do it!&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221;<br>Inside your head, it&#8217;s like a war between demons and angels.</p>



<p>This is the subject of this piece. Sometimes the angels prevail, and other times your anxieties triumph. Demons win in this one.</p>

<p>I constructed a structure for the piece using the &#8220;Wild Dance&#8221; as a starting point, with the form: A B C B&#8217; A&#8217;.</p>

<p><strong>Part A</strong> Bars 1 &#8211; 30</p>



<p>This section serves as an introduction, introducing the demons. I decided to keep the provided piece and extend it until the 30th Bar. The provided score begins with a motif that I utilized to introduce the demons. I used the same instruments as the demons: cymbals, tambourine, snare, and bass drum.</p>

<p><strong>Part B </strong>Bars 31 &#8211; 77</p>



<p>Here we have the attack of the demons. Although the tempo is the same, the intensity is bigger with the snare having more prominence than in the introduction, giving the feeling of a faster section. I kept the variable meter from the introduction, as it passes the sense of nervousness. </p>



<p>I thought of an attack motif as an inversion of the time signature of the introduction, 3/8 &#8211; 5/8 instead of 5/8 &#8211; 3/8, to give some familiarity while maintaining the 3 2 3. This motif ends with a small pause since I want to give the listener the feeling of hesitation. </p>

<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled has-regular-font-size"><li>Bar 31 the Part B starts with a wink to Part A, with the crescendo working as the launch of the attack. I repeat it several times to work as the launch of each attack. </li><li>Bars 32-41 the snare establishes the motif. </li><li>Bars 42-46 are the repetition of bars 31-35 with some modifications.</li><li>Bars 47-57 the tambourine substitutes the snare and derives from the motif.</li><li>Bars 58-67 the motif continues and the cymbal strikes more often, reaching the climax.</li><li>Bars 68-71 the first part of the motif is repeated to reach the climax and end the Part B</li><li>Bars 72-77 the ritardando is used to transmit the demons&#8217; tiredness and build a bridge to Part C, with the Tam-Tam and Bass Drum (Bar 76) ending it.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Part C</strong> Bars 78 &#8211; 98</p>



<p>Part C is devoted to the angels. This section contrasts with the previous ones by being slower and with fewer instrument strikes. I want the listener to breathe from the previous strikes and to prepare for the following ones. For the angels&#8217; instruments, I picked Finger Cymbals &#8211; Cabasa &#8211; Bongos &#8211; Bass Drum. The motif came after I watched the tremolo Finger Cymbal technique in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt6nyCLf45s" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt6nyCLf45s" target="_blank">this Zildjian video</a>. I liked how spacial it sounded. Then I thought that the cabasa would be a good fit for the Finger Cymbals, so I researched some playing techniques and ended up finding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAwVq2VbBbc" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAwVq2VbBbc" target="_blank">this video</a> showing the player hitting the cabasa and shaking it, which sounded perfect for me. The Bass drum provides the base rhythm and the Bongos provide the dance rhythm.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10.png" alt="" class="wp-image-199" width="253" height="298" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10.png 740w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10-254x300.png 254w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10-300x354.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10-640x756.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" /></figure>



<p>The time signature is always 5/8 &#8211; 5/8 &#8211; 6/8 to keep it simple and predictable.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 78-80 establishes the motif, ending in a kind of delay sound for the cabasa.</li><li>Bars 81-94 are the repetition of the motif but with the bongos providing the danceable rhythm.</li><li>Bars 95-98 the repetition and the acceleration of the snare brings us a new attack, to the B&#8217; part.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Part B&#8217;</strong> Bars 99 &#8211; 120</p>



<p>This reprise is a shortened version of Part B, where the motif is repeated at first, but then the tambourine joins the snare in a new pattern to gain force in this last attack. In the end, they defeat the angels.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 99-103 are the repetition of the 32-35 bars.</li><li>Bars 104-116 we can hear the last attack, the tambourine joins the snare and the cymbal joins the bass drum. All instruments grow in presence.</li><li>Bars 117-120 are a passage to the closing. The claves enter to make a celebratory dance, very childish and naive, but very simple. Only later I noticed it sounds like the intro of Rage Against The Machine&#8217;s Killing In The Name.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Part C&#8217;</strong> Bars 121 &#8211; 136</p>



<p>The dance ends as it started, but is slower. Since the demons won, they don&#8217;t need to make all the rush they did at the beginning, but can make a slow and confident victory dance. Ending with the same motif from the beginning makes a full circle, meaning that like the demons in your head, they always come and go, and this is not an isolated battle.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 121-128 are the repetition of bars 3-10, with the little addition of bass drum to add more base sound, because of the slower tempo.</li><li>Bars 129-130 the repetition continues but with the increase of the cymbal and snare.</li><li>Bars 131-136 the cymbal has a little motif of 5 consecutive strokes with all the other instruments increasing in strokes until the end.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The goal of this final project, which comes before the first assignment, is to create a plan for the assignment composition, which should last between 2 and 3 minutes and begin with the specified composition.</p>



<p>One thing I noticed is that it is suggested that the plan begins with the structure before deciding on the content. However, when I look at Assignment 1, I find that it begins with a group of demons entering the scene. As a result, I&#8217;m reluctant to separate the idea from the structure. So I decided to start with the idea/story and then go on to the structure.</p>



<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>



<p>When I first read &#8220;Curtain Rises, enter a group of demons&#8221; at the start of assignment 1, I immediately thought of the devils that pop into your head from time to time. Particularly when you&#8217;re going to do something that makes you feel uneasy. For example, for me, it was when I began writing music in notation, which I had never done before. All of your demons begin to rush through your head in the form of doubts such as &#8220;will I be able to do this?&#8221; and &#8220;why did I even start this course?&#8221;</p>



<p>For this piece, I decided to explore the battle between spirits (doubts, anxieties, self-censorship) and demons (confidence, tranquillity, wisdom) that happen inside your head when you&#8217;re about to do something uncomfortable.</p>



<h2 id="the-structure">The Structure</h2>



<p>Starting with the given Wild Dance composition, I opted to utilize the specified tempo (153 bpm) as the demons tempo since it conveys a sense of haste and chaos. By contrast, the angels will move at a slower pace, conveying a sense of tranquillity. </p>



<p>As I previously stated, my composition will be about a clash&nbsp;in which demons arrive and attack, angels defend, demons counter-attack and the angels ultimately triumph. I want the audience to sense this conflict, which will be reflected in the speed and instrument shifts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular cnvs-block-core-table-1628498574118"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A &#8211; A horde of demons appear on stage, dancing around the angels and provoking them. The angels are standing calmly nearby.</td><td>Principal</td><td>~30 seconds at 153 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>B &#8211; The demons strike with hesitation, insecurity, and anxiety.</td><td>Principal</td><td>~40 seconds at 153 bpm</td></tr><tr><td>C- The angels continue to live in peace. They are composed, self-assured, and wise. They don&#8217;t desire war, so they demonstrate this by dancing slowly and peacefully.</td><td>Subsidiary</td><td>~40 seconds at 85 bpm</td></tr><tr><td>B&#8217;-The demons retaliate, but they&#8217;re growing nervous.</td><td>Reprise</td><td>~20 seconds at 153 bpm</td></tr><tr><td>C&#8217;-The angels grow in strength and distance themselves from the demons.</td><td>Closing</td><td>~20 seconds at 153 bpm</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="the-motifs">The motifs</h2>



<p>I developed some themes for each section. The first one will serve as an introduction and the example is already delivered, which heavily uses the tambourine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39.png" alt="" class="wp-image-188" width="270" height="336" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39.png 500w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39-241x300.png 241w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39-300x373.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /></figure>



<p>In the B section, I imagined the demons&#8217; strike to be powerful, but with a slight hesitation at the end.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31.png" alt="" class="wp-image-189" width="277" height="346" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31.png 508w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31-240x300.png 240w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31-300x374.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></figure>



<p>The angels in the C portion are calm, assertive, and peaceful. It will contrast with the prior two motifs&#8217; warlike snare.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45.png" alt="" class="wp-image-190" width="281" height="323" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45.png 514w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45-261x300.png 261w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45-300x344.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /></figure>



<h2 id="the-instruments">The instruments</h2>



<p>For the demons parts, I chose the given instruments (Bass Drum, Snare Drum, Tambourine, Cymbal) because I believe they convey the sense of urgency and aggression I want to portray. In addition to the Bass Drum, a rhythmic instrument, the angels will also use the Bongos, Cabasa, and Finger Cymbals.</p>



<p>For simplicity, I retained four instruments for each part, and since I want it to be played by four musicians, they only have to switch between two instruments.</p>
