<p>The global success of Rosalía’s new album, Lux, made it impossible for me to ignore, so I finally sat down to listen. In my view, the record is a triumph because it is a conceptual work where a mainstream artist takes the liberty to create something entirely different from the formatted pop we hear today. Among the tracks, <em>Memória</em> stood out most. Partly because I am Portuguese and I adore Carminho, but also because of how it bridges two worlds.</p>



<p>To me, <em>Memória</em> captures a deep sense of saudade through its inherent sadness. The dramatic contrast between the quiet instruments and the intense, longing delivery of the lyrics creates a mood of profound introspection. It feels like a bridge between the past and the present, where the minimalist production allows the emotional weight of the Fado tradition to shine without being over-produced. I found the experience deeply moving, as it proves that mainstream music can still be surprising.</p>



<p>I adore how the minimalist texture, featuring a delicate interplay between harp and piano, replaces the traditional Portuguese guitar, pushing the sound toward an ethereal, dreamlike atmosphere rather than a standard folk style.</p>

<p>This piece combines chamber orchestra, narrator, and voice in a way that clearly separates their roles. The orchestra provides the main emotional and structural foundation, using long, sustained lines and gentle dynamics that reflect the idea of a lullaby. These musical features create a calm and continuous background rather than strong contrasts or dramatic development.</p>



<p>The narrator delivers the text in a clear and direct manner, which allows the meaning of the words to remain understandable. The solo voice adds another layer, using simple melodic material that blends with the orchestral texture instead of standing out too strongly.</p>



<p>This work moved me, particularly the contrast between the innocence of a &#8220;lullaby&#8221; and the brutal reality of the siege. The dramatic contrast between the narrator&#8217;s steady voice and the soaring, mournful soprano at the end felt like a deep experience, reflecting both deep despair and a glimmer of hope. It reinforces my belief that including a narrator can transform a musical performance into a personal, cinematic journey.</p>

<p>Listening to this was a different experience from most string quartet music I know. What interested me most was how the spoken text and the music exist together without competing. The narration does not tell a story in a dramatic way. Instead, it feels like quiet thoughts placed inside the music. This made me listen more carefully to both elements.</p>



<p>I found that the music creates a space for reflection rather than strong emotions. The rhythmic patterns and repeated ideas reminded me of everyday movement and energy, especially in modern life. At the same time, the spoken words felt personal and honest. Because the text is spoken, not sung, I could understand it easily, and it felt more direct and human.</p>



<p>I also liked that the piece changes depending on where it is performed and who writes the text. This made me think about music as something connected to people and place. Overall, the piece made me reflect on how music can support thinking and listening, rather than leading the listener too strongly. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When this unit began, I knew I wanted to pursue a collaboration that aligned with my growing interest in music education for young people. Having spent my career as a copywriter, I&#8217;ve recently discovered through this degree that I genuinely enjoy orchestration and composition, but I&#8217;ve never had a piece performed live. The possibility of working with John (Choral Director) and Elena (String Program Director) at an international school in Portugal offered both: a chance to explore collaborative creation with experienced music educators and the prospect of hearing my first composition come to life in performance.</p>



<p>The project centred on creating a new musical setting for the beloved Portuguese poem, &#8220;Eu tive um sonho, sonhei a paz,&#8221;. This poem had only ever been associated with the melody of ABBA&#8217;s &#8220;I Have a Dream,&#8221; and I wanted to liberate this beautiful text by giving it the original music it deserved.</p>



<p>The initial scoping phase was a genuinely exciting introduction to two new creative minds. My role was quickly defined by the partners&#8217; context: composing, orchestrating, and documenting. Their roles were to function as consultants, applying the pragmatic lens of the school environment (student ability, instrument availability, and time constraints) to my creative vision. </p>



<p>The whole process required us to be very flexible. I started by drafting a piano/vocal score in C Major, but a key feedback session immediately led to several detailed revisions. The first one was the need to transpose the piece to A Major for both comfortable vocal range and easier string dexterity. For the conductor&#8217;s score, the choral parts were condensed into two staves (Soprano/Alto and Tenor/Bass) to make it cleaner and easier to read. The String Director also marked the violin solo clearly with the standard &#8220;solo&#8221; and &#8220;tutti&#8221; markings and designated the beginner-level Orchestra 1 parts (obbligato viola, cello, and bass) to alternate between pizzicato and arco on the simplest harmonic notes.</p>



<p>While I valued the practical refinement that came from this expertise, a key area for reflection emerged here. At times, the process felt more like a commission, where my work was immediately accepted, and the directors focused on refining the delivery methods rather than challenging or pushing the creative core of the composition itself. I found myself wishing for a more reciprocal, creatively challenging partnership, where the directors might offer alternative melodic or rhythmic ideas. Moving forward, I need to learn how to explicitly solicit this deeper level of joint creative input, moving the partnership closer to a truly equal collaboration.</p>



<p>The final stage involved incorporating all the technical feedback into the finished score and parts. This included all the detailed adjustments: John&#8217;s structural suggestions, and the inclusion of the vocal line in the piano accompaniment for singer support. The final deliverables were then handed over to the music department for rehearsal.</p>



<p>The total duration of focused collaboration remained around four hours, yet the density of the feedback proved productive, integrating my orchestration knowledge with the practical realities of a high school ensemble. This stage also marked the end of the direct creative partnership for this test project. While the piece now rests in their hands and I await the premiere with great anticipation, the academic focus on the collaboration is now complete.</p>



<p>This test project was a valuable experience. It integrated my passion for music education and composition with my professional background, producing a work that will soon achieve its first performance. The most critical learning point is the need to navigate the balance between a successful consultative partnership, where technical delivery is streamlined and effective, and a truly reciprocal collaboration, which demands greater creative inputs and shared risk-taking from all parties.</p>



<p>The success of the technical handover gives me great confidence in moving forward with the larger, longer-term &#8220;Portuguese Explorers&#8221; project. I now understand the necessity of formalising the initial stages with a Pre-Score Constraints Checklist and establishing a Co-written Brief to track the shared creative journey and ensure both accountability and deeper collective input in the future.</p>

<p>Impression I was completely unfamiliar with this piece before this listening, so I had no expectations. Listening to the recording by The Sixteen, I was immediately surprised by the complexity of the melody. It felt distinctively different from the straightforward, folk-like structure of traditional carols.</p>



<p>The defining characteristic of this piece is the extensive use of melisma. It uses these flowing, intricate lines to create a fluid sense of motion. I noticed that the meter (time signature) feels very flexible, avoiding a rigid beat. This rhythmic freedom, combined with the rolling melismas, created a sensation that I interpreted as gentle waves. It feels as though the music is physically rocking the listener.</p>



<p>The music flows organically from start to finish. The final cadence was breathtaking to me; it settles into a peaceful resolution that feels ethereal. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Although Christmas carols have been present through all my life, I realised that I rarely listen to them with a critical ear. Usually, they are just background atmosphere for the holiday season. Listening to this specific recording by St. George&#8217;s Chapel Choir forced me to stop and observe why I have always enjoyed this piece, moving beyond simple nostalgia to a deeper musical understanding.</p>



<p>Structurally, the piece is built on contrast and accumulation. I liked the relationship between the different voice parts: while the harmonic progression in the bass line is often downward/descending, the melody in the upper registers continues to rise. This contrary motion creates a high level of musical tension.</p>



<p>The dynamic range is what creates the drama. The song transforms from a quiet, almost secretive opening into a massive wall of sound. There is a rapid and intense crescendo that builds until the choir reaches a climax. At this peak, it feels as if the music explodes into a mesh of voices. This sudden shift evokes a sense of breathless excitement, like a flurry of snow or ringing bells.</p>

<p>I listened to the Royal Choral Society&#8217;s performance of this piece. It is such a beautiful example a choral sound. It&#8217;s very polite, restrained, but deeply emotional. I have been discovering that Holst has a specific way of writing melodies that feels very human and grounded.</p>



<p>The melody is the most striking element. The melody moves mostly in stepwise. The melody starts by ascending gently, reaching a hopeful peak (perhaps symbolizing heaven), but ultimately descends back down to the tonic note, finding a resting place (symbolizing earth). This creates a sense of resignation and humility. The harmony is diatonic and simple, avoiding complex chromatic chords, which matches the poem&#8217;s theme of poverty and simplicity.</p>



<p>The slow tempo establishes a somber but peaceful mood. It perfectly captures the image of a &#8220;bleak&#8221; winter landscape. It felt very intimate to me, despite being sung by a large choir.</p>
