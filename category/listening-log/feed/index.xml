<p>I felt this fugue was really lovely, especially because I enjoyed the theme and Bach used it frequently throughout this composition. In fact, I thought this fugue was quite theme-centric, with the theme inverted, augmented, and rhythmically varied. It&#8217;s also worth noting that this fugue goes from a straightforward exposition to a three-voiced narrative.</p>



<p>To be clear, some sources indicate that this fugue is in Eb minor; nevertheless, the prelude is in Eb minor, but the fugue is in D# minor in most scores I discovered. Although I don&#8217;t believe it matters, I&#8217;ll keep mentioning that this fugue is in D# minor.</p>



<p>This fugue begins with the first voice exposition of the theme, while the second voice (in red) imitate it. Right away, the lowest voice repeats it a second time. Bach repeats this three-bar theme four times in the first 14 bars, which shows how important this theme is to him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-1024x614.png" alt="" class="wp-image-544" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-1024x614.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-300x180.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-768x461.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-1536x921.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-640x384.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-960x576.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1.png 1884w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In order to emphasize the theme-centric nature of the fugue, the theme is repeated five times from bar 19 to bar 29, before there is an inversion (in blue). I was interested to see if the inversion is an exact mirror of the theme. I got my answer right away: no. The very first note, D#, goes to an A#, the perfect fifth. However, the inversion goes down a perfect fourth. Following these first notes, everything is mirrored.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="573" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-1024x573.png" alt="" class="wp-image-545" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-1024x573.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-300x168.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-768x430.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-1536x859.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-640x358.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-960x537.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32.png 1888w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Afterwards, the lower voice plays an augmentation of the theme (in green) at double speed. In my opinion, this is where the piece begins to climax and become more complex.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="396" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-1024x396.png" alt="" class="wp-image-546" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-1024x396.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-300x116.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-768x297.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-1536x593.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-640x247.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-960x371.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14.png 1934w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It is difficult for me to follow and analyze without assistance from here. I noticed that the theme is imitated and reversed as well as amplified and augmented throughout the entire piece, making it a complex and engaging ending.</p>

<p>I found this fugue to be slow, sorrowful, but at the same time, I found it to sometimes be beautifully harmonious. Contrary to other fugues I have heard, I believe this could be played in a church, with the long notes resonating in the long walls. Alternatively, a choral group could perform it.</p>



<p>The theme (in red) and countertheme (in brown) are presented in the first six bars of this fugue, which is interesting. The theme&#8217;s long notes are precisely counterbalanced by the countertheme&#8217;s quavers, allowing both to be heard clearly. When the third voice is added in the lower bass, it sounds really lovely to me. This produces a really fascinating and recognizable sound that binds all of the voices together.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1008" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-1024x1008.png" alt="" class="wp-image-548" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-1024x1008.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-300x295.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-768x756.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-80x80.png 80w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-640x630.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-960x945.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I was curious as to how Bach composed the theme and counter-theme to work together so beautifully, so I decided to investigate further. One thing I observed is that both melodies, especially the countertheme, move in a step-by-step manner, only leaping in the finish. This, I believe, allows the intervals to move from fifths to thirds, as seen at the start of bar 5. In addition, the opposing motion in the first two bars, when one of the melodies rises (in red) and the other falls (in blue), generates a lovely contrast and tension, which is released in the last two bars, when both move in the same direction.<gwmw style="display:none;"></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="678" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-1024x678.png" alt="" class="wp-image-549" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-1024x678.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-300x199.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-768x508.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-640x424.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-960x635.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43.png 1496w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When I previously stated that I considered this piece to be quite harmonic at moments, I was making reference to bars 13 and 14. All melodies, I suppose, have the same function here: to set the stage for the return of the theme and countertheme, but this time in a more powerful form. The theme is mostly played by the two upper voices with the thirds. This brings the piece to a close with a mini-climax.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1001" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-1001x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-550" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-1001x1024.png 1001w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-293x300.png 293w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-768x786.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-1501x1536.png 1501w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-300x307.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-640x655.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-960x982.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10.png 1604w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" /></figure>



<p>Something new appears later, at the conclusion of bar 20. The motif has been inverted (in blue). This inversion is accompanied by lower voice quavers that sound like the countertheme. I believe this is employed to have a familiar sound with this new inversion theme.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="724" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-1024x724.png" alt="" class="wp-image-551" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-1024x724.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-300x212.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-768x543.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-1536x1087.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-640x453.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-960x679.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16.png 1668w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One last thing I&#8217;d like to mention is something I don&#8217;t recall hearing in previous fugues. When two voices play similar melodies while the other two wait their time to play identical tunes. As with prior examples, most of this is done using the third interval. All of this builds up to the final theme and countertheme section.<gwmw style="display:none;"></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="355" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-1024x355.png" alt="" class="wp-image-552" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-1024x355.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-300x104.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-768x267.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-1536x533.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-2048x711.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-640x222.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-960x333.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33.png 2328w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

</h2>



<ul type="rich" class="wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Scott Joplin was a remarkable composer who was able to combine African musical influences with classical music from Europe.</li><li>Syncopation adds variety and forward movement to music, making it feel faster even when the tempos aren&#8217;t.</li><li>The I-V progression is useful for conveying comfort and familiarity.</li></ul>



<p>When researching for black composers I came across Scott Joplin, whom, I must admit, I didn&#8217;t know much of his work. Although I had heard some ragtime music before, I was far from knowing what exactly makes a ragtime song and how important it was to modern popular music.</p>



<h4 id="joplins-history">Joplin&#8217;s History</h4>



<p>Scott Joplin was born in northeastern Texas in 1867 or 1868, one of the first generation of African Americans born after slavery was abolished. His father used to be a slave, but his mother was born free. Both of Scott&#8217;s parents were performers, and he and his siblings grew up surrounded by music, primarily African traditional music performed by slaves.</p>



<p>Scott&#8217;s mother recognized his interest in music and was able to find him a free music teacher in exchange for housework. Julius Weiss, a German immigrant who, according to other students, was a follower of the European musical heritage with a special fondness for opera, was his teacher. Scott Joplin&#8217;s music owed a great deal to this. A descendant of an African slaver was not supposed to get a formal education, much less musical education. However, it was because of Weiss that he was able to understand piano technique, music theory, and, most crucially, European musical knowledge such as opera (Berlin, nd.).</p>



<h4 id="the-role-of-joplin-in-rag-music">The role of Joplin in Rag music</h4>



<p>There is no doubt that Scott Joplin&#8217;s music took on the fresh feel it had because of the convergence of African and European music. He combined the syncopation of Afro-American folk music with the harmonization and marching tempos of 19th-century European romanticism to form the ultimate combination (Jasen &amp; Tichenor, 1989). As a result, this led him to ragtime.</p>



<p>According to Grove Music Online, ragtime is &#8220;a style of popular music that flourished from the mid-1890s to 1918. Its main identifying trait is its ragged‚Äîi.e., syncopated‚Äîrhythm&#8221; (Berlin, 2013).</p>



<p>Joplin was known for his rags, particularly Maple Leaf Rag. Although it was not the first rag to be published, it was one of the most influential compositions in establishing ragtime as the first African-American music style to be widely adopted, earning him the title of King of Ragtime.</p>



<p>The Maple Leaf Rag and many other Joplin&#8217;s rags are considered Classic Rags. By &#8220;classic&#8221; we consider that the rag has a structure that &#8220;has three or four sections, each featuring a different 16-measure musical theme, or melody. In turn, these equal sections are divided into four lines of four measures each. Once a theme is played through, it is generally repeated immediately; in certain cases, it reappears later in the piece.&#8221; (The Library of Congress, Classic Rag).</p>



<p>Maple Leaf Rag is a good example of a Classic Rag since it not only follows the usual AABBACCDD pattern, is in duple meter, and has significant syncopation in the melody, but it is also very well thought out. To perform this composition successfully, you&#8217;ll need a developed pianistic talent.</p>



<p>Scott&#8217;s publisher, John Stark, believed his publications were as good as best classical music, and he promoted his view in elaborate ads. &#8220;Why are the Stark Music Co&#8217;s Rags called Classic? This is the reason: They are intellectual musical thoughts grounded in the emotional principle of humanity.&#8221; <meta charset="utf-8"> (The Library of Congress, Classic Rag).</p>

<p>This composition drew my attention since Joplin defines the rhythm, speed, and atmosphere of the music from the first bar. He doesn&#8217;t build up any anticipation, and there aren&#8217;t many opportunities for both hands to rest. After playing this rag, I can image a pianist becoming really fatigued.</p>



<p>However, I believe that the absence of build-up, along with the melody&#8217;s powerful syncopation, results in a danceable and incredibly catchy music. At the same time, for individuals who are used to classical music and marches, the continuous simple bass progression (which is usually an I-V progression) provides a very familiar and comforting feel.</p>



<p>Philosophically, I believe the contrast between the syncopated melody and the structured bass reflects Joplin&#8217;s position in the artistic culture of the period. On the one hand, having been raised in an African musical background, he came from a culture where syncopated percussion beats are very prominent and where rhythm is vital to making people dance and interact with music. On the other hand, he was given formal classical training that allowed him to learn how the best European classical composers composed their works. The Maple Leaf Rag and others demonstrate that he learned from both cultures and passed them on to the composition.</p>



<p>You can clearly hear the syncopation and the I-V progression in Maple Leaf Rag&#8217;s first bars in the A section, where the bass line plays a steady rhythm, while the melody plays a syncopated rhythm. The syncopation is prominent in the song throughout.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="252" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-1024x252.png" alt="" class="wp-image-562" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-1024x252.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-300x74.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-768x189.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-1536x378.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-2048x504.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-640x158.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-960x236.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6.png 2087w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another key point to note is that, like previous classical composers, Joplin knew how to generate tension and release it. My past hearing of folk African music led me to believe that it was heavily reliant on repetition rather than dramatic moments. In bars 7-9, you can sense the tension building up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="289" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-1024x289.png" alt="" class="wp-image-568" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-1024x289.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-300x85.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-768x217.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-1536x433.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-2048x578.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-640x181.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-960x271.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10.png 2251w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the B section, Joplin inserts chromatism to give the music a fresh perspective and, in my opinion, to instill the composition with some of his musical understanding.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="291" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-1024x291.png" alt="" class="wp-image-567" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-1024x291.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-300x85.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-768x218.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-1536x436.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-2048x582.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-640x182.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-960x273.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9.png 2087w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The modulation from Ab Major to Db Major at the beginning of the C section and back to Ab at the beginning of the D section, especially the last one, is done quite smoothly. Although the modulation to the subdominant is a common ragtime modulation, I feel Joplin handled it in a fluid manner to once again demonstrate his abilities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="308" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-1024x308.png" alt="" class="wp-image-566" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-1024x308.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-300x90.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-768x231.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-1536x462.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-2048x616.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-640x192.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-960x289.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1.png 2072w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another aspect of this music that I found intriguing is the triumphal finale, which has a counter motion between the voices and a large chord that eventually allows the pianist to rest after demonstrating his abilities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="291" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-1024x291.png" alt="" class="wp-image-564" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-1024x291.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-300x85.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-768x218.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-1536x436.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-2048x582.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-640x182.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-960x273.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7.png 2087w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Upon hearing Scott Joplin and reading about him, I concluded that he always fought for recognition. Despite the fact that Rags were not considered high-quality music, he had a formal musical education. I believe that confrontation is what caused his pieces to be considered so well-written, timeless, and a template for other styles that grew from it, including jazz.</p>



<p>After having studied both Joseph Bologne and Scott Joplin I find their similarities and differences very insightful. Both came from one musical background and were later exposed to another. But it did not impact them in the same way. The novelty and merge of cultures I was expecting, was more evident in Joplin&#8217;s music. My point is not that one is better or more relevant than the other. The two composers were inspirations and essential to composers who came after them. But when you think of music as an evolving landscape of different artistic viewpoints, I believe Joplin played a significant role in showing composers that you could mix them all and create beautiful pieces of music.</p>

<p>One thought occurred to me while I was searching for music to listen to. What is the reason for the scarcity of well-known African classical composers? I couldn&#8217;t think of one, and a quick Google search reveals that the first dozen names that come up are all white men. I recognize that my lack of knowledge stems primarily from my western culture, so I set out to find black composers, which I am glad I did.</p>

<p>One of the articles I read was from classicfm.com entitled <a href="https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/black-composers-who-made-classical-music-history/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/black-composers-who-made-classical-music-history/" target="_blank">&#8220;9 Black composers who changed the course of classical music history&#8221;.</a> The first featured composer is Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges.</p>



<p>Joseph Bologne was born to a wealthy plantation owner and his Senegalese slave mistress in Basse-Terre, Guadaloupe, in 1745. He received the best education his father could afford during the family&#8217;s move to France and grew into an exceptionally gifted student. He had professional training, as evidenced by his extensive work list, which includes a number of comedic operas, symphonies and concertos, as well as chamber works (Banat, 2001).</p>



<p>Despite his pejorative nickname of The Black Mozart (also known as The Other Mozart), I find myself wondering if it shouldn&#8217;t be the other way around. Joseph Bologne is regarded as one of the greatest composers of the 18th century, according to Marlon Daniel. He was known to frequent salons as a guest of the French nobility, including those of queen Marie Antoinette, who was an accomplished singer herself. He influenced Franz Joseph Haydn, Fran√ßois-Joseph Gossec, Carl Stamitz, and, most notably, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, making him a leader rather than a follower of trends in the musical evolution of his century (Daniel, 2021).</p>



<p>His work was innovative since his earlier compositions, according to a New York Times article. &#8220;The six-string quartets of his Opus 1 were among the first in that genre to be written in France. His three sonatas for keyboard and violin (Op. 1a) feature those instruments as equals, breaking away from the Baroque tradition of basso continuo, which was still very much in vogue&#8221; (Balter, 2020).</p>



<p>Despite how innovative Bologne&#8217;s work may have sounded after listening to his violin concertos, my mind constantly tells me that he sounds a lot like some of his contemporaries. This, I believe, is a case of knowledge bias.</p>



<p>His Violin Concerto No. 9 in G Major, Op. 8 is one of my favourite works. I was struck by the three movements&#8217; energy and rhythm, as well as the motifs he created. I couldn&#8217;t find a free score for this piece, but they can easily compete with other well-known motifs, in my humble and naive opinion. Why hasn&#8217;t his music been used in an advertisement commercial?</p>



<p>The second movement, Largo, is one of my favourites. Despite the fact that it is a slower movement, I consider it to be a continuation of the first movement&#8217;s accentuated rhythm. The syncopation provides a solid sound of descending notes in the first minute, which I find pleasing. In fact, I find this movement to be quite contemporary. While listening to him, I noticed parallels with Nicolas Britell&#8217;s, in my opinion, amazing Succession Tv Show soundtrack, particularly the Adagio in C Minor I show below.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In the end, I was thrilled about this discovery. I&#8217;m not qualified to say whether Joseph Bologne was a better composer than Mozart, but after hearing some of his works, I believe he deserves at least more credit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite not being a huge fan of the Beach Boys, I&#8217;ve always enjoyed this song, mostly because it doesn&#8217;t seem like a typical love song. But I&#8217;ve never given any thought to how this song&#8217;s melody and harmony were created.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-background has-white-background-color is-style-solid-color"><blockquote class="has-text-color has-black-color"><p>‚ÄúI love God Only Knows and its bow to the baroque that goes all the way back to 1740 and J. S. Bach. It represents the whole tradition of liturgical music that I feel is a spiritual part of Brian‚Äôs music.&#8221; &#8211; Jimmy Webb<br></p><cite>Sullivan, 2013</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I chose to explore this piece after reading this quote when researching Bach&#8217;s fugues.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="The Beach Boys: God Only Knows (Live At Unicef Concert - 1967)" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YTpzKDhdjms?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>God Only Knows is regarded as one of The Beach Boys&#8217; best songs and is adored by many musicians, including Paul McCartney who admitted this is one of his favourite songs. (Paul McCartney Comments, n.d.) Brian Wilson and Tony Asher wrote it for the Pet Sounds album with the goal of moving The Beach Boys away from a mainstream boyband sound and musically challenging the Beatles (Whatley, 2021). Paul McCartney later admitted that God Only Knows and the Pet Sounds inspired Sgt. Pepper&#8217;s Lonely Hearts Club Band. So this creative battle was won by all of us.</p>



<p>I believe the song&#8217;s theme is about the end of a relationship and the doubts that follow it. The hesitation in the opening lyrics &#8220;I may not always love you&#8221; distinguishes this song from other love songs. Throughout the lyrics and music, there is a sense of ambiguity, with a really weak tonal centre (Scott, 2019). As David Bennett&#8217;s video shows, the music modulates multiple times, and there are many reversed chords, so the sound never feels stable.</p>

<p>I read various analyses of this song, and while I think the music harmony is beautifully composed, I&#8217;m going to concentrate on melody and counterpoint because these concepts are covered in this section of the course.</p>



<p>The opposing motion between the vocal melody and the bass is the first fascinating melodic design I recognized. As I explained below, there&#8217;s a lively conversation going on between the two voices, with one going down and the other going up, and vice &#8211; versa. Even when they appear to be heading in the same direction, as in bar 3 of this example, they quickly diverge in bar 4. I believe this was written with the goal of drawing attention to the ambiguity and leaving the listener in the dark about what to expect.</p>

<p>Another section that sparked my curiosity was the bridge or brake, in which the keyboards and flute play a short instrumental passage that repeats the preceding opposite motion, but in a much more pronounced manner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="175" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-1024x175.png" alt="" class="wp-image-533" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-1024x175.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-300x51.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-768x131.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-1536x262.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-2048x350.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-640x109.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-960x164.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3.png 2190w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This bridge introduces a three-voice counterpoint that I&#8217;ve always found fascinating. I did my best to transcribe as accurately as I could, so it&#8217;s not perfect, but it allowed me to understand how the three voices work together to form triads, and how they mostly move in thirds and sixth intervals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="684" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-1024x684.png" alt="" class="wp-image-536" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-1024x684.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-300x201.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-768x513.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-1536x1027.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-2048x1369.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-640x428.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-960x642.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4.png 2078w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The music comes to a close with a round that I discussed in a previous entry.</p>



<p>Overall, I believe I enjoy this song more now that I am fully aware of the incredible labour that went into the melody and the blending of all voices. I see some parallels with Bach&#8217;s work, but I think I need to learn more about Bach&#8217;s music to really see how they might be related.</p>

<p>Before I could listen to polyphonic music, I needed to define polyphony. There are three types of music textures: monophonic, homophonic, and polyphonic (Copland, Rich and Slatkin, 2011).</p>



<p>So far, I&#8217;ve largely studied monophonic music, which is music composed using a single tune. It does not imply that the music is limited to a single instrument or vocal. Monophonic music can feature percussion and many lines, but they all play the same melody at the same time.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s contemporary popular music is predominantly homophonic. It means that a principal melody is accompanied by a chordal accompaniment. Generally, it is more pleasant to hear than monophonic music because the harmony is played in a way that elevates the main melody.</p>



<p>Polyphony is more challenging than the preceding two. It occurs when two or more melodies happen at the same moment but are unrelated to one another. One of the most distinguishing characteristics of polyphony is that it is difficult to discern which melody is the primary one because each has its own prominence.</p>



<p>I was reminded of a pop tune that contains all three types of musical textures. Come On Eileen by Dexys Midnight Runners makes it simple to understand the three principles. The song begins with a single violin playing in a monophonic texture. The sound then shifts to a homophonic texture, primarily in the chorus. Finally, in the bridge portion, all voices join together in a polyphonic texture with up to three melodies, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Proceeding to my listening of polyphonic music, I decided that it will consist of as many listenings as there are melodies, plus one. To do this, I will try to listen to each melody separately and then all of them together in one final listening.</p>

<p>This is a polyphonic composition of music for four voices (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass), and it is one of the shortest English madrigals, published in 1594.</p>



<p>After a first listen, this music seems to me like a Christmas carol, despite the fact that there is nothing in the lyrics that leads in that direction except the &#8220;cold December&#8221; section. Speaking of the lyrics, this is not a cheerful love poem, and I believe the music reflects the protagonist&#8217;s disappointment.</p>



<p>The song starts with gentle rhythms but ascending melodic lines when describing April and June as metaphors for her beauty and the warmth of her eyes.</p>



<p>But as the song progresses towards the colder months, it becomes a little melancholy and deeper, with the vocals becoming lower in pitch and dynamics. September has lengthier notes and the melodies are more similar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-1024x905.png" alt="" class="wp-image-456" width="320" height="282" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-1024x905.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-300x265.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-768x679.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-640x566.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-960x849.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33.png 1054w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></figure>



<p>The most memorable section of the music occurs in December when the tune of &#8220;But in her heart&#8221; is repeated several times by all voices. This is foreshadowing the protagonist&#8217;s disappointment when he discovers she is as cold as December, and all voices get quieter and slower.</p>



<p>For me, the most exciting part is when the voices interact, and you can hear one voice starting at one point and another voice following up where the first left. This example below exemplifies how Thomas Morley considered this, employing quavers to interact amongst the voices, crotchets, and minims when the melodies are independent. This results in a lovely soundscape.</p>

<p>Although it is polyphonic music with individual melodies, there is some round counterpoint, as shown in the examples above and below. This can demonstrate that the composer is not limited to a single style.</p>

<p>Because this is a 40-part motet, I did not follow the guideline of listening to it as many times as there are voices. </p>



<p>It was written about 1570 by Thomas Tallis for eight choirs of five voices each and is regarded as the greatest piece of English early music by certain commentators.</p>



<p>Writing polyphonic compositions is a complex job for the composer and a demanding one for the listener who tries to follow each melody alone. This is especially true for music with more than three or four melodies, so one can only imagine how impressive it is to write for 40 voices and over 11 minutes. An example of Tallis&#8217;s incredible work can be seen in the example below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="691" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-691x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-459" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-691x1024.png 691w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-202x300.png 202w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-768x1138.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-1037x1536.png 1037w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-300x445.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-640x948.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-960x1423.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52.png 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /></figure>



<p>Concentrating on individual melodies proved difficult in this situation, so I just listened to Spem in Alium as a whole choir song. I must add that it greatly surprised me and gave me a hypnotic sense due to the aural movements of the choirs. Though it is widely assumed that Tallis intended his choirs to be placed in a horseshoe form, I can only imagine how magnificent it would be to hear it live, with all eight choirs positioned in a circle around you, creating a 360¬∫ experience.</p>



<p>This piece, in my opinion, can be separated into three parts.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The first choir begins with just a few voices being formed together, then the other chorus joins them in turn. It almost sounds like a round.</li><li>Then, after a brief time when all 40 voices are singing together, we see an inverted movement from the opening section, in which the choirs follow each other in reverse order.</li><li>It is in the final section, which is more like a conversation between choirs, where this piece makes full use of its complexity, jumping between voices as it moves from choir to choir until it ends with all choirs singing together.</li></ul>



<p>Even though I didn&#8217;t find it boring, I thought the music was a bit longer than I would find interesting. Listening to it live would probably transmit the power and the spatial interactivity Tallis intended and keep it interesting for the whole 11 minutes of this piece.</p>



<h4 id="bach-prelude-and-fugue-no-17-in-ab-major-bwv-862">Bach: Prelude and Fugue No.17 in Ab major, BWV 862</h4>



<p>I was interested to listen how the polyphonic music developed from the renaissance era to the baroque. After reading some articles I found that Bach would be a great example of polyphonic baroque music, so I listened to a few of his fugues. The No.17 in Ab major was one the I liked most.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Richter plays Bach: WTC1 No. 17 in A flat major BWV 862" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gCL5Zvnt0TU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The polyphony of the late Baroque differed from that of the Renaissance: It was rooted in tonal harmony and characterized by an energetic, metrically conceived, driving rhythm (Hylton, 2005).</p>



<p>The start of the prelude really interested me because it was such a great way of opening a piece. It reminded me of some rock and heavy metal songs that start with triads in one guitar and a melody in another. </p>



<p>The theme of the prelude is repeated several times by both voices. Since polyphony can be hard to listen, this repetition of the main theme in one voice makes it sound familiar, while the other voice delivers a new and unexpected sound, making it fresh at the same time.</p>



<p>Even from the start is easy to find the differences from renaissance polyphony. More rhythm and more complexity. </p>



<p>Moving to the fugue, the new theme is clearly stated by repetition of the 4 voices, two in Ab major and two in Eb major.</p>



<p>I really like how the voices keep playing the main theme, specially when they rise for a perfect 4th or 5th as in the example below. It gives a really fresh and climatic tone to the music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="983" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-983x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-500" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-983x1024.png 983w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-288x300.png 288w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-768x800.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-1474x1536.png 1474w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-1965x2048.png 1965w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-300x313.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-640x667.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-960x1000.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2.png 2165w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></figure>



<p>Also interesting is that in bar 11 starts a new melody that is repeated by three voices, separating by a perfect 5th and a perfect 4th. This adds again a freshness to the music, and Bach makes sure that although this piece is polyphonic and complex, there is always a familiar tune to be listened.</p>

<p>I find this type of polyphony more interesting than the previous examples I listened, perhaps because I find that the complexity of notes and rhythms add more colour and interest to the piece.</p>



<h4 id="polyphony-of-dorze-people">Polyphony of Dorze People</h4>



<p>While researching polyphony, I came across this statement in the &#8216;Why do people sing?&#8217; book.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-solid-color"><blockquote><p>SubSaharan Africa is the largest and the most active region of distribution of vocal polyphony in the world.</p><cite>(Jordania, 2011)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Therefore, I decided to listen to some polyphony singing from the Dorze tribe in Ethiopia to see and understand the main differences between them and western polyphony.</p>

<p>There are two songs on this recording that I listened to:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Ritual song by young boys</li><li>Spinning song by young girls</li></ul>



<p>The first one had a drone-like effect in one of the voices while the other voices sang a repeated theme. It&#8217;s a pretty rhythmic tune, but it&#8217;s also incredibly repetitive, with the same theme running throughout.</p>



<p>The second song appears to be a three-part polyphony, with one high-pitched solo melody, another group melody, and a low-pitched rhythmical melody. This one appears to be more sophisticated than the last one and more enjoyable to listen to.</p>



<p>The biggest difference between this song and the ones I previously evaluated is that each voice is sung with a specific function in mind, such as a rhythmic voice or a harmonising voice.</p>



<h4 id="tautai-taora-ofrai-leeward-islands"><meta charset="utf-8">Tautai Taora Ofrai (Leeward Islands)</h4>



<p>Little did I know that Polynesia was one of the first places on earth to develop polyphonic music. Europeans discovered Polynesia&#8217;s long tradition of polyphonic music in the 18th century. This discovery was a shocking one for European musicians, who believed that polyphony, as an attribute of a more advanced musical civilization, could have been only a product of the Christian monastery (Jordania, 2011).</p>



<p>This is one of the examples of recorded Polynesian polyphony.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>I got the same feeling after listening to Tautai Taora Ofrai as I did after listening to Dorze People&#8217;s polyphony. It&#8217;s a song with a lot of rhythms, but it&#8217;s also very repetitive.</p>



<p>Apart from that, I found this music to have a structure, with three parts separated by a drone from one of the voices.</p>



<p>Another difference I noticed between the two listenings is that there are more voices (at least four different melodies) and that they don&#8217;t appear to have a specific role, but rather their own melodies that are distinct from the other voices.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Finally, I&#8217;d want to share one anti-polyphony viewpoint that startled me. As in the video below, polyphony was described by Vincenzo Galilei as &#8220;a big mess of incoherent imperfections&#8221;. Despite the fact that I believe these statements to be harsh, I can see why Vicenzo Galilei wrote them. Polyphony is difficult to listen to and, if not properly done, can quickly devolve into a big mess.</p>

<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Descant is a form of counterpoint, but usually is introduced after the melody is established and sang above the melody</li><li>Descants usually are written in the 3rd and 6th notes of the notes played by the melody</li><li>Although is not used in modern music, I believe it did not disappeared, just evolved</li></ul>



<p>My first step was to look up the definition of Descants. Merriam-Webster defines it as &#8220;a superimposed counterpoint to a simple melody sung typically by some or all of the sopranos&#8221;.</p>



<p>One of the definitions in The Oxford Dictionary of Music is &#8220;In modern hymn singing, a freely written or improvised soprano part added to a hymn tune while the tune itself is sung by the rest of the choir or by the congregation.&#8221; (Kennedy, Kennedy and Rutherford-Johnson, 2012).</p>



<p>In my own words, it occurs when composers introduce a melody over an already established tune and both perform flawlessly.</p>



<p>But one question arose: what is the difference between counterpoint and descant, given that both are melodies over melodies?</p>



<p>I struggled to find an answer to my question, but after some thought, I believe a descant is a type of counterpoint. However, there are two significant differences between regular and descant counterpoints:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>A descant is introduced&nbsp;when the melody has been well established, either via repetition or by being a popular melody, whereas conventional counterpoint can be used at any time. As a result, descants are frequently introduced near the end of a hymn, as as in ‚ÄòHark! the Herald Angels Sing,&#8217; as shown below.</li><li>A descant is a melody that is placed above the melody by high-pitched singers or instruments (What is a‚Ä¶ Descant?, 2021). A normal counterpoint can be placed either above or below the melody.</li></ul>



<p>The majority of the examples I discovered were from choral works. As a result, my listening will be primarily focused on two of these works.</p>

<p>The descant is only introduced in minute 2:16 of this Christmas carol, proving my claim that descants are introduced after the main melody is well established. One of the most fascinating aspects of the descant is illustrated in the image below. Both melodies have a contrary motion, so when one goes up, the other goes down. When they appear to clash (in the &#8220;of&#8221; passage), the descant descends to its lowest note, while the main melody ascends to its highest tone. This, together with the use of thirds and sixths, makes a nice contrast.</p>

<p>The descant appears¬†at the end of the song, at the 2:46 mark. And with this song, I discovered another reason to create a descant: it can give the music an apotheotic ending, as I demonstrate below. Look at how the main melody is largely made up of crochets and only utilizes 5 notes, whereas the descant melody is mostly made up of quavers and uses 8 different notes in a descending¬†&#8211; descending &#8211; ascending¬†form. This gives the song a powerful ending.</p>

<p>Later, I came across this video in which one individual I couldn&#8217;t name, claims that the descant was a noble kind of art that is now extinct.</p>

<p>I would argue that if the descant is defined by an improvised line spoken over a known tune, it is not lost but rather moved from the vocal to the guitar. Guitar solos, in my opinion, are the modern equivalent of descant. I understand that this may offend some purist music theorists, but if you think of music as an evolving form of art, it makes sense.</p>



<p>Consider the Merriam-Webster definition (a superimposed counterpoint to a simple melody sung typically by some or all of the sopranos) and consider the guitar solo as a superimposed counterpoint over a simple melody, usually played by higher-pitched sounds and usually introduced after the main melody is established.</p>



<p>There are a million examples of guitar solos, improvised or not, over a melody, but I think the 1950s blues, when the electric guitar became popular, is one fantastic example of how the vocal descant transferred to the guitar solo, or should I say guitar descant.</p>

<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Use sounds other than traticional acoustic instruments to convey an atmosphere</li><li>Keep the melody interesting by beginning notes just before or after they should begin</li><li>Surprise the audience with key changes</li></ul>



<p>For me, Stevie Wonder is an acquired taste. I didn&#8217;t love his music as much when I was younger, but as I&#8217;ve gotten older, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate and admire how he created such beautiful songs.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that his album Songs In The Key Of Life is widely regarded as his masterpiece, one of his songs that I particularly enjoy listening to is Overjoyed. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot of literature devoted to describing how Stevie Wonder composed his songs, but I wanted to understand for myself why I appreciate this song so much and what composing talents he used to achieve such a wonderful sound.</p>



<p>Previous note: I will not study the lyrics because I am more interested in melody, harmony, and rhythm at the moment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Stevie Wonder - Overjoyed ((Live in Japan))" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11kOx3xcX-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The song begins with a piano and guitar accompanied by strange sounds. Stevie Wonder refers to it as Environmental Percussion, and it consists of natural noises such as birds, crushed leaves, and stones dropped in a pond (Harrington, 1985). In fact, these water drops can be found throughout the song in the backbeat.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell which key the music starts in since it goes from C# Major 6 to C7 to B Major 7 and then back to C7. It repeats once again, but instead of going up in the last chord, it goes down to Bb.</p>



<p>This intro is such an odd way to begin a song because it doesn&#8217;t really inform you what to anticipate. When the line is descending, the listener expects it to continue descending, but the chords rise, and when it repeats, the expectation is that it will rise in the last chord, but it continues to descend. This up and down uncertainty, as well as the sounds of nature, distinguishes this song from many others.</p>



<p>When the verse begins, the chords and voice shift to Eb, the song&#8217;s key. The final Bb chord of the intro now makes sense because it is the dominant of the Eb.</p>



<p>The verse is an I-vi-ii-V progression, which is quite common, and the vocal melody is also quite simple. With such an odd beginning, you wouldn&#8217;t expect such a straightforward but wonderful verse.</p>



<p>One thing I realized is that if you listen closely to Steve&#8217;s vocal melody, he begins slightly before the rhythm, as shown in the example below. This syncopation is a subtle but crucial rhythm decision in my opinion. It appears that the singer is propelling the music ahead with vowels rather than consonants, as one might expect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="120" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1024x120.png" alt="" class="wp-image-402" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1024x120.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-300x35.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-768x90.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1536x180.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-2048x239.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-640x75.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-960x112.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When there is a repetition, Stevie Wonder goes to unexpected places, as he did in the intro. When the listener expects an ii (F minor) in the I-vi-ii-V progression in the second part of the verse, the music modulates to a C major scale, and the chords go to an F major 7 and then to a G major 7, and the B part of the verse begins in C major.</p>



<p>This game of not giving the listener what he expects is not new, but it works marvellously when it is effectively crafted.</p>



<p>When the listener expects a repetition in this B section of the verse, the music moves to another area. In this case, we expect to stay in the major key, but the third chord is a C minor, so the key shifts to a minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="441" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1024x441.png" alt="" class="wp-image-403" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1024x441.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-300x129.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-768x331.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1536x661.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-2048x882.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-640x276.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-960x413.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Following the verse, the melody gracefully transitions to the chorus, with a chromatic rise to a new chord: Ab Major. The melody drops through G &#8211; F &#8211; Eb &#8211; D, which is on the Eb major scale, so I don&#8217;t believe the music modulates to a new key signature.</p>



<p>This chorus is particularly fascinating since the chords he uses to advance to the chorus are also used to decrease in the chorus. That&#8217;s intriguing because Stevie Wonder, once again, plays with the listener&#8217;s expectations. He went up with Bb &#8211; C -D &#8211; Eb &#8211; F -G then down with G &#8211; F &#8211; Eb &#8211; D, therefore the following note should be C, but instead, he changes the chorus to C#. It&#8217;s only for a moment, but it&#8217;s a pleasant surprise. But the surprise doesn&#8217;t stop there; the chorus modulates to a new key a whole tone above, creating a fantastic climax.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="603" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1024x603.png" alt="" class="wp-image-406" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1024x603.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-300x177.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-768x453.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1536x905.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-2048x1207.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-640x377.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-960x566.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The song returns to the intro and the verse, but when the music moves to the chorus again, the melody begins in the A (just as it did in the second chorus). At this point, the listener may wonder if the chorus can get any higher. It does. Again, we modulate to a whole tone above, reaching the peak of the song.</p>



<p>As expected, the song culminates with the root note Eb after the chorus. There are no surprises at the end of the song.</p>



<p>I knew this song was beautifully crafted even before I analyzed it, but I had no idea it had so many details like the water sound, the syncopation in the verse, or the major/minor key modulations. I genuinely believe that this analysis helped me understand how to keep a song engaging without making it appear overly difficult.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A round is a musical composition in the form of a canon, and the melody is constructed in a way that produces a counterpoint when various performers or instruments begin it at different times. It is known as a &#8220;perpetual canon&#8221; since its ending works along with the opening.</p>



<p>I listened to dozens of rounds because they are typically easy and fun to listen to. I chose a few that appealed to me the most.</p>



<h3 id="the-great-bells-of-oseney">The Great Bells of Oseney</h3>



<p>This is a three-part round from 1609, but I couldn&#8217;t discover any further information about it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/deut9.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This is a pretty simple round, but it&#8217;s useful to understand how three voices are used to produce triads most of the time, particularly in the first and end beats.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="351" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-1024x351.png" alt="" class="wp-image-381" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-1024x351.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-300x103.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-768x264.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-1536x527.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-640x220.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-960x330.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells.png 1684w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>A three-part round in Hebrew from the 15th century that is frequently assigned to Johannes Ockeghem, despite the lack of strong evidence of that.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/havanashira.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The intriguing aspect of this round is that all voices have the identical note durations in the first two bars, resulting in a tremendous harmonizing sound. This pattern is disrupted in the third and fourth bars by the introduction of quavers, which creates a nice surprise.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="241" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-1024x241.png" alt="" class="wp-image-382" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-1024x241.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-300x71.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-768x181.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-1536x361.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-2048x482.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-640x151.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-960x226.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira.png 2364w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 id="hey-ho-nobody-home">Hey, ho, Nobody Home</h3>

</div></figure>



<p>A three-part round in the minor key that dates back to at least 1609.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/heyhonobody.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Typically, rounds are amusing or joyous songs, but this one is a lament sung in the D Minor scale. In contrast to the other rounds, this one employs a lot of quavers in between the chords, resulting in a more nuanced music. Another intriguing element is that the melody ends in the supertonic rather than the tonic, producing a sense of incompleteness and perpetualness.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="307" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-1024x307.png" alt="" class="wp-image-383" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-1024x307.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-300x90.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-768x231.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-640x192.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-960x288.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody.png 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>This is a popular Latin three-part round that is frequently assigned to Palestrina, however some contend that it was written by Mozart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/donanobis.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>What strikes me the most about this round is that, except the first two bars, all voices are really close together. They even end all three on the same note. When sang collectively, I believe this produces a more powerful sound, but I don&#8217;t believe the listener can follow the voices independently, which is one of the most interesting things in rounds.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="317" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-1024x317.png" alt="" class="wp-image-384" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-1024x317.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-300x93.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-768x238.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-640x198.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-960x298.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34.png 1258w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 id="go-to-joan-glover">Go to Joan Glover</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSCeV7WH2ms">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSCeV7WH2ms</a></p>



<p>This is a quick four-part round from 1609.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/joanglover.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>What I found remarkable about this round is the rhythm that all four voices repeat, almost always employing the triad. I think it&#8217;s incredibly danceable, and when sung in a group, it may make for a very energetic round.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="206" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/joan-glover-1024x206.png" alt="" class="wp-image-388" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/joan-glover-1024x206.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/joan-glover-300x60.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/joan-glover-768x155.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/joan-glover-1536x309.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/joan-glover-640x129.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/joan-glover-960x193.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/joan-glover.png 1916w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>This famous round is in A major for four voices by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="674" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57-1024x674.png" alt="" class="wp-image-389" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57-1024x674.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57-300x197.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57-768x505.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57-640x421.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57-960x632.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I was curious to hear a Mozart round, and I loved how he employed the Minims and crochets to keep the bass notes sustained. When listening to the melody with just one voice, it&#8217;s difficult to tell if there&#8217;s a top melody and a bass background, but when all voices are heard combined, it&#8217;s clear that there is.</p>

<p>Of course, I couldn&#8217;t leave Henry Purcell out of this round (pun intended).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D3TGowLoiPY/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>My favorite Purcell round was this one, which was humourous in style and delightful in how the voices sang &#8220;so kiss my arse&#8221; properly, accentuating each note with great force and confidence.</p>

<p>Although the majority of the examples I listened to were made more than a century ago, I remembered two instances from recent music that demonstrate that rounds are alive and well and may be employed in a modern context.</p>



<p>The most well-known is the final section of The Beach Boys&#8217; &#8211; God only knows. I recently watched Paul Mccartney&#8217;s documentary &#8220;McCartney 3, 2, 1,&#8221; in which he admits that Brian Wilson is one of his favorite harmony composers, and you can tell that this round is quite well composed.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Another song from the musical Rent that came¬†to mind is &#8220;Will I?&#8221; from the musical Rent. Musicals, in my opinion, are a terrific platform for writing rounds because you can work with different vocal tones, portrayed by different characters, and so create a highly dynamic song.</p>

<p>I was listening to music on Spotify on shuffle when Tim Maia&#8217;s N√£o Quero Dinheiro came on, and I had a thought: why do I feel happy every time I hear this song, particularly the chorus? I&#8217;ll try to figure it out by examining its melody.</p>

<p>Tim Maia was a Brazilian musician who is regarded as one of the country&#8217;s most influential musicians. Maia pioneered¬†sambalan√ßo with Jorge Ben, a genre that combines samba, soul, funk, and rock and roll.</p>



<p>In 1971, he recorded N√£o Quero Dinheiro, a samba/soul song in which he declares, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any money, I just want love,&#8221; in response to rising consumerism. It&#8217;s a love song that&#8217;s likely influenced by the peace and love movement of the 1960s. The song went on to become a great success. Note that Brazil was under a dictatorship at the time, and this style of music was used as an escape from oppression.</p>



<p>This song catches my attention because of its general cheerfulness and happiness just by listening to it. This is, in my opinion, to do with repetition, syncopation, and tension.</p>



<p>The song begins with a syncopated melody that is repeated twice before the variation. This is the song&#8217;s verse, and while the tone is lively, it does not reach the climax of the chorus.</p>

<p>The chorus is the most joyful element of the song, but Tim Maia&#8217;s creation of a hymn with only three notes is even more astounding. And I believe that repetition is the key. In the first part of the chorus, the A is repeated 32 times.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="238" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1024x238.png" alt="" class="wp-image-328" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1024x238.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-768x178.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1536x357.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-2048x476.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-640x149.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-960x223.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001.png 2187w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>First part of the chorus of <meta charset="utf-8">Tim Maia&#8217;s N√£o Quero Dinheiro</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you listen to this melody alone, especially on the piano, you&#8217;ll hear almost a childlike repetition. As if a child was trying to prove she was better than others. It seems like you might be able to sing &#8220;My toy is better than yours&#8221; in this melody.</p>



<p>This chorus is also characterized by tension. The song repeats itself six times, creating tension, with the hope of resolution which comes in half of the seventh bar. The repetition-tension-resolution game continues throughout the entire melody.</p>



<p>I was delighted to discover this Ted Talk about music repetition by Elizabeth Margulis, Professor and Director of Princeton University&#8217;s Music Cognition Lab.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, repetition makes you feel that music is more enjoyable, more interesting and more human. Music critics, according to Margulis, are often embarrassed by repetition, believing it to be childish or regressive; but repetition, far from being embarrassing, helps us to think of music as a way of seeing the world.</p>



<p>Not to be forgotten is Beethoven&#8217;s repeated four-note theme in his Symphony No. 5 or Ravel&#8217;s Bolero, which is composed entirely of variations on a single motif.</p>



<p>Finally, in my opinion, what makes this melody feel happy and cheery is the same childish repetition that reminds you of a period when life was simple and happy, and all you cared about was playing and being happy. And those joyful memories are made up of repeated memories.</p>

		<span>I&#8217;ve learned that I&#8217;ve always liked counterpoint.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>My tutor encouraged me to add research in my log on terminology that I wasn&#8217;t familiar with. So I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;d heard of counterpoint before, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what it meant. Therefore I decided to research it and in the process, I realized I began playing music due to the counterpoint.</p>



<p>To begin with, the basic definition of counterpoint is when at least two melodies are layered one on top of the other (Wood, 1932). Bach&#8217;s two-part Inventions (Taylor, 2012) are an example of such counterpoint:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="865" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-1024x865.png" alt="" class="wp-image-323" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-1024x865.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-300x253.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-768x649.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-640x540.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-960x811.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02.png 1376w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Although there are many examples of counterpoint, canons, and fugues in classical music, I was curious if it was applied in recent popular music.</p>



<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers were one of my favorite bands growing up, mainly because of Flea&#8217;s bass lines. That is why I decided to learn to play the bass. That was counterpoint working on rock music, I had no idea. And counterpoint was the reason I was so captivated with that band.</p>

<p>Queen was another band I grew up admiring, and Freddy Mercury and Brian May were masters of counterpoint. In this Killer Queen example, notice how the guitar and backup vocals occasionally play their own melodies:</p>

<p>I looked into other examples and realized that, while not being a band I normally listen to, Radiohead used a lot of counterpoints in their music, which made me enjoy them far more. For example, just listening to the melody of the trombone in their song Life In A Glasshouse is lovely.</p>

<p>And, since it&#8217;s Friday, here&#8217;s one more example of how the guitar, in addition to the vocal melody and band harmony, plays its own melody. The guitar is isolated in this example because I believe it is simpler to understand the melody of the guitar, and anyone who knows the song can place the voice melody on top without listening to it.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that my reflection on the counterpoint in this piece is superficial, and that thousands of pages have been written about it, but it has helped me to better comprehend the concept and develop it in my future work.</p>
