</h2>



<p>I must confess that, aside from knowing what the pentatonic scale was, I had no idea how important it was in music. I used to think it was a simple scale that was mostly used in nursery rhymes and was used as the first scale a novice learns.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that I was not mistaken, after viewing this incredible video by musician Anuja Kamat, I realized that the pentatonic scale is used all over the world.</p>

<p>But why is the pentatonic scale employed by ancient civilizations and people all across the world? Mathematics and frequency are the keys to the solution. Because all notes have a straightforward relationship between them, as illustrated in the points below, all notes sound good. As a result, they appeal to everyone&#8217;s ears.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>tonic has whatever frequency&nbsp;you first chose</li><li>supertonic has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1⅛</li><li>mediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1¼</li><li>dominant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1½</li><li>submediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1⅔</li><li>tonic (octave above) has the frequency of orginal tonic&nbsp;multiplied by 2</li></ul>



<p>The pentatonic scale appears in a variety of musical styles, which is fascinating. In the Chinese folk tune Mo Li Hua, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In the well-known Amazing Grace, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="96" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-300x28.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-768x72.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-640x60.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-960x90.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image.png 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Hold On We&#8217;re Going Home by Drake is another song that uses the pentatonic scale, which is quite prevalent in pop music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="79" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-300x23.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-768x59.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1536x119.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-2048x159.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-640x50.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-960x74.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1.png 2066w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It is also employed by classical composers. Debussy&#8217;s La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin contains another melody based on the pentatonic scale (except for an F).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.teoria.com/res/images/articles/debussy-fille-aux-cheveux-des-lin/tema.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>It makes me wonder whether maybe the pentatonic scale is the so-coveted universal language. A common language shared by people from various places, cultures, and eras. Even if two persons from completely different cultures and musical backgrounds are brought together, they may agree that these five notes sound good. </p>



<p>This Bob McFerrin story exemplifies it perfectly.</p>

<p>Although I still believe the pentatonic scale is a simple scale, I now recognize its significance in music and the vast possibilities it offers. I&#8217;m going to use them in the pentatonic scale melody project I&#8217;m working on.</p>

<p>The backstory surrounding the Toccata is fascinating. Carlos Chávez was commissioned by John Cage to create a piece for the percussion ensemble with which he was travelling. As a result, the <meta charset="utf-8">Toccata for Percussion was created. The sad part is that <meta charset="utf-8">Cage&#8217;s ensemble was unable to execute the opening movement, which requires all members to play long, continuous drum rolls, and the piece was never played. The Toccata was not performed until 1948 (Hall, 2008).</p>



<p>The moral of this story, in my opinion, is that there is a fine line between what the composer wants and what the players are capable of playing. In my compositions, I&#8217;ll try to keep this in mind.</p>



<p>This is a three-movement work composed entirely of percussion instruments, the majority of which are unpitched (or indefinite-pitched). I was expecting Latin percussion instruments, but, with the exception of the Indian Drum, all of the other instruments are standard orchestral instruments, not exotic ones.</p>



<p>After a first listen, I discovered that Chávez divided the piece into Membranes and Metalic instruments, with a few wooden instruments thrown in the mix. The wooden instruments, I believe, are used for melody and the other for rhythm.</p>



<p>In terms of the first movement, I found it to be highly interactive. Instruments can be heard playing the passing theme at different times. Other times, as in the example below, the sound shifts from low to high pitch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="448" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-1024x448.png" alt="" class="wp-image-218" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-1024x448.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-300x131.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-768x336.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-1536x671.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-2048x895.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-640x280.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-960x420.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59.png 2558w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This first movement is characterized by the eight notes, that create some of the motifs of this part.</p>



<p>When I got to the end of this movement, I realized it ended the same way it started: with a roll. Actually, rolls are present in all music and may be the Toccata&#8217;s most prominent feature. When I got to the end of the movement, I realized it ended with a roll, just like it had begun.  Because Chávez wrote these final rolls without diminuendo, I believe it will be difficult for players to keep the roll while changing the strength of strokes at the same time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="469" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-1024x469.png" alt="" class="wp-image-220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-1024x469.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-300x138.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-768x352.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-1536x704.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-2048x939.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-640x293.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-960x440.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19.png 2452w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>With the exception of the xylophone, the instruments in the second movement are all metallic. This movement seemed more mysterious to me, perhaps because of the sound of the metallic instruments and the slower tempo. But, thanks to the xylophone and glockenspiel, it&#8217;s also the most melodic of the movements. I found it particularly fascinating when all of the instruments imitated one another, resulting in a unique timbre.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-991x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-219" width="423" height="437" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-991x1024.png 991w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-290x300.png 290w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-768x794.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-300x310.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-640x661.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-960x992.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25.png 1318w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /></figure>



<p>The third movement is more complex, and I finally found the Latin rhythms I was looking for at the beginning. We return to membrane instruments in this movement, with the glockenspiel, maracas, and claves added later. This movement appears to use more sixteenth notes than the previous ones, making it feel faster. The third movement continues to be interactive, with some instruments passing the motif from one instrument to the next, like the example below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="450" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-1024x450.png" alt="" class="wp-image-221" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-1024x450.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-300x132.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-768x338.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-1536x675.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-2048x900.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-640x281.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-960x422.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36.png 2548w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>On a personal note, I found the Toccata for Percussion to be a fascinating composition in which I was able to acquire a feel of how different percussion instruments may be used to convey both rhythm and melody.</p>

		<span>Variations, rhythm and all that jazz.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>I listened to all 16 variations from Boris Blacher&#8217;s Variations On A Paganini Theme, but I was curious how it sounded and looked in a concert, so I watched a performance by the Frankfurt Radio Symphony.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>The Paganini Caprice theme fades away after a few seconds, and Blacher&#8217;s variants come to life on their own. There&#8217;s a little resemblance to it now and then, but it&#8217;s really subtle. Another thing I noticed is that Blacher strives to showcase all instruments through the variations, starting with strings, then on to woodwinds, and finally to brass. Percussion continues to come and go as the variants change. Despite the fact that I believe most of the variants to be quite vibrant rhythmically, there is no variation dedicated only to percussion.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a score, and despite the fact that different time signatures were used between variations, I couldn&#8217;t figure out if Variable Metre was used at all.</p>



<p>For me, the second&nbsp;and last two&nbsp;variations were the most intriguing. The second variation features a bluesy oboe with blue notes, which I adore (and it looks like the player from the performance I posted does too). The 15th and 16th have a jazzier flavour to them, and they remind me of big bands. That was a fantastic conclusion. &#8220;Dominant rhythm and abrupt ends are Blacher hallmarks,&#8221; (Simon, 2003) I realized after learning more about Blacher.</p>



<p>All of this jazz influence, and how he changed it into an orchestral sound, piqued my curiosity in Blacher, and I&#8217;m likely to listen to him more in the future, and perhaps include some of his influences into my works.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Side Note about Variations. I had no clue what variations were, let alone how popular Paganini&#8217;s theme was. Basically, variation form is when you take a song&#8217;s theme and investigate, mine, twist, and transform it into a new piece of art (Hough, 2013). It appears to me to be a creative exercise rather than the construction of completely new work. I enjoy the idea of variations, and I&#8217;m curious as to why there aren&#8217;t any big musicians that do variations of other artists&#8217; songs. This reminds me that some DJs are experimenting with several versions of the same song like Stereossauro did with Carlos Paredes&#8217; Verdes Anos.</p>

<p>When I was researching the tambourine, I came across Rodion Shchedrin&#8217;s Carmen Suite for string orchestra and percussion (1967). </p>

<p>A little backstory. When Shchedrin&#8217;s wife, Maya Plisetskaya, asked Shostakovich to write a new Carmen ballet, he &#8220;gently but firmly refused.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of Bizet.&#8221; After that, she asked her husband, who agreed. Shostakovich&#8217;s response demonstrates Shchedrin&#8217;s bravery. After its debut performance, the Carmen Suite was deemed &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; to Bizet&#8217;s opera and was banned by the Soviet leadership. (Plisetskaya, 2001)</p>



<p>I feel that percussion, such as tubular bells, cymbals and castanets, are used throughout Shchedrin&#8217;s score to emphasize rhythms. Although he pays homage to the original material, he frequently pushes the music in unexpected ways, heightening the atmosphere and drama.</p>



<p>On&nbsp;the&nbsp;other&nbsp;side,&nbsp;I&nbsp;find&nbsp;the&nbsp;presence&nbsp;of&nbsp;percussion&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rather&nbsp;comic&nbsp;at&nbsp;times, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;timpani&nbsp;glissando&nbsp;is&nbsp;used&nbsp;or&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;strings&nbsp;provide&nbsp;distinctive&nbsp;effects. </p>



<p>Overall, I think the experiment of using percussion to replace other instruments was a great success, and the end result was quite entertaining. If it&#8217;s superior to the original? I don&#8217;t believe it is necessary to respond.</p>



<p>It reminded me of Johnny Cash&#8217;s Hurt version. It was a risky move for producer Rick Rubin to persuade Johnny Cash to record a version of Nine Inch Nail&#8217;s Hurt. Cash refused to sing the song, which was widely regarded as one of NIN&#8217;s best. It wasn&#8217;t until he read the lyrics that Cash realized he could make his own version of the song. Finally, the singer and producer managed to create a masterpiece from a masterpiece. It wasn&#8217;t better or worse than the original; rather, it was unique. Instead of being a song about drugs and self-destruction, they transformed it into an acoustic song about the epilogue of an eventful life.</p>

<p>Like NIN/Cash&#8217;s Hurt, Bizet/Shchedrin&#8217;s Carmen can exist in the music world indefinitely as two different but interconnected works that don&#8217;t have to be judged against each other.</p>

<p>My&nbsp;first&nbsp;listening&nbsp;log&nbsp;was&nbsp;an&nbsp;assignment&nbsp;in&nbsp;which&nbsp;I&nbsp;was&nbsp;given&nbsp;a&nbsp;list&nbsp;of&nbsp;composers&nbsp;to choose&nbsp;from. I chose Honegger because I have never listened to him before. I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>



<p>I listened to Cello Sonata, H.20 and I was surprised when the III. Presto started. The music starts with a sharp cello that immediately took me to Tango sounds. I was not expecting that. But that feeling lasted for a second because the music immediately takes a rhythm that is nothing like Tango. It goes with a very paced rhythm, almost mechanical, marked by the cello and followed by the piano. Then, is the piano that marks the rhythm. For me, this is done in a very subtle but interesting way. </p>



<p>The music becomes more melodious toward the finish, and it appears that it is becoming calmer, but I believe Honegger is deceiving us. The mechanical rhythm is constant, and the apotheosis is approaching until it abruptly ends. Instead of ending in a D, as you might expect, the cello and piano end a B and a B#, respectively. That was incredible.</p>



<p>Another thing I found fascinating was listening to multiple musicians perform this piece and seeing how they approached the finish in quite different ways. Some clearly marked it, indicating that it had come to an end. Others failed to create the surprise that Honegger envisioned. But, in my perspective, Bertsch and Webber did an excellent job.</p>



<p>One last thought.</p>



<p>Because my mind was still expecting a finish, this finale remained stuck in my thoughts. The&nbsp;thing&nbsp;is,&nbsp;you&#8217;ve&nbsp;been&nbsp;rushing&nbsp;somewhere&nbsp;for&nbsp;more&nbsp;than&nbsp;3&nbsp;minutes,&nbsp;but&nbsp;you&#8217;ve&nbsp;arrived&nbsp;nowhere. Is this song about life? About being born in an instant, living your life at full speed, and having it abruptly end?</p>



<p>That reminds me of the hit tune &#8220;Road to Nowhere&#8221; by Talking Heads. I&#8217;m not suggesting David Byrne was influenced by Honegger, but the mechanically striking snare throughout the song makes you feel like you&#8217;re on your way somewhere. But as David sings, you&#8217;re not. And that is alright.</p>
