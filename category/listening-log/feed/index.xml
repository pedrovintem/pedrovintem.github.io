<p>Before I could listen to polyphonic music, I needed to define polyphony. There are three types of music textures: monophonic, homophonic, and polyphonic (Copland, Rich and Slatkin, 2011).</p>



<p>So far, I&#8217;ve largely studied monophonic music, which is music composed using a single tune. It does not imply that the music is limited to a single instrument or vocal. Monophonic music can feature percussion and many lines, but they all play the same melody at the same time.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s contemporary popular music is predominantly homophonic. It means that a principal melody is accompanied by a chordal accompaniment. Generally, it is more pleasant to hear than monophonic music because the harmony is played in a way that elevates the main melody.</p>



<p>Polyphony is more challenging than the preceding two. It occurs when two or more melodies happen at the same moment but are unrelated to one another. One of the most distinguishing characteristics of polyphony is that it is difficult to discern which melody is the primary one because each has its own prominence.</p>



<p>I was reminded of a pop tune that contains all three types of musical textures. Come On Eileen by Dexys Midnight Runners makes it simple to understand the three principles. The song begins with a single violin playing in a monophonic texture. The sound then shifts to a homophonic texture, primarily in the chorus. Finally, in the bridge portion, all voices join together in a polyphonic texture with up to three melodies, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Proceeding to my listening of polyphonic music, I decided that it will consist of as many listenings as there are melodies, plus one. To do this, I will try to listen to each melody separately and then all of them together in one final listening.</p>

<p>This is a polyphonic composition of music for four voices (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass), and it is one of the shortest English madrigals, published in 1594.</p>



<p>After a first listen, this music seems to me like a Christmas carol, despite the fact that there is nothing in the lyrics that leads in that direction except the &#8220;cold December&#8221; section. Speaking of the lyrics, this is not a cheerful love poem, and I believe the music reflects the protagonist&#8217;s disappointment.</p>



<p>The song starts with gentle rhythms but ascending melodic lines when describing April and June as metaphors for her beauty and the warmth of her eyes.</p>



<p>But as the song progresses towards the colder months, it becomes a little melancholy and deeper, with the vocals becoming lower in pitch and dynamics. September has lengthier notes and the melodies are more similar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-1024x905.png" alt="" class="wp-image-456" width="320" height="282" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-1024x905.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-300x265.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-768x679.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-640x566.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-960x849.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33.png 1054w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></figure>



<p>The most memorable section of the music occurs in December when the tune of &#8220;But in her heart&#8221; is repeated several times by all voices. This is foreshadowing the protagonist&#8217;s disappointment when he discovers she is as cold as December, and all voices get quieter and slower.</p>



<p>For me, the most exciting part is when the voices interact, and you can hear one voice starting at one point and another voice following up where the first left. This example below exemplifies how Thomas Morley considered this, employing quavers to interact amongst the voices, crotchets, and minims when the melodies are independent. This results in a lovely soundscape.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.03.10.png" alt="" class="wp-image-453" width="382" height="252" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.03.10.png 992w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.03.10-300x198.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.03.10-768x508.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.03.10-640x423.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.03.10-960x635.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /></figure>



<p>Although it is polyphonic music with individual melodies, there is some round counterpoint, as shown in the examples above and below. This can demonstrate that the composer is not limited to a single style.</p>

<p>Because this is a 40-part motet, I did not follow the guideline of listening to it as many times as there are voices. </p>



<p>It was written about 1570 by Thomas Tallis for eight choirs of five voices each and is regarded as the greatest piece of English early music by certain commentators.</p>



<p>Writing polyphonic compositions is a complex job for the composer and a demanding one for the listener who tries to follow each melody alone. This is especially true for music with more than three or four melodies, so one can only imagine how impressive it is to write for 40 voices and over 11 minutes. An example of Tallis&#8217;s incredible work can be seen in the example below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="691" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-691x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-459" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-691x1024.png 691w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-202x300.png 202w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-768x1138.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-1037x1536.png 1037w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-300x445.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-640x948.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-960x1423.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52.png 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /></figure>



<p>Concentrating on individual melodies proved difficult in this situation, so I just listened to Spem in Alium as a whole choir song. I must add that it greatly surprised me and gave me a hypnotic sense due to the aural movements of the choirs. Though it is widely assumed that Tallis intended his choirs to be placed in a horseshoe form, I can only imagine how magnificent it would be to hear it live, with all eight choirs positioned in a circle around you, creating a 360º experience.</p>



<p>This piece, in my opinion, can be separated into three parts.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The first choir begins with just a few voices being formed together, then the other chorus joins them in turn. It almost sounds like a round.</li><li>Then, after a brief time when all 40 voices are singing together, we see an inverted movement from the opening section, in which the choirs follow each other in reverse order.</li><li>It is in the final section, which is more like a conversation between choirs, where this piece makes full use of its complexity, jumping between voices as it moves from choir to choir until it ends with all choirs singing together.</li></ul>



<p>Even though I didn&#8217;t find it boring, I thought the music was a bit longer than I would find interesting. Listening to it live would probably transmit the power and the spatial interactivity Tallis intended and keep it interesting for the whole 11 minutes of this piece.</p>



<h4 id="bach-prelude-and-fugue-no-17-in-ab-major-bwv-862">Bach: Prelude and Fugue No.17 in Ab major, BWV 862</h4>



<p>I was interested to listen how the polyphonic music developed from the renaissance era to the baroque. After reading some articles I found that Bach would be a great example of polyphonic baroque music, so I listened to a few of his fugues. The No.17 in Ab major was one the I liked most.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Richter plays Bach: WTC1 No. 17 in A flat major BWV 862" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gCL5Zvnt0TU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The polyphony of the late Baroque differed from that of the Renaissance: It was rooted in tonal harmony and characterized by an energetic, metrically conceived, driving rhythm (Hylton, 2005).</p>



<p>The start of the prelude really interested me because it was such a great way of opening a piece. It reminded me of some rock and heavy metal songs that start with triads in one guitar and a melody in another. </p>



<p>The theme of the prelude is repeated several times by both voices. Since polyphony can be hard to listen, this repetition of the main theme in one voice makes it sound familiar, while the other voice delivers a new and unexpected sound, making it fresh at the same time.</p>



<p>Even from the start is easy to find the differences from renaissance polyphony. More rhythm and more complexity. </p>



<p>Moving to the fugue, the new theme is clearly stated by repetition of the 4 voices, two in Ab major and two in Eb major.</p>



<p>I really like how the voices keep playing the main theme, specially when they rise for a perfect 4th or 5th as in the example below. It gives a really fresh and climatic tone to the music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="983" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-983x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-500" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-983x1024.png 983w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-288x300.png 288w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-768x800.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-1474x1536.png 1474w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-1965x2048.png 1965w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-300x313.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-640x667.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-960x1000.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2.png 2165w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></figure>



<p>Also interesting is that in bar 11 starts a new melody that is repeated by three voices, separating by a perfect 5th and a perfect 4th. This adds again a freshness to the music, and Bach makes sure that although this piece is polyphonic and complex, there is always a familiar tune to be listened.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="962" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-962x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-498" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-962x1024.png 962w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-282x300.png 282w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-768x818.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-1443x1536.png 1443w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-1924x2048.png 1924w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-300x319.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-640x681.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-960x1022.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2.png 2165w" sizes="(max-width: 962px) 100vw, 962px" /></figure>

<p>I find this type of polyphony more interesting than the previous examples I listened, perhaps because I find that the complexity of notes and rhythms add more colour and interest to the piece.</p>



<h4 id="polyphony-of-dorze-people">Polyphony of Dorze People</h4>



<p>While researching polyphony, I came across this statement in the &#8216;Why do people sing?&#8217; book.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-solid-color"><blockquote><p>SubSaharan Africa is the largest and the most active region of distribution of vocal polyphony in the world.</p><cite>(Jordania, 2011)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Therefore, I decided to listen to some polyphony singing from the Dorze tribe in Ethiopia to see and understand the main differences between them and western polyphony.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>There are two songs on this recording that I listened to:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Ritual song by young boys</li><li>Spinning song by young girls</li></ul>



<p>The first one had a drone-like effect in one of the voices while the other voices sang a repeated theme. It&#8217;s a pretty rhythmic tune, but it&#8217;s also incredibly repetitive, with the same theme running throughout.</p>



<p>The second song appears to be a three-part polyphony, with one high-pitched solo melody, another group melody, and a low-pitched rhythmical melody. This one appears to be more sophisticated than the last one and more enjoyable to listen to.</p>



<p>The biggest difference between this song and the ones I previously evaluated is that each voice is sung with a specific function in mind, such as a rhythmic voice or a harmonising voice.</p>



<h4 id="tautai-taora-ofrai-leeward-islands"><meta charset="utf-8">Tautai Taora Ofrai (Leeward Islands)</h4>



<p>Little did I know that Polynesia was one of the first places on earth to develop polyphonic music. Europeans discovered Polynesia&#8217;s long tradition of polyphonic music in the 18th century. This discovery was a shocking one for European musicians, who believed that polyphony, as an attribute of a more advanced musical civilization, could have been only a product of the Christian monastery (Jordania, 2011).</p>



<p>This is one of the examples of recorded Polynesian polyphony.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>I got the same feeling after listening to Tautai Taora Ofrai as I did after listening to Dorze People&#8217;s polyphony. It&#8217;s a song with a lot of rhythms, but it&#8217;s also very repetitive.</p>



<p>Apart from that, I found this music to have a structure, with three parts separated by a drone from one of the voices.</p>



<p>Another difference I noticed between the two listenings is that there are more voices (at least four different melodies) and that they don&#8217;t appear to have a specific role, but rather their own melodies that are distinct from the other voices.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Finally, I&#8217;d want to share one anti-polyphony viewpoint that startled me. As in the video below, polyphony was described by Vincenzo Galilei as &#8220;a big mess of incoherent imperfections&#8221;. Despite the fact that I believe these statements to be harsh, I can see why Vicenzo Galilei wrote them. Polyphony is difficult to listen to and, if not properly done, can quickly devolve into a big mess.</p>

<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Descant is a form of counterpoint, but usually is introduced after the melody is established and sang above the melody</li><li>Descants usually are written in the 3rd and 6th notes of the notes played by the melody</li><li>Although is not used in modern music, I believe it did not disappeared, just evolved</li></ul>



<p>My first step was to look up the definition of Descants. Merriam-Webster defines it as &#8220;a superimposed counterpoint to a simple melody sung typically by some or all of the sopranos&#8221;.</p>



<p>One of the definitions in The Oxford Dictionary of Music is &#8220;In modern hymn singing, a freely written or improvised soprano part added to a hymn tune while the tune itself is sung by the rest of the choir or by the congregation.&#8221; (Kennedy, Kennedy and Rutherford-Johnson, 2012).</p>



<p>In my own words, it occurs when composers introduce a melody over an already established tune and both perform flawlessly.</p>



<p>But one question arose: what is the difference between counterpoint and descant, given that both are melodies over melodies?</p>



<p>I struggled to find an answer to my question, but after some thought, I believe a descant is a type of counterpoint. However, there are two significant differences between regular and descant counterpoints:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>A descant is introduced&nbsp;when the melody has been well established, either via repetition or by being a popular melody, whereas conventional counterpoint can be used at any time. As a result, descants are frequently introduced near the end of a hymn, as as in ‘Hark! the Herald Angels Sing,&#8217; as shown below.</li><li>A descant is a melody that is placed above the melody by high-pitched singers or instruments (What is a… Descant?, 2021). A normal counterpoint can be placed either above or below the melody.</li></ul>



<p>The majority of the examples I discovered were from choral works. As a result, my listening will be primarily focused on two of these works.</p>

<p>The descant is only introduced in minute 2:16 of this Christmas carol, proving my claim that descants are introduced after the main melody is well established. One of the most fascinating aspects of the descant is illustrated in the image below. Both melodies have a contrary motion, so when one goes up, the other goes down. When they appear to clash (in the &#8220;of&#8221; passage), the descant descends to its lowest note, while the main melody ascends to its highest tone. This, together with the use of thirds and sixths, makes a nice contrast.</p>

<p>The descant appears at the end of the song, at the 2:46 mark. And with this song, I discovered another reason to create a descant: it can give the music an apotheotic ending, as I demonstrate below. Look at how the main melody is largely made up of crochets and only utilizes 5 notes, whereas the descant melody is mostly made up of quavers and uses 8 different notes in a descending &#8211; descending &#8211; ascending form. This gives the song a powerful ending.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="244" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-12.27.04-1024x244.png" alt="" class="wp-image-432" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-12.27.04-1024x244.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-12.27.04-300x71.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-12.27.04-768x183.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-12.27.04-1536x365.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-12.27.04-640x152.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-12.27.04-960x228.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-12.27.04.png 1908w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Later, I came across this video in which one individual I couldn&#8217;t name, claims that the descant was a noble kind of art that is now extinct.</p>

<p>I would argue that if the descant is defined by an improvised line spoken over a known tune, it is not lost but rather moved from the vocal to the guitar. Guitar solos, in my opinion, are the modern equivalent of descant. I understand that this may offend some purist music theorists, but if you think of music as an evolving form of art, it makes sense.</p>



<p>Consider the Merriam-Webster definition (a superimposed counterpoint to a simple melody sung typically by some or all of the sopranos) and consider the guitar solo as a superimposed counterpoint over a simple melody, usually played by higher-pitched sounds and usually introduced after the main melody is established.</p>



<p>There are a million examples of guitar solos, improvised or not, over a melody, but I think the 1950s blues, when the electric guitar became popular, is one fantastic example of how the vocal descant transferred to the guitar solo, or should I say guitar descant.</p>

<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Use sounds other than traticional acoustic instruments to convey an atmosphere</li><li>Keep the melody interesting by beginning notes just before or after they should begin</li><li>Surprise the audience with key changes</li></ul>



<p>For me, Stevie Wonder is an acquired taste. I didn&#8217;t love his music as much when I was younger, but as I&#8217;ve gotten older, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate and admire how he created such beautiful songs.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that his album Songs In The Key Of Life is widely regarded as his masterpiece, one of his songs that I particularly enjoy listening to is Overjoyed. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot of literature devoted to describing how Stevie Wonder composed his songs, but I wanted to understand for myself why I appreciate this song so much and what composing talents he used to achieve such a wonderful sound.</p>



<p>Previous note: I will not study the lyrics because I am more interested in melody, harmony, and rhythm at the moment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Stevie Wonder - Overjoyed ((Live in Japan))" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11kOx3xcX-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The song begins with a piano and guitar accompanied by strange sounds. Stevie Wonder refers to it as Environmental Percussion, and it consists of natural noises such as birds, crushed leaves, and stones dropped in a pond (Harrington, 1985). In fact, these water drops can be found throughout the song in the backbeat.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell which key the music starts in since it goes from C# Major 6 to C7 to B Major 7 and then back to C7. It repeats once again, but instead of going up in the last chord, it goes down to Bb.</p>



<p>This intro is such an odd way to begin a song because it doesn&#8217;t really inform you what to anticipate. When the line is descending, the listener expects it to continue descending, but the chords rise, and when it repeats, the expectation is that it will rise in the last chord, but it continues to descend. This up and down uncertainty, as well as the sounds of nature, distinguishes this song from many others.</p>



<p>When the verse begins, the chords and voice shift to Eb, the song&#8217;s key. The final Bb chord of the intro now makes sense because it is the dominant of the Eb.</p>



<p>The verse is an I-vi-ii-V progression, which is quite common, and the vocal melody is also quite simple. With such an odd beginning, you wouldn&#8217;t expect such a straightforward but wonderful verse.</p>



<p>One thing I realized is that if you listen closely to Steve&#8217;s vocal melody, he begins slightly before the rhythm, as shown in the example below. This syncopation is a subtle but crucial rhythm decision in my opinion. It appears that the singer is propelling the music ahead with vowels rather than consonants, as one might expect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="120" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1024x120.png" alt="" class="wp-image-402" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1024x120.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-300x35.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-768x90.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1536x180.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-2048x239.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-640x75.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-960x112.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When there is a repetition, Stevie Wonder goes to unexpected places, as he did in the intro. When the listener expects an ii (F minor) in the I-vi-ii-V progression in the second part of the verse, the music modulates to a C major scale, and the chords go to an F major 7 and then to a G major 7, and the B part of the verse begins in C major.</p>



<p>This game of not giving the listener what he expects is not new, but it works marvellously when it is effectively crafted.</p>



<p>When the listener expects a repetition in this B section of the verse, the music moves to another area. In this case, we expect to stay in the major key, but the third chord is a C minor, so the key shifts to a minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="441" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1024x441.png" alt="" class="wp-image-403" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1024x441.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-300x129.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-768x331.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1536x661.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-2048x882.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-640x276.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-960x413.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Following the verse, the melody gracefully transitions to the chorus, with a chromatic rise to a new chord: Ab Major. The melody drops through G &#8211; F &#8211; Eb &#8211; D, which is on the Eb major scale, so I don&#8217;t believe the music modulates to a new key signature.</p>



<p>This chorus is particularly fascinating since the chords he uses to advance to the chorus are also used to decrease in the chorus. That&#8217;s intriguing because Stevie Wonder, once again, plays with the listener&#8217;s expectations. He went up with Bb &#8211; C -D &#8211; Eb &#8211; F -G then down with G &#8211; F &#8211; Eb &#8211; D, therefore the following note should be C, but instead, he changes the chorus to C#. It&#8217;s only for a moment, but it&#8217;s a pleasant surprise. But the surprise doesn&#8217;t stop there; the chorus modulates to a new key a whole tone above, creating a fantastic climax.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="603" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1024x603.png" alt="" class="wp-image-406" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1024x603.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-300x177.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-768x453.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1536x905.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-2048x1207.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-640x377.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-960x566.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The song returns to the intro and the verse, but when the music moves to the chorus again, the melody begins in the A (just as it did in the second chorus). At this point, the listener may wonder if the chorus can get any higher. It does. Again, we modulate to a whole tone above, reaching the peak of the song.</p>



<p>As expected, the song culminates with the root note Eb after the chorus. There are no surprises at the end of the song.</p>



<p>I knew this song was beautifully crafted even before I analyzed it, but I had no idea it had so many details like the water sound, the syncopation in the verse, or the major/minor key modulations. I genuinely believe that this analysis helped me understand how to keep a song engaging without making it appear overly difficult.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A round is a musical composition in the form of a canon, and the melody is constructed in a way that produces a counterpoint when various performers or instruments begin it at different times. It is known as a &#8220;perpetual canon&#8221; since its ending works along with the opening.</p>



<p>I listened to dozens of rounds because they are typically easy and fun to listen to. I chose a few that appealed to me the most.</p>



<h3 id="the-great-bells-of-oseney">The Great Bells of Oseney</h3>



<p>This is a three-part round from 1609, but I couldn&#8217;t discover any further information about it.</p>

<p>This is a pretty simple round, but it&#8217;s useful to understand how three voices are used to produce triads most of the time, particularly in the first and end beats.</p>

<p>A three-part round in Hebrew from the 15th century that is frequently assigned to Johannes Ockeghem, despite the lack of strong evidence of that.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/havanashira.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The intriguing aspect of this round is that all voices have the identical note durations in the first two bars, resulting in a tremendous harmonizing sound. This pattern is disrupted in the third and fourth bars by the introduction of quavers, which creates a nice surprise.</p>

<p>A three-part round in the minor key that dates back to at least 1609.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/heyhonobody.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Typically, rounds are amusing or joyous songs, but this one is a lament sung in the D Minor scale. In contrast to the other rounds, this one employs a lot of quavers in between the chords, resulting in a more nuanced music. Another intriguing element is that the melody ends in the supertonic rather than the tonic, producing a sense of incompleteness and perpetualness.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/donanobis.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>What strikes me the most about this round is that, except the first two bars, all voices are really close together. They even end all three on the same note. When sang collectively, I believe this produces a more powerful sound, but I don&#8217;t believe the listener can follow the voices independently, which is one of the most interesting things in rounds.</p>

<p>This is a quick four-part round from 1609.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/joanglover.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>What I found remarkable about this round is the rhythm that all four voices repeat, almost always employing the triad. I think it&#8217;s incredibly danceable, and when sung in a group, it may make for a very energetic round.</p>

<p>I was curious to hear a Mozart round, and I loved how he employed the Minims and crochets to keep the bass notes sustained. When listening to the melody with just one voice, it&#8217;s difficult to tell if there&#8217;s a top melody and a bass background, but when all voices are heard combined, it&#8217;s clear that there is.</p>

<p>My favorite Purcell round was this one, which was humourous in style and delightful in how the voices sang &#8220;so kiss my arse&#8221; properly, accentuating each note with great force and confidence.</p>

<p>Although the majority of the examples I listened to were made more than a century ago, I remembered two instances from recent music that demonstrate that rounds are alive and well and may be employed in a modern context.</p>



<p>The most well-known is the final section of The Beach Boys&#8217; &#8211; God only knows. I recently watched Paul Mccartney&#8217;s documentary &#8220;McCartney 3, 2, 1,&#8221; in which he admits that Brian Wilson is one of his favorite harmony composers, and you can tell that this round is quite well composed.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Another song from the musical Rent that came to mind is &#8220;Will I?&#8221; from the musical Rent. Musicals, in my opinion, are a terrific platform for writing rounds because you can work with different vocal tones, portrayed by different characters, and so create a highly dynamic song.</p>

</h2>



<p>I was listening to music on Spotify on shuffle when Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro came on, and I had a thought: why do I feel happy every time I hear this song, particularly the chorus? I&#8217;ll try to figure it out by examining its melody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>Tim Maia was a Brazilian musician who is regarded as one of the country&#8217;s most influential musicians. Maia pioneered sambalanço with Jorge Ben, a genre that combines samba, soul, funk, and rock and roll.</p>



<p>In 1971, he recorded Não Quero Dinheiro, a samba/soul song in which he declares, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any money, I just want love,&#8221; in response to rising consumerism. It&#8217;s a love song that&#8217;s likely influenced by the peace and love movement of the 1960s. The song went on to become a great success. Note that Brazil was under a dictatorship at the time, and this style of music was used as an escape from oppression.</p>



<p>This song catches my attention because of its general cheerfulness and happiness just by listening to it. This is, in my opinion, to do with repetition, syncopation, and tension.</p>



<p>The song begins with a syncopated melody that is repeated twice before the variation. This is the song&#8217;s verse, and while the tone is lively, it does not reach the climax of the chorus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="247" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-1024x247.png" alt="" class="wp-image-327" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-1024x247.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-300x72.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-768x185.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-1536x370.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-640x154.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-960x231.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10.png 1610w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>First verse of Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro</figcaption></figure>



<p>The chorus is the most joyful element of the song, but Tim Maia&#8217;s creation of a hymn with only three notes is even more astounding. And I believe that repetition is the key. In the first part of the chorus, the A is repeated 32 times.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="238" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1024x238.png" alt="" class="wp-image-328" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1024x238.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-768x178.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1536x357.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-2048x476.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-640x149.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-960x223.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001.png 2187w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>First part of the chorus of <meta charset="utf-8">Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you listen to this melody alone, especially on the piano, you&#8217;ll hear almost a childlike repetition. As if a child was trying to prove she was better than others. It seems like you might be able to sing &#8220;My toy is better than yours&#8221; in this melody.</p>



<p>This chorus is also characterized by tension. The song repeats itself six times, creating tension, with the hope of resolution which comes in half of the seventh bar. The repetition-tension-resolution game continues throughout the entire melody.</p>



<p>I was delighted to discover this Ted Talk about music repetition by Elizabeth Margulis, Professor and Director of Princeton University&#8217;s Music Cognition Lab.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, repetition makes you feel that music is more enjoyable, more interesting and more human. Music critics, according to Margulis, are often embarrassed by repetition, believing it to be childish or regressive; but repetition, far from being embarrassing, helps us to think of music as a way of seeing the world.</p>



<p>Not to be forgotten is Beethoven&#8217;s repeated four-note theme in his Symphony No. 5 or Ravel&#8217;s Bolero, which is composed entirely of variations on a single motif.</p>



<p>Finally, in my opinion, what makes this melody feel happy and cheery is the same childish repetition that reminds you of a period when life was simple and happy, and all you cared about was playing and being happy. And those joyful memories are made up of repeated memories.</p>

		<span>I&#8217;ve learned that I&#8217;ve always liked counterpoint.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>My tutor encouraged me to add research in my log on terminology that I wasn&#8217;t familiar with. So I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;d heard of counterpoint before, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what it meant. Therefore I decided to research it and in the process, I realized I began playing music due to the counterpoint.</p>



<p>To begin with, the basic definition of counterpoint is when at least two melodies are layered one on top of the other (Wood, 1932). Bach&#8217;s two-part Inventions (Taylor, 2012) are an example of such counterpoint:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="865" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-1024x865.png" alt="" class="wp-image-323" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-1024x865.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-300x253.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-768x649.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-640x540.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-960x811.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02.png 1376w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Although there are many examples of counterpoint, canons, and fugues in classical music, I was curious if it was applied in recent popular music.</p>



<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers were one of my favorite bands growing up, mainly because of Flea&#8217;s bass lines. That is why I decided to learn to play the bass. That was counterpoint working on rock music, I had no idea. And counterpoint was the reason I was so captivated with that band.</p>

<p>Queen was another band I grew up admiring, and Freddy Mercury and Brian May were masters of counterpoint. In this Killer Queen example, notice how the guitar and backup vocals occasionally play their own melodies:</p>

<p>I looked into other examples and realized that, while not being a band I normally listen to, Radiohead used a lot of counterpoints in their music, which made me enjoy them far more. For example, just listening to the melody of the trombone in their song Life In A Glasshouse is lovely.</p>

<p>And, since it&#8217;s Friday, here&#8217;s one more example of how the guitar, in addition to the vocal melody and band harmony, plays its own melody. The guitar is isolated in this example because I believe it is simpler to understand the melody of the guitar, and anyone who knows the song can place the voice melody on top without listening to it.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that my reflection on the counterpoint in this piece is superficial, and that thousands of pages have been written about it, but it has helped me to better comprehend the concept and develop it in my future work.</p>

<p>The purpose of project 6 is to examine at least two solo wind instrument works from a provided list. It is recommended to keep the following observations in mind:</p>

		<span>Jacques Ibert – Pièce for flute alone</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>This work, written in 1936, was influenced by the movement started by&nbsp;Debussy&#8217;s Syrinx, to&nbsp;write&nbsp;for flute without accompaniment (Lee, 2018). Flute pieces were not very prevalent during the baroque era as solo instrument.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until the instrument&#8217;s development around the turn of the XX&nbsp;century that a large number of flute players emerged and began commissioning new works for the instrument. (Toff,&nbsp;2012). Pièce for solo flute by Jaques Ibert was written for the French flautist Marcel Moyse.</p>

<p>This piece&#8217;s theme appeals to me much. It&#8217;s actually really simple. The supertonic and tonic dotted crochets are followed by six quavers, all in the Db scale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="168" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png" alt="" class="wp-image-267" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png 724w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-640x149.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p>I find this theme particularly appealing because these two notes work together like a sigh. The supertonic represents an inhale and the tonic represents a exhale. Since this piece was written in 1937, between the two great wars, I would say that its motif captures both the hope and disbelief of humanity. Are we going to be at war again? Perhaps not. Inhale. Or most likely, yes. Exhale. After these two notes, there is an answer to the question. Occasionally, they are optimistic and go up (bars 25 and 26), but they are usually pessimistic and go down.</p>



<p>There are 4 parts to this piece: Introduction &#8211; Part A &#8211; Part B &#8211; Part A&#8217;.</p>



<h2 id="introduction" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876025605 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Introduction</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The work begins with a gradual but increasing repetition of D, eventually developing to a quicker sequence of semiquavers and demisemiquavers. This introduction includes a rhythmic portion as well as a wide range of notes that demonstrate the flute&#8217;s tonal diversity. D4 to D6. It culminates in an ascension that leads to the main theme.</p>



<h2 id="part-a" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875870212 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The theme is presented and repeated to establish that this will be a recurring motif in all music and that the listener will remember it. Following that, Ibert interacts with the theme and cadence, frequently ending in surprising notes. It continues until bar 34, when it returns to the original theme but briefly switches to the Gb scale before returning to the D. The question (are we going to be at war?) is left unresolved at the end of this section.</p>



<h2 id="part-b" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876008964 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part B</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Part A is disrupted by this section. It momentarily switches to 9/8 time signature before switching to 3/4 &#8211; 2/4. There&#8217;s also a wave-like tune that conveys some anxiousness and unease. This is also sensed as we transition from a major to a minor scale. It&#8217;s the song&#8217;s most energizing section.</p>



<h2 id="part-a-2" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875998799 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A&#8217;</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>We return to the motif, but this time raised an octave. I believe that the composer needed to bring the listener back to the familiarity of the theme without losing the rush because we just came from such an exciting section. The melody then returns to its original octave, bringing us back home. We keep the sigh, just like we did at the start because the music provides no answers to the initial inquiry. Inhale, then exhale. And the piece ends in Db, which is a semitone below the composition&#8217;s starting note. The Db is repeated in the last bar, but two octaves lower. I don&#8217;t think it contributes anything to the finish and, in my opinion, should be omitted, just as Moyse did in the performance above.</p>



<p>When I started researching for this piece, I discovered that this is one of the most popular pieces among flute students. I&#8217;m beginning to see why. Ibert demonstrates the flute&#8217;s versatility throughout these 5 minutes of music, from trills to rapidly rising and falling scales, to the lovely two notes from the theme that, if performed effectively, can convey the optimism/pessimism duality that I believe the composer was attempting to portray.</p>



<h2 id="alan-hovhaness-lament-for-clarinet" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629880624643 is-style-cnvs-block-section-heading-6 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Alan Hovhaness &#8211; Lament for Clarinet</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Hovhaness was an Armenian-American composer who lived in the United States. Although I can&#8217;t discover a backstory for the Lament for Clarinet (1935), the Armenian exodus is a central motif in his Exile Symphony, which was written a year later (1936). (Athens, 2016). As a result, it&#8217;s plausible to assume that this sombre work was influenced by the Armenian situation in the United States and around the world.</p>

<p>This piece doesn&#8217;t appear to have a rigid structure, except for the main theme in bar 23 that is repeated with variations several times. There is also a motif featured at the beginning of the piece and repeated intermittently throughout.</p>



<p>The main theme consists of a fast rise from F to C, which is then sustained for nearly a full bar. Then there&#8217;s a quaver-crochet pattern that creates the impression that the character is walking or moving, but extremely slowly, as if dragging something, like a great pain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="211" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-1024x211.png" alt="" class="wp-image-276" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-1024x211.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-300x62.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-768x158.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-1536x317.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-640x132.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-960x198.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35.png 1640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The first notes, in my opinion, do an excellent job of portraying the composer&#8217;s grief. It reminds me of Sodade, a song by Cape Verdean singer Cesária Évora. It&#8217;s also a lament for her hometown, which she misses. The chorus&#8217;s initial two notes are a fast rise from G&nbsp;to C, akin to Hovaness&#8217; piece.</p>

<p>This informs me that the clarinet is excellent at resonating with the human voice, which I believe Hovaness was attempting to demonstrate in this piece. The clarinet sings a human grief.</p>



<p>This piece begins with a fast crescendo that demonstrates the clarinet&#8217;s vast range (F3 to C6). Everything slows down after this fast crescendo, with long sustained notes and a bend. I had no idea the clarinet could bend notes, which is fascinating to me. It has a lot of potentials to enhance mourning, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The composer then begins his exploration of the clarinet&#8217;s chalumeau register, with lower pitch notes, which, once again, is an excellent choice for passing the song&#8217;s sadness.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t figure out what scale the composer is using, although the majority of the notes picked sound exotic to me. I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s an Indian scale.</p>



<p>The theme is repeated four times, each time with slight modifications, but always ending on a lower pitch than when it began. It seems to be stating that no matter how hard the character tries to move up, it always ends up going down.</p>



<p>Then, with the reprise of the rising from the song&#8217;s beginning, there&#8217;s a ray of hope. A repetition of bars 19-21,  but again we return to a lower tone as if the character refuses to let go of his or her misery. Several times, hitting&nbsp;the same note, A.</p>



<p>We return to the main theme, always with the sadness of concluding on a lower tone than we began.</p>



<p>Here we begin a dialogue between hope and lament. Hope is a repetition of the preceding fast-rising, but this time it ascends to Db6, the highest note in all music. It&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s our character&#8217;s final hope, followed by a repeat of the first bar. Our character, on the other hand, gives up and plays the same notes for two bars.</p>



<p>Hopes responds by repeating the ascending to the highest tone. However, our character is slowly dying (the composer wrote the morendo in the score), with the semiquavers and crochets gradually fading to the low notes.</p>



<p>This composition struck me as very sad, and I believe that was the composer&#8217;s intention. Probably because of its history and all the stories he must have witnessed and experienced. Hovhaness was very familiar with the clarinet and its expressive possibilities (Wolverton, 2002), so it&#8217;s no surprise that this piece captures the melancholy and lament so beautifully.</p>



<p>As I previously stated, the clarinet has the ability to express human emotions, and when effectively crafted, it can feel as though there is a highly varied singer behind this instrument. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll remember this in my upcoming compositions.</p>

<p>One of the composers with whom I most identify is Claude Debussy. So when I stumbled across this piece when researching pentatonic scale melodies, I knew I&#8217;d like it. I was not mistaken.</p>

<p>My primary focus during this analysis will be on melody since that&#8217;s the component of the unit I&#8217;m studying.</p>



<p>This work, written by Claude Debussy between 1909 and 1910 for piano, was later transferred to a variety of other instruments.</p>



<p>The theme is introduced with a simple but lovely melodic line consisting entirely of Gb major pentatonic notes. I find this melody to be interesting because it ascends and descends in the pentatonic scale &#8212; in theory, that may sound boring, but it&#8217;s rather pleasing to listen to in this case.</p>



<p>The theme is then repeated, but instead of going up and down like the first time, we start descending the Gb scale in bar 10. This indicates that the music is going forward and not stuck in the same repetitive pattern, which should be uninteresting.</p>



<p>The work maintains its wave-like melody, but at bar 15, during one of the dramatic ascends, we switch to the Cb major pentatonic scale, reaching the highest note in the piece thus far. The melody then gradually descends in the Gb major scale, with the one quaver &#8211; two semiquavers that are so characteristic of this work, bringing familiarity and tranquillity to the music.</p>



<p>In bar 19, the score states &#8220;Un Peu Animé&#8221;, which I believe is the start of the song&#8217;s climax, where we ascend into three octaves in the scale of Eb Major and reach the highest note so far in the melody.</p>



<p>After the exhilaration of the finale, the primary theme returns, offering familiarity and security once more. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that this theme is a chord-based version of the familiar motif.</p>



<p>It all comes to a halt at bar 28 when the motif returns, but this time an octave higher. This gives the music a lot of tranquillity and a little dreaminess, in my opinion. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re reminiscing about how it all began. It&#8217;s also a little nostalgic.</p>



<p>In bar 33, we repeat bar 14, which brings us to the end of the song. The PP and minims make sure we reach a safe and stable conclusion.</p>



<p>Finally, I was drawn to this music since it is a singable melody that employs simple and common scales. This is the kind of melody I enjoy writing, and I&#8217;m hoping to get some inspiration from Debussy in Assignment 2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C. This song from the eighteenth century piqued my curiosity, so I decided to investigate it more.</p>



<p>The lyrics are as follows, in their literal translation:</p>



<p>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>Sweet-smelling, beautiful, stems full of buds<br>Fragrant and white, everyone praises<br>Let me pluck you down<br>Give to someone else<br>Jasmine flower, oh jasmine flower</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When I first read this score, the slurs between two notes, going one tone up or down, gave it a very pleasant Chinese characteristic sound. It&#8217;s almost like a vocal slide that makes you feel either eager or peaceful depending on which direction you&#8217;re facing.</p>



<p>The song begins with a simple phrase that progresses from E to C, the song&#8217;s highest note, and then down to G. The song proceeds to a calmer section after the repetition of the first phrase, with mostly crochets and note repetition. It eventually descends to C, one octave lower than the highest C.</p>



<p>The last section is when the slur is used more frequently, most likely because the melody shifts from praising the jasmine blossom to taking it up and offering it to someone else. After ascending to the highest C, the song begins to descend to the lowest note, G. I believe the impression of falling down is achieved using this slurs going from E to lower G. It was strikingly beautiful to me.</p>



<p>I then went to Youtube to look for more versions of this song, and I came across this one by the Choir of St John&#8217;s College Cambridge, which I thought was the most fascinating arrangement.</p>

<p>I must confess that, aside from knowing what the pentatonic scale was, I had no idea how important it was in music. I used to think it was a simple scale that was mostly used in nursery rhymes and was used as the first scale a novice learns.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that I was not mistaken, after viewing this incredible video by musician Anuja Kamat, I realized that the pentatonic scale is used all over the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>But why is the pentatonic scale employed by ancient civilizations and people all across the world? Mathematics and frequency are the keys to the solution. Because all notes have a straightforward relationship between them, as illustrated in the points below, all notes sound good. As a result, they appeal to everyone&#8217;s ears.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>tonic has whatever frequency&nbsp;you first chose</li><li>supertonic has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1⅛</li><li>mediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1¼</li><li>dominant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1½</li><li>submediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1⅔</li><li>tonic (octave above) has the frequency of orginal tonic&nbsp;multiplied by 2</li></ul>



<p>The pentatonic scale appears in a variety of musical styles, which is fascinating. In the Chinese folk tune Mo Li Hua, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In the well-known Amazing Grace, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="96" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-300x28.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-768x72.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-640x60.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-960x90.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image.png 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Hold On We&#8217;re Going Home by Drake is another song that uses the pentatonic scale, which is quite prevalent in pop music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="79" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-300x23.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-768x59.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1536x119.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-2048x159.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-640x50.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-960x74.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1.png 2066w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It is also employed by classical composers. Debussy&#8217;s La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin contains another melody based on the pentatonic scale (except for an F).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.teoria.com/res/images/articles/debussy-fille-aux-cheveux-des-lin/tema.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>It makes me wonder whether maybe the pentatonic scale is the so-coveted universal language. A common language shared by people from various places, cultures, and eras. Even if two persons from completely different cultures and musical backgrounds are brought together, they may agree that these five notes sound good. </p>



<p>This Bob McFerrin story exemplifies it perfectly.</p>

<p>Although I still believe the pentatonic scale is a simple scale, I now recognize its significance in music and the vast possibilities it offers. I&#8217;m going to use them in the pentatonic scale melody project I&#8217;m working on.</p>
