		<span>What makes a happy melody?</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>I was listening to music on Spotify on shuffle when Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro came on, and I had a thought: why do I feel happy every time I hear this song, particularly the chorus? I&#8217;ll try to figure it out by examining its melody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>Tim Maia was a Brazilian musician who is regarded as one of the country&#8217;s most influential musicians. Maia pioneered sambalanço with Jorge Ben, a genre that combines samba, soul, funk, and rock and roll.</p>



<p>In 1971, he recorded Não Quero Dinheiro, a samba/soul song in which he declares, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any money, I just want love,&#8221; in response to rising consumerism. It&#8217;s a love song that&#8217;s likely influenced by the peace and love movement of the 1960s. The song went on to become a great success. Note that Brazil was under a dictatorship at the time, and this style of music was used as an escape from oppression.</p>



<p>This song catches my attention because of its general cheerfulness and happiness just by listening to it. This is, in my opinion, to do with repetition, syncopation, and tension.</p>



<p>The song begins with a syncopated melody that is repeated twice before the variation. This is the song&#8217;s verse, and while the tone is lively, it does not reach the climax of the chorus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="247" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-1024x247.png" alt="" class="wp-image-327" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-1024x247.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-300x72.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-768x185.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-1536x370.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-640x154.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-960x231.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10.png 1610w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>First verse of Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro</figcaption></figure>



<p>The chorus is the most joyful element of the song, but Tim Maia&#8217;s creation of a hymn with only three notes is even more astounding. And I believe that repetition is the key. In the first part of the chorus, the A is repeated 32 times.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="238" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1024x238.png" alt="" class="wp-image-328" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1024x238.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-768x178.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1536x357.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-2048x476.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-640x149.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-960x223.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001.png 2187w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>First part of the chorus of <meta charset="utf-8">Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you listen to this melody alone, especially on the piano, you&#8217;ll hear almost a childlike repetition. As if a child was trying to prove she was better than others. It seems like you might be able to sing &#8220;My toy is better than yours&#8221; in this melody.</p>



<p>This chorus is also characterized by tension. The song repeats itself six times, creating tension, with the hope of resolution which comes in half of the seventh bar. The repetition-tension-resolution game continues throughout the entire melody.</p>



<p>I was delighted to discover this Ted Talk about music repetition by Elizabeth Margulis, Professor and Director of Princeton University&#8217;s Music Cognition Lab.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, repetition makes you feel that music is more enjoyable, more interesting and more human. Music critics, according to Margulis, are often embarrassed by repetition, believing it to be childish or regressive; but repetition, far from being embarrassing, helps us to think of music as a way of seeing the world.</p>



<p>Not to be forgotten is Beethoven&#8217;s repeated four-note theme in his Symphony No. 5 or Ravel&#8217;s Bolero, which is composed entirely of variations on a single motif.</p>



<p>Finally, in my opinion, what makes this melody feel happy and cheery is the same childish repetition that reminds you of a period when life was simple and happy, and all you cared about was playing and being happy. And those joyful memories are made up of repeated memories.</p>

		<span>I&#8217;ve learned that I&#8217;ve always liked counterpoint.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>My tutor encouraged me to add research in my log on terminology that I wasn&#8217;t familiar with. So I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;d heard of counterpoint before, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what it meant. Therefore I decided to research it and in the process, I realized I began playing music due to the counterpoint.</p>



<p>To begin with, the basic definition of counterpoint is when at least two melodies are layered one on top of the other (Wood, 1932). Bach&#8217;s two-part Inventions (Taylor, 2012) are an example of such counterpoint:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="865" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-1024x865.png" alt="" class="wp-image-323" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-1024x865.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-300x253.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-768x649.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-640x540.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-960x811.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02.png 1376w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Although there are many examples of counterpoint, canons, and fugues in classical music, I was curious if it was applied in recent popular music.</p>



<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers were one of my favorite bands growing up, mainly because of Flea&#8217;s bass lines. That is why I decided to learn to play the bass. That was counterpoint working on rock music, I had no idea. And counterpoint was the reason I was so captivated with that band.</p>

<p>Queen was another band I grew up admiring, and Freddy Mercury and Brian May were masters of counterpoint. In this Killer Queen example, notice how the guitar and backup vocals occasionally play their own melodies:</p>

<p>I looked into other examples and realized that, while not being a band I normally listen to, Radiohead used a lot of counterpoints in their music, which made me enjoy them far more. For example, just listening to the melody of the trombone in their song Life In A Glasshouse is lovely.</p>

<p>And, since it&#8217;s Friday, here&#8217;s one more example of how the guitar, in addition to the vocal melody and band harmony, plays its own melody. The guitar is isolated in this example because I believe it is simpler to understand the melody of the guitar, and anyone who knows the song can place the voice melody on top without listening to it.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that my reflection on the counterpoint in this piece is superficial, and that thousands of pages have been written about it, but it has helped me to better comprehend the concept and develop it in my future work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The purpose of project 6 is to examine at least two solo wind instrument works from a provided list. It is recommended to keep the following observations in mind:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>the structural desgin</li><li>the melodic contour design</li><li>the scales and the tonality that are explored</li></ul>



<h2 id="jacques-ibert-piece-for-flute-alone" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629787956318 is-style-cnvs-block-section-heading-6 halignleft" >

		<span>Jacques Ibert – Pièce for flute alone</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>This work, written in 1936, was influenced by the movement started by&nbsp;Debussy&#8217;s Syrinx, to&nbsp;write&nbsp;for flute without accompaniment (Lee, 2018). Flute pieces were not very prevalent during the baroque era as solo instrument.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until the instrument&#8217;s development around the turn of the XX&nbsp;century that a large number of flute players emerged and began commissioning new works for the instrument. (Toff,&nbsp;2012). Pièce for solo flute by Jaques Ibert was written for the French flautist Marcel Moyse.</p>

<p>This piece&#8217;s theme appeals to me much. It&#8217;s actually really simple. The supertonic and tonic dotted crochets are followed by six quavers, all in the Db scale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="168" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png" alt="" class="wp-image-267" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png 724w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-640x149.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p>I find this theme particularly appealing because these two notes work together like a sigh. The supertonic represents an inhale and the tonic represents a exhale. Since this piece was written in 1937, between the two great wars, I would say that its motif captures both the hope and disbelief of humanity. Are we going to be at war again? Perhaps not. Inhale. Or most likely, yes. Exhale. After these two notes, there is an answer to the question. Occasionally, they are optimistic and go up (bars 25 and 26), but they are usually pessimistic and go down.</p>



<p>There are 4 parts to this piece: Introduction &#8211; Part A &#8211; Part B &#8211; Part A&#8217;.</p>



<h2 id="introduction" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876025605 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Introduction</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The work begins with a gradual but increasing repetition of D, eventually developing to a quicker sequence of semiquavers and demisemiquavers. This introduction includes a rhythmic portion as well as a wide range of notes that demonstrate the flute&#8217;s tonal diversity. D4 to D6. It culminates in an ascension that leads to the main theme.</p>



<h2 id="part-a" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875870212 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The theme is presented and repeated to establish that this will be a recurring motif in all music and that the listener will remember it. Following that, Ibert interacts with the theme and cadence, frequently ending in surprising notes. It continues until bar 34, when it returns to the original theme but briefly switches to the Gb scale before returning to the D. The question (are we going to be at war?) is left unresolved at the end of this section.</p>



<h2 id="part-b" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876008964 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part B</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Part A is disrupted by this section. It momentarily switches to 9/8 time signature before switching to 3/4 &#8211; 2/4. There&#8217;s also a wave-like tune that conveys some anxiousness and unease. This is also sensed as we transition from a major to a minor scale. It&#8217;s the song&#8217;s most energizing section.</p>



<h2 id="part-a-2" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875998799 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A&#8217;</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>We return to the motif, but this time raised an octave. I believe that the composer needed to bring the listener back to the familiarity of the theme without losing the rush because we just came from such an exciting section. The melody then returns to its original octave, bringing us back home. We keep the sigh, just like we did at the start because the music provides no answers to the initial inquiry. Inhale, then exhale. And the piece ends in Db, which is a semitone below the composition&#8217;s starting note. The Db is repeated in the last bar, but two octaves lower. I don&#8217;t think it contributes anything to the finish and, in my opinion, should be omitted, just as Moyse did in the performance above.</p>



<p>When I started researching for this piece, I discovered that this is one of the most popular pieces among flute students. I&#8217;m beginning to see why. Ibert demonstrates the flute&#8217;s versatility throughout these 5 minutes of music, from trills to rapidly rising and falling scales, to the lovely two notes from the theme that, if performed effectively, can convey the optimism/pessimism duality that I believe the composer was attempting to portray.</p>



<h2 id="alan-hovhaness-lament-for-clarinet" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629880624643 is-style-cnvs-block-section-heading-6 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Alan Hovhaness &#8211; Lament for Clarinet</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Hovhaness was an Armenian-American composer who lived in the United States. Although I can&#8217;t discover a backstory for the Lament for Clarinet (1935), the Armenian exodus is a central motif in his Exile Symphony, which was written a year later (1936). (Athens, 2016). As a result, it&#8217;s plausible to assume that this sombre work was influenced by the Armenian situation in the United States and around the world.</p>

<p>This piece doesn&#8217;t appear to have a rigid structure, except for the main theme in bar 23 that is repeated with variations several times. There is also a motif featured at the beginning of the piece and repeated intermittently throughout.</p>



<p>The main theme consists of a fast rise from F to C, which is then sustained for nearly a full bar. Then there&#8217;s a quaver-crochet pattern that creates the impression that the character is walking or moving, but extremely slowly, as if dragging something, like a great pain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="211" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-1024x211.png" alt="" class="wp-image-276" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-1024x211.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-300x62.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-768x158.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-1536x317.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-640x132.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-960x198.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35.png 1640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The first notes, in my opinion, do an excellent job of portraying the composer&#8217;s grief. It reminds me of Sodade, a song by Cape Verdean singer Cesária Évora. It&#8217;s also a lament for her hometown, which she misses. The chorus&#8217;s initial two notes are a fast rise from G&nbsp;to C, akin to Hovaness&#8217; piece.</p>

<p>This informs me that the clarinet is excellent at resonating with the human voice, which I believe Hovaness was attempting to demonstrate in this piece. The clarinet sings a human grief.</p>



<p>This piece begins with a fast crescendo that demonstrates the clarinet&#8217;s vast range (F3 to C6). Everything slows down after this fast crescendo, with long sustained notes and a bend. I had no idea the clarinet could bend notes, which is fascinating to me. It has a lot of potentials to enhance mourning, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The composer then begins his exploration of the clarinet&#8217;s chalumeau register, with lower pitch notes, which, once again, is an excellent choice for passing the song&#8217;s sadness.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t figure out what scale the composer is using, although the majority of the notes picked sound exotic to me. I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s an Indian scale.</p>



<p>The theme is repeated four times, each time with slight modifications, but always ending on a lower pitch than when it began. It seems to be stating that no matter how hard the character tries to move up, it always ends up going down.</p>



<p>Then, with the reprise of the rising from the song&#8217;s beginning, there&#8217;s a ray of hope. A repetition of bars 19-21,  but again we return to a lower tone as if the character refuses to let go of his or her misery. Several times, hitting&nbsp;the same note, A.</p>



<p>We return to the main theme, always with the sadness of concluding on a lower tone than we began.</p>



<p>Here we begin a dialogue between hope and lament. Hope is a repetition of the preceding fast-rising, but this time it ascends to Db6, the highest note in all music. It&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s our character&#8217;s final hope, followed by a repeat of the first bar. Our character, on the other hand, gives up and plays the same notes for two bars.</p>



<p>Hopes responds by repeating the ascending to the highest tone. However, our character is slowly dying (the composer wrote the morendo in the score), with the semiquavers and crochets gradually fading to the low notes.</p>



<p>This composition struck me as very sad, and I believe that was the composer&#8217;s intention. Probably because of its history and all the stories he must have witnessed and experienced. Hovhaness was very familiar with the clarinet and its expressive possibilities (Wolverton, 2002), so it&#8217;s no surprise that this piece captures the melancholy and lament so beautifully.</p>



<p>As I previously stated, the clarinet has the ability to express human emotions, and when effectively crafted, it can feel as though there is a highly varied singer behind this instrument. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll remember this in my upcoming compositions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the composers with whom I most identify is Claude Debussy. So when I stumbled across this piece when researching pentatonic scale melodies, I knew I&#8217;d like it. I was not mistaken.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>My primary focus during this analysis will be on melody since that&#8217;s the component of the unit I&#8217;m studying.</p>



<p>This work, written by Claude Debussy between 1909 and 1910 for piano, was later transferred to a variety of other instruments.</p>



<p>The theme is introduced with a simple but lovely melodic line consisting entirely of Gb major pentatonic notes. I find this melody to be interesting because it ascends and descends in the pentatonic scale &#8212; in theory, that may sound boring, but it&#8217;s rather pleasing to listen to in this case.</p>



<p>The theme is then repeated, but instead of going up and down like the first time, we start descending the Gb scale in bar 10. This indicates that the music is going forward and not stuck in the same repetitive pattern, which should be uninteresting.</p>



<p>The work maintains its wave-like melody, but at bar 15, during one of the dramatic ascends, we switch to the Cb major pentatonic scale, reaching the highest note in the piece thus far. The melody then gradually descends in the Gb major scale, with the one quaver &#8211; two semiquavers that are so characteristic of this work, bringing familiarity and tranquillity to the music.</p>



<p>In bar 19, the score states &#8220;Un Peu Animé&#8221;, which I believe is the start of the song&#8217;s climax, where we ascend into three octaves in the scale of Eb Major and reach the highest note so far in the melody.</p>



<p>After the exhilaration of the finale, the primary theme returns, offering familiarity and security once more. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that this theme is a chord-based version of the familiar motif.</p>



<p>It all comes to a halt at bar 28 when the motif returns, but this time an octave higher. This gives the music a lot of tranquillity and a little dreaminess, in my opinion. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re reminiscing about how it all began. It&#8217;s also a little nostalgic.</p>



<p>In bar 33, we repeat bar 14, which brings us to the end of the song. The PP and minims make sure we reach a safe and stable conclusion.</p>



<p>Finally, I was drawn to this music since it is a singable melody that employs simple and common scales. This is the kind of melody I enjoy writing, and I&#8217;m hoping to get some inspiration from Debussy in Assignment 2.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C. This song from the eighteenth century piqued my curiosity, so I decided to investigate it more.</p>



<p>The lyrics are as follows, in their literal translation:</p>



<p>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>Sweet-smelling, beautiful, stems full of buds<br>Fragrant and white, everyone praises<br>Let me pluck you down<br>Give to someone else<br>Jasmine flower, oh jasmine flower</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When I first read this score, the slurs between two notes, going one tone up or down, gave it a very pleasant Chinese characteristic sound. It&#8217;s almost like a vocal slide that makes you feel either eager or peaceful depending on which direction you&#8217;re facing.</p>



<p>The song begins with a simple phrase that progresses from E to C, the song&#8217;s highest note, and then down to G. The song proceeds to a calmer section after the repetition of the first phrase, with mostly crochets and note repetition. It eventually descends to C, one octave lower than the highest C.</p>



<p>The last section is when the slur is used more frequently, most likely because the melody shifts from praising the jasmine blossom to taking it up and offering it to someone else. After ascending to the highest C, the song begins to descend to the lowest note, G. I believe the impression of falling down is achieved using this slurs going from E to lower G. It was strikingly beautiful to me.</p>



<p>I then went to Youtube to look for more versions of this song, and I came across this one by the Choir of St John&#8217;s College Cambridge, which I thought was the most fascinating arrangement.</p>

</h2>



<p>I must confess that, aside from knowing what the pentatonic scale was, I had no idea how important it was in music. I used to think it was a simple scale that was mostly used in nursery rhymes and was used as the first scale a novice learns.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that I was not mistaken, after viewing this incredible video by musician Anuja Kamat, I realized that the pentatonic scale is used all over the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>But why is the pentatonic scale employed by ancient civilizations and people all across the world? Mathematics and frequency are the keys to the solution. Because all notes have a straightforward relationship between them, as illustrated in the points below, all notes sound good. As a result, they appeal to everyone&#8217;s ears.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>tonic has whatever frequency&nbsp;you first chose</li><li>supertonic has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1⅛</li><li>mediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1¼</li><li>dominant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1½</li><li>submediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1⅔</li><li>tonic (octave above) has the frequency of orginal tonic&nbsp;multiplied by 2</li></ul>



<p>The pentatonic scale appears in a variety of musical styles, which is fascinating. In the Chinese folk tune Mo Li Hua, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In the well-known Amazing Grace, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="96" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-300x28.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-768x72.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-640x60.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-960x90.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image.png 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Hold On We&#8217;re Going Home by Drake is another song that uses the pentatonic scale, which is quite prevalent in pop music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="79" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-300x23.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-768x59.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1536x119.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-2048x159.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-640x50.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-960x74.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1.png 2066w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It is also employed by classical composers. Debussy&#8217;s La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin contains another melody based on the pentatonic scale (except for an F).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.teoria.com/res/images/articles/debussy-fille-aux-cheveux-des-lin/tema.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>It makes me wonder whether maybe the pentatonic scale is the so-coveted universal language. A common language shared by people from various places, cultures, and eras. Even if two persons from completely different cultures and musical backgrounds are brought together, they may agree that these five notes sound good. </p>



<p>This Bob McFerrin story exemplifies it perfectly.</p>

<p>Although I still believe the pentatonic scale is a simple scale, I now recognize its significance in music and the vast possibilities it offers. I&#8217;m going to use them in the pentatonic scale melody project I&#8217;m working on.</p>

<p>The backstory surrounding the Toccata is fascinating. Carlos Chávez was commissioned by John Cage to create a piece for the percussion ensemble with which he was travelling. As a result, the <meta charset="utf-8">Toccata for Percussion was created. The sad part is that <meta charset="utf-8">Cage&#8217;s ensemble was unable to execute the opening movement, which requires all members to play long, continuous drum rolls, and the piece was never played. The Toccata was not performed until 1948 (Hall, 2008).</p>



<p>The moral of this story, in my opinion, is that there is a fine line between what the composer wants and what the players are capable of playing. In my compositions, I&#8217;ll try to keep this in mind.</p>



<p>This is a three-movement work composed entirely of percussion instruments, the majority of which are unpitched (or indefinite-pitched). I was expecting Latin percussion instruments, but, with the exception of the Indian Drum, all of the other instruments are standard orchestral instruments, not exotic ones.</p>



<p>After a first listen, I discovered that Chávez divided the piece into Membranes and Metalic instruments, with a few wooden instruments thrown in the mix. The wooden instruments, I believe, are used for melody and the other for rhythm.</p>



<p>In terms of the first movement, I found it to be highly interactive. Instruments can be heard playing the passing theme at different times. Other times, as in the example below, the sound shifts from low to high pitch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="448" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-1024x448.png" alt="" class="wp-image-218" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-1024x448.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-300x131.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-768x336.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-1536x671.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-2048x895.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-640x280.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-960x420.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59.png 2558w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This first movement is characterized by the eight notes, that create some of the motifs of this part.</p>



<p>When I got to the end of this movement, I realized it ended the same way it started: with a roll. Actually, rolls are present in all music and may be the Toccata&#8217;s most prominent feature. When I got to the end of the movement, I realized it ended with a roll, just like it had begun.  Because Chávez wrote these final rolls without diminuendo, I believe it will be difficult for players to keep the roll while changing the strength of strokes at the same time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="469" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-1024x469.png" alt="" class="wp-image-220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-1024x469.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-300x138.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-768x352.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-1536x704.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-2048x939.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-640x293.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-960x440.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19.png 2452w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>With the exception of the xylophone, the instruments in the second movement are all metallic. This movement seemed more mysterious to me, perhaps because of the sound of the metallic instruments and the slower tempo. But, thanks to the xylophone and glockenspiel, it&#8217;s also the most melodic of the movements. I found it particularly fascinating when all of the instruments imitated one another, resulting in a unique timbre.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-991x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-219" width="423" height="437" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-991x1024.png 991w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-290x300.png 290w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-768x794.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-300x310.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-640x661.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-960x992.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25.png 1318w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /></figure>



<p>The third movement is more complex, and I finally found the Latin rhythms I was looking for at the beginning. We return to membrane instruments in this movement, with the glockenspiel, maracas, and claves added later. This movement appears to use more sixteenth notes than the previous ones, making it feel faster. The third movement continues to be interactive, with some instruments passing the motif from one instrument to the next, like the example below.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I found the Toccata for Percussion to be a fascinating composition in which I was able to acquire a feel of how different percussion instruments may be used to convey both rhythm and melody.</p>

		<span>Variations, rhythm and all that jazz.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>I listened to all 16 variations from Boris Blacher&#8217;s Variations On A Paganini Theme, but I was curious how it sounded and looked in a concert, so I watched a performance by the Frankfurt Radio Symphony.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>The Paganini Caprice theme fades away after a few seconds, and Blacher&#8217;s variants come to life on their own. There&#8217;s a little resemblance to it now and then, but it&#8217;s really subtle. Another thing I noticed is that Blacher strives to showcase all instruments through the variations, starting with strings, then on to woodwinds, and finally to brass. Percussion continues to come and go as the variants change. Despite the fact that I believe most of the variants to be quite vibrant rhythmically, there is no variation dedicated only to percussion.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a score, and despite the fact that different time signatures were used between variations, I couldn&#8217;t figure out if Variable Metre was used at all.</p>



<p>For me, the second&nbsp;and last two&nbsp;variations were the most intriguing. The second variation features a bluesy oboe with blue notes, which I adore (and it looks like the player from the performance I posted does too). The 15th and 16th have a jazzier flavour to them, and they remind me of big bands. That was a fantastic conclusion. &#8220;Dominant rhythm and abrupt ends are Blacher hallmarks,&#8221; (Simon, 2003) I realized after learning more about Blacher.</p>



<p>All of this jazz influence, and how he changed it into an orchestral sound, piqued my curiosity in Blacher, and I&#8217;m likely to listen to him more in the future, and perhaps include some of his influences into my works.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Side Note about Variations. I had no clue what variations were, let alone how popular Paganini&#8217;s theme was. Basically, variation form is when you take a song&#8217;s theme and investigate, mine, twist, and transform it into a new piece of art (Hough, 2013). It appears to me to be a creative exercise rather than the construction of completely new work. I enjoy the idea of variations, and I&#8217;m curious as to why there aren&#8217;t any big musicians that do variations of other artists&#8217; songs. This reminds me that some DJs are experimenting with several versions of the same song like Stereossauro did with Carlos Paredes&#8217; Verdes Anos.</p>

</h2>



<p>When I was researching the tambourine, I came across Rodion Shchedrin&#8217;s Carmen Suite for string orchestra and percussion (1967). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Bizet / Shchedrin : Carmen Suite" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QysD8zCfGTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption>France Musique, 2020.&nbsp;<em>Bizet / Shchedrin: Carmen Suite</em>.  Available at: &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QysD8zCfGTs&gt; [Accessed 4 July 2021].</figcaption></figure>



<p>A little backstory. When Shchedrin&#8217;s wife, Maya Plisetskaya, asked Shostakovich to write a new Carmen ballet, he &#8220;gently but firmly refused.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of Bizet.&#8221; After that, she asked her husband, who agreed. Shostakovich&#8217;s response demonstrates Shchedrin&#8217;s bravery. After its debut performance, the Carmen Suite was deemed &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; to Bizet&#8217;s opera and was banned by the Soviet leadership. (Plisetskaya, 2001)</p>



<p>I feel that percussion, such as tubular bells, cymbals and castanets, are used throughout Shchedrin&#8217;s score to emphasize rhythms. Although he pays homage to the original material, he frequently pushes the music in unexpected ways, heightening the atmosphere and drama.</p>



<p>On&nbsp;the&nbsp;other&nbsp;side,&nbsp;I&nbsp;find&nbsp;the&nbsp;presence&nbsp;of&nbsp;percussion&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rather&nbsp;comic&nbsp;at&nbsp;times, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;timpani&nbsp;glissando&nbsp;is&nbsp;used&nbsp;or&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;strings&nbsp;provide&nbsp;distinctive&nbsp;effects. </p>



<p>Overall, I think the experiment of using percussion to replace other instruments was a great success, and the end result was quite entertaining. If it&#8217;s superior to the original? I don&#8217;t believe it is necessary to respond.</p>



<p>It reminded me of Johnny Cash&#8217;s Hurt version. It was a risky move for producer Rick Rubin to persuade Johnny Cash to record a version of Nine Inch Nail&#8217;s Hurt. Cash refused to sing the song, which was widely regarded as one of NIN&#8217;s best. It wasn&#8217;t until he read the lyrics that Cash realized he could make his own version of the song. Finally, the singer and producer managed to create a masterpiece from a masterpiece. It wasn&#8217;t better or worse than the original; rather, it was unique. Instead of being a song about drugs and self-destruction, they transformed it into an acoustic song about the epilogue of an eventful life.</p>

<p>Like NIN/Cash&#8217;s Hurt, Bizet/Shchedrin&#8217;s Carmen can exist in the music world indefinitely as two different but interconnected works that don&#8217;t have to be judged against each other.</p>

<p>My&nbsp;first&nbsp;listening&nbsp;log&nbsp;was&nbsp;an&nbsp;assignment&nbsp;in&nbsp;which&nbsp;I&nbsp;was&nbsp;given&nbsp;a&nbsp;list&nbsp;of&nbsp;composers&nbsp;to choose&nbsp;from. I chose Honegger because I have never listened to him before. I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>



<p>I listened to Cello Sonata, H.20 and I was surprised when the III. Presto started. The music starts with a sharp cello that immediately took me to Tango sounds. I was not expecting that. But that feeling lasted for a second because the music immediately takes a rhythm that is nothing like Tango. It goes with a very paced rhythm, almost mechanical, marked by the cello and followed by the piano. Then, is the piano that marks the rhythm. For me, this is done in a very subtle but interesting way. </p>



<p>The music becomes more melodious toward the finish, and it appears that it is becoming calmer, but I believe Honegger is deceiving us. The mechanical rhythm is constant, and the apotheosis is approaching until it abruptly ends. Instead of ending in a D, as you might expect, the cello and piano end a B and a B#, respectively. That was incredible.</p>



<p>Another thing I found fascinating was listening to multiple musicians perform this piece and seeing how they approached the finish in quite different ways. Some clearly marked it, indicating that it had come to an end. Others failed to create the surprise that Honegger envisioned. But, in my perspective, Bertsch and Webber did an excellent job.</p>



<p>One last thought.</p>



<p>Because my mind was still expecting a finish, this finale remained stuck in my thoughts. The&nbsp;thing&nbsp;is,&nbsp;you&#8217;ve&nbsp;been&nbsp;rushing&nbsp;somewhere&nbsp;for&nbsp;more&nbsp;than&nbsp;3&nbsp;minutes,&nbsp;but&nbsp;you&#8217;ve&nbsp;arrived&nbsp;nowhere. Is this song about life? About being born in an instant, living your life at full speed, and having it abruptly end?</p>



<p>That reminds me of the hit tune &#8220;Road to Nowhere&#8221; by Talking Heads. I&#8217;m not suggesting David Byrne was influenced by Honegger, but the mechanically striking snare throughout the song makes you feel like you&#8217;re on your way somewhere. But as David sings, you&#8217;re not. And that is alright.</p>
