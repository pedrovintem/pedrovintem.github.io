		<span>Variations, rhythm and all that jazz.</span>

</h2>



<p>I listened to all 16 variations from Boris Blacher&#8217;s Variations On A Paganini Theme, but I was curious how it sounded and looked in a concert, so I watched a performance by the Frankfurt Radio Symphony.</p>

<p>The Paganini Caprice theme fades away after a few seconds, and Blacher&#8217;s variants come to life on their own. There&#8217;s a little resemblance to it now and then, but it&#8217;s really subtle. Another thing I noticed is that Blacher strives to showcase all instruments through the variations, starting with strings, then on to woodwinds, and finally to brass. Percussion continues to come and go as the variants change. Despite the fact that I believe most of the variants to be quite vibrant rhythmically, there is no variation dedicated only to percussion.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a score, and despite the fact that different time signatures were used between variations, I couldn&#8217;t figure out if Variable Metre was used at all.</p>



<p>For me, the second&nbsp;and last two&nbsp;variations were the most intriguing. The second variation features a bluesy oboe with blue notes, which I adore (and it looks like the player from the performance I posted does too). The 15th and 16th have a jazzier flavour to them, and they remind me of big bands. That was a fantastic conclusion. &#8220;Dominant rhythm and abrupt ends are Blacher hallmarks,&#8221; (Simon, 2003) I realized after learning more about Blacher.</p>



<p>All of this jazz influence, and how he changed it into an orchestral sound, piqued my curiosity in Blacher, and I&#8217;m likely to listen to him more in the future, and perhaps include some of his influences into my works.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Side Note about Variations. I had no clue what variations were, let alone how popular Paganini&#8217;s theme was. Basically, variation form is when you take a song&#8217;s theme and investigate, mine, twist, and transform it into a new piece of art (Hough, 2013). It appears to me to be a creative exercise rather than the construction of completely new work. I enjoy the idea of variations, and I&#8217;m curious as to why there aren&#8217;t any big musicians that do variations of other artists&#8217; songs. This reminds me that some DJs are experimenting with several versions of the same song like Stereossauro did with Carlos Paredes&#8217; Verdes Anos.</p>

<p>When I was researching the tambourine, I came across Rodion Shchedrin&#8217;s Carmen Suite for string orchestra and percussion (1967). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>France Musique, 2020.&nbsp;<em>Bizet / Shchedrin: Carmen Suite</em>.  Available at: &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QysD8zCfGTs&gt; [Accessed 4 July 2021].</figcaption></figure>



<p>A little backstory. When Shchedrin&#8217;s wife, Maya Plisetskaya, asked Shostakovich to write a new Carmen ballet, he &#8220;gently but firmly refused.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of Bizet.&#8221; After that, she asked her husband, who agreed. Shostakovich&#8217;s response demonstrates Shchedrin&#8217;s bravery. After its debut performance, the Carmen Suite was deemed &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; to Bizet&#8217;s opera and was banned by the Soviet leadership. (Plisetskaya, 2001)</p>



<p>I feel that percussion, such as tubular bells, cymbals and castanets, are used throughout Shchedrin&#8217;s score to emphasize rhythms. Although he pays homage to the original material, he frequently pushes the music in unexpected ways, heightening the atmosphere and drama.</p>



<p>On&nbsp;the&nbsp;other&nbsp;side,&nbsp;I&nbsp;find&nbsp;the&nbsp;presence&nbsp;of&nbsp;percussion&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rather&nbsp;comic&nbsp;at&nbsp;times, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;timpani&nbsp;glissando&nbsp;is&nbsp;used&nbsp;or&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;strings&nbsp;provide&nbsp;distinctive&nbsp;effects. </p>



<p>Overall, I think the experiment of using percussion to replace other instruments was a great success, and the end result was quite entertaining. If it&#8217;s superior to the original? I don&#8217;t believe it is necessary to respond.</p>



<p>It reminded me of Johnny Cash&#8217;s Hurt version. It was a risky move for producer Rick Rubin to persuade Johnny Cash to record a version of Nine Inch Nail&#8217;s Hurt. Cash refused to sing the song, which was widely regarded as one of NIN&#8217;s best. It wasn&#8217;t until he read the lyrics that Cash realized he could make his own version of the song. Finally, the singer and producer managed to create a masterpiece from a masterpiece. It wasn&#8217;t better or worse than the original; rather, it was unique. Instead of being a song about drugs and self-destruction, they transformed it into an acoustic song about the epilogue of an eventful life.</p>

<p>Like NIN/Cash&#8217;s Hurt, Bizet/Shchedrin&#8217;s Carmen can exist in the music world indefinitely as two different but interconnected works that don&#8217;t have to be judged against each other.</p>

<p>My&nbsp;first&nbsp;listening&nbsp;log&nbsp;was&nbsp;an&nbsp;assignment&nbsp;in&nbsp;which&nbsp;I&nbsp;was&nbsp;given&nbsp;a&nbsp;list&nbsp;of&nbsp;composers&nbsp;to choose&nbsp;from. I chose Honegger because I have never listened to him before. I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>



<p>I listened to Cello Sonata, H.20 and I was surprised when the III. Presto started. The music starts with a sharp cello that immediately took me to Tango sounds. I was not expecting that. But that feeling lasted for a second because the music immediately takes a rhythm that is nothing like Tango. It goes with a very paced rhythm, almost mechanical, marked by the cello and followed by the piano. Then, is the piano that marks the rhythm. For me, this is done in a very subtle but interesting way. </p>



<p>The music becomes more melodious toward the finish, and it appears that it is becoming calmer, but I believe Honegger is deceiving us. The mechanical rhythm is constant, and the apotheosis is approaching until it abruptly ends. Instead of ending in a D, as you might expect, the cello and piano end a B and a B#, respectively. That was incredible.</p>



<p>Another thing I found fascinating was listening to multiple musicians perform this piece and seeing how they approached the finish in quite different ways. Some clearly marked it, indicating that it had come to an end. Others failed to create the surprise that Honegger envisioned. But, in my perspective, Bertsch and Webber did an excellent job.</p>



<p>One last thought.</p>



<p>Because my mind was still expecting a finish, this finale remained stuck in my thoughts. The&nbsp;thing&nbsp;is,&nbsp;you&#8217;ve&nbsp;been&nbsp;rushing&nbsp;somewhere&nbsp;for&nbsp;more&nbsp;than&nbsp;3&nbsp;minutes,&nbsp;but&nbsp;you&#8217;ve&nbsp;arrived&nbsp;nowhere. Is this song about life? About being born in an instant, living your life at full speed, and having it abruptly end?</p>



<p>That reminds me of the hit tune &#8220;Road to Nowhere&#8221; by Talking Heads. I&#8217;m not suggesting David Byrne was influenced by Honegger, but the mechanically striking snare throughout the song makes you feel like you&#8217;re on your way somewhere. But as David sings, you&#8217;re not. And that is alright.</p>
