<p>To enhance my essay, my tutor suggested that in part 1, a more substantial analysis of Palestrina&#8217;s work with a detailed description of his stylistic resources.</p>



<p>Regarding part 2, my tutor emphasized the importance of writing piece names in italics and advised me to improve my prose by making it more analytical and academic. Additionally, my tutor suggested that I could provide further context about Vivaldi&#8217;s piece and strengthen my arguments by referencing musical scores.</p>

<p>This assignment compares the Missa Brevis by two composers, Palestrina and Zoltán Kodály. Additionally, it examines Max Richter&#8217;s reinterpretation of Vivaldi&#8217;s Four Seasons in his work, Vivaldi Recomposed.</p>



<h5 id="part-1" class="wp-block-heading">Part 1</h5>



<p>To compare the Missa Brevis by Palestrina and Zoltán Kodály, I listened to The Tallis Scholars&#8217; recording of Palestrina&#8217;s Mass, directed by Peter Phillips, and to the Warsaw Philharmonic Choir&#8217;s performance of Kodály&#8217;s Mass directed by Bartosz Michałowski.</p>



<p>Palestrina&#8217;s Missa Brevis, with a duration of around 20 minutes, was published in 1570 (Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, no date). The piece was composed for four voices, with exceptions in the Benedictus (three voices) and the second Agnus Dei (five voices). The melodic lines are given prominence, gracefully ascending and descending in a controlled manner. As Jeppesen (2005:50) observes, this controlled melodic movement is characteristic of Palestrina&#8217;s style. The independent melodic lines intertwine seamlessly while maintaining clarity and balance. This emphasis on melody, coupled with the predominantly stepwise motion and restricted melodic range within sections, contributes to a restrain of passionate momentum as Jeppesen (2005:51) describes it.</p>

<p>Imitation serves as another stylistic device throughout Missa Brevis. As seen in Fig. 2, melodic phrases are introduced in one voice and subsequently echoed or elaborated upon by other voices, creating a sense of unity and interconnectedness within the polyphonic texture.</p>

<p>Rhythmically, Missa Brevis aligns with Palestrina&#8217;s characteristic style, which Boyd (1973:11) describes as &#8220;unadventurous.&#8221; The rhythmic patterns remain relatively stable and predictable.</p>



<p>Kodály&#8217;s Missa Brevis for solo voices, chorus, and organ, was composed during World War II (1942-44), reflecting a contrasting world. It is imbued with significance, having premiered in the cloakroom of Budapest&#8217;s Opera House. Subtitled “in tempore belli” (“in times of war”), it was written, at least in part, during the Budapest siege. This sense of despair is infused in the composition through the use of dissonances and the interaction between the voices. Kodály&#8217;s Missa Brevis is more outward-looking, with a sense of energy and drama that contrasts with Palestrina&#8217;s introspective nature. It also distances itself from Palestrina&#8217;s Mass by incorporating more rhythmic vitality (Fig. 3) and increasing the melodic range going to the extremes of the registers (Fig.4).</p>

<p>In terms of tonality, it is centred on D and its structure forms an arch, a nineteenth-century structural principle (Pickar, 1985), with extensive use of thematic transformation: for example, the Adagio ‘Qui tollis’ from the Gloria returns at the start of the Agnus Dei; a variation of the entire Kyrie is employed for the ‘Dona nobis pacem’.  In terms of cadences, they feel less predictable compared to those found in Palestrina&#8217;s composition.</p>



<p>Despite their stylistic differences, both composers share a common core. They adhere to the traditional structure of the Mass Ordinary, comprising sections like Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Benedictus, and Agnus Dei, although Kodály adds an introductory section (Introitus) and a final section (Ite, Missa Est). They also employ the traditional Latin text of the Mass.</p>



<p>Being passionate about WWII history, Kodály&#8217;s Mass naturally feels more interesting to me. Its historical importance attracted me right away, but so did the sound of it. It feels more explorative than Palestrina&#8217;s, even while following an established structure. The beginning of Gloria is a great example of unexpected fanfare-like figures. The interaction between the voices, almost like a dialogue, appeals to me more. The dramatic dynamic changes, the use of extreme vocal ranges, the use of dissonance, and the unexpected cadences (Fig. 5) also draw me toward Kodály&#8217;s Mass.</p>

<p><em>Vivaldi Recomposed</em> is a piece composed by Max Richter in 2011, where he proposed to pick up the essence of Vivaldi’s <em>Four Seasons</em> and imbue it with a contemporary sound (Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons recomposed by Max Richter [Streaming], 2014). But rather than merely rearranging Vivaldi’s composition to mirror the modern aesthetic, Richter deconstructs the original piece. He isolates its fundamental elements—themes, harmonies, and rhythms—and reassembles them, allowing the work to resonate deeply with today’s audiences. This analysis examines the Winter Concerto to understand how Richter creates a fresh sound while using earlier material.</p>



<p>Before looking into the piece, it’s crucial to understand that Richter, like any composer, did not create in isolation. His work is a product of the 21st-century context. This implies that both he and his audience are familiar with Vivaldi’s <em>Four Seasons</em> since it is one of the most popular classical pieces in the world. Moreover, composers who emerged after Vivaldi introduced new techniques and sounds, influencing Richter’s compositions.</p>



<p>This influence is evident in the first segment of <em>Winter 1</em>. The first 22 bars mirror exactly Vivaldi’s <em>Winter First Movement</em>. However, Richter introduces a new technique. He instructs all the strings to use Ponticello, see Fig. 1, generating a shivering and harsh sound. While Ponticello was used occasionally in the Baroque period, it was only during the Romantic Period that Ponticello evolved into a significant expressive tool, rather than merely a unique sound effect (Greenfield, 2017). The effect is particularly pronounced in the solo violin, which produces a sound that is significantly colder and more glass-like than Vivaldi’s.</p>

Bars 1-4)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Richter’s usage of dynamics also diverges from Vivaldi’s. Where Vivaldi maintains a constant mezzo-forte until the crescendo for a forte before the main theme, Richter engages in a dynamic fluctuation, repeatedly crescendo from pianissimo to mezzo-forte or forte, see Fig. 2, before each solo violin melody. This manipulation of dynamics enhances the overall texture and emotional depth of the piece, underpinning Richter’s vision.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most thrilling aspect of Richter&#8217;s <em>Winter 1 </em>is his approach to reconfiguring Vivaldi’s most recognisable passage of the movement. Richter decided to extract a beat from the main theme, transitioning from a 4/4 to a 7/16 time signature, see Fig. 3. This imparts an unexpected sound to a familiar part of the music. It renders the music rapid, restless, and somewhat sloppy, perhaps conveying the sensation of someone running on ice and occasionally slipping.</p>

<p>The rest of the first movement repeats this progression and rhythm until the end. The constant repetition of Vivaldi&#8217;s selected material is a hallmark of Richter&#8217;s recomposition, which one can understand comes from his minimalistic roots. Or perhaps it is so the work is more appealing to modern ears. In this case, in particular, he repeats the chord progression that moves in 4ths, see Fig. 4. (which Vivaldi already used). This is a progression that has been extensively used in modern pop music, and the repetition likely satisfies the sensibilities of contemporary audiences.</p>

<p>The second movement, <em>Winter 2</em>, is impressive in its simplicity and coldness. Here, Richter utilizes two of Vivaldi&#8217;s original materials &#8211; the melody, which is almost the same as the original except for some additional tremolos and brief skipping of notes (see Fig. 5), and the drone of the viola, which he multiplies across all the strings. This seems a Richter stylistic trace, reminiscent of his piece <em>A Sudden Manhattan of the Mind,</em> where a drone harmony (played by synths in this case) creates a soundscape for the violin to display its melody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="214" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/05/untitled-1024x214.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2024" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/05/untitled-1024x214.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/05/untitled-300x63.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/05/untitled-768x160.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/05/untitled-1536x321.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/05/untitled-2048x428.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/05/untitled-640x134.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/05/untitled-960x201.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/05/untitled.png 2192w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig. 5. Example of comparison of Vivaldi&#8217;s melody (on top) and Richter&#8217;s melody (bottom)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The harmonic inaction evokes a sensation of stillness, coldness, and sadness, which contrasts with Vivaldi&#8217;s familiar and warm harmonic progression, from the tonic to the dominant, with a modulation to the dominant and an expected return to Eb major. This is perhaps the most impressive feature of Richter&#8217;s recomposition &#8211; using almost identical material (in this case, the melody and drone) to convey a completely different, and in fact, opposing emotional experience.</p>



<p>Allowing for an almost static harmony gives solo performers significant creative expression, particularly in live performances, where the tempo can be stretched or reduced without impacting the accompaniment. This aspect hints at Richter’s dedication to continue Vivaldi’s legacy of showcasing musical virtuosity.</p>



<p>In <em>Winter 3</em> there’s Richter&#8217;s signature style of stability, defined by Ross (2023), when he writes “Richter’s pieces usually wind up not far from where they began”. This movement evokes a sense of a vast, seemingly unchanging landscape, subtly layered with the introduction of individual elements, one at a time, without any dramatic harmonic or rhythmic shifts. This aligns perfectly with Szabo&#8217;s definition of minimalism: &#8220;uniform, predictable, and understated music; lacking in abrupt changes of instrumentation or volume, devoid of harmonic or rhythmic surprises&#8221; (Ross, 2023). Here, Richter unquestionably embraces a minimalist approach to Vivaldi’s material.</p>



<p>He steers away from Vivaldi&#8217;s programme, which evokes the sensation of walking on ice, creating an enigmatic soundscape that feels perpetually unsettled. While a subtle programmatic hint lingers through the repeated descending scales in the violas, in red in Fig. 6, suggesting a sensation of constant falling, the solo violin&#8217;s sequence (green) and contrabass drone (blue) establish an ethereal atmosphere that defies a strictly programmatic interpretation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="411" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-1024x411.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1984" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-1024x411.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-300x120.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-768x308.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-1536x617.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-2048x822.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-640x257.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-960x385.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57.png 3024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig. 6 (Max Richter&#8217; Vivaldi Recomposed: Winter 3.

<p>Another noteworthy distinction is Richter&#8217;s omission of the unexpected pauses and changes of mood employed by Vivaldi in his third movement, where he conveys the suspense of slipping and falling on ice. Here, the rhythm persists uniformly throughout, further emphasising the minimalist avoidance of rhythmic surprises.</p>



<p>The ending of the movement fades out rather than resolving with a definitive cadence, a technique prevalent in many popular songs, particularly those from the latter half of the 20th century (Weir, 2014). This is particularly intriguing for a piece&#8217;s final resolution. One traditionally anticipates a conclusive ending, mirroring Vivaldi&#8217;s approach. Here, however, Richter offers a gentle, introspective, and open-ended conclusion.</p>



<p>Upon revisiting <em>Vivaldi Recomposed</em>, it becomes evident that Richter&#8217;s process involved more than simply layering new material upon Vivaldi&#8217;s foundation. Notably, Richter introduces no entirely new melodies. Instead, he employs a technique of repetition, similar to looping and sampling – a decidedly modern soundscape. Through this approach, Richter creates a piece that bridges the centuries, fostering a dialogue between an old work and the present day. This strategy allows Richter to both preserve and redefine Vivaldi&#8217;s composition, ensuring its continued relevance and connection with contemporary audiences.</p>

<p>The Renaissance and Baroque eras are not my favorite musical periods. While I recognise their importance to music history, the complexity of the contrapuntal music and the strict adherence to forms are two aspects that put me off. However, I found it extremely useful to gain knowledge of forms, instruments, techniques and composers of these eras.</p>



<p>One particular sound that doesn’t appeal to me in these periods is sacred music, especially because of its stillness, slow rhythms, and the echoing polyphony of the voices. I&#8217;ve tried to listen to several pieces, and this unit was helpful in that regard as well, but I still struggle to find pleasure in listening to them. That was until I listened to Kodály’s Missa Brevis. That was a real pleasure to listen to. Although it had the same slowness of a Renaissance style, it had a lot of dissonance that I felt adds a lot more drama and spice.</p>



<p>Reflecting and researching dissonance was interesting to the point that I’ve been much more drawn to dissonant sounds since I started my degree than ever before. I now appreciate dissonance as a spice in food. Too much can distract from the main flavours (meaning harmony and melody), but too little can make it bland and predictable. In the case of Kodály’s Missa Brevis, I felt that the dissonances were just right in making serene music sound more dramatic.</p>



<p>I feel that this unit’s assignment was when I explored more of one of the things I love most about the arts, and music in particular. I love to explore how modern artists are influenced by past artists, especially in popular music. I find a special pleasure in identifying little influences in modern compositions that can relate directly to previous artists and understanding how contemporary artists add to that. But to do this, it&#8217;s better to have a deep understanding of music history as a whole, and that’s how I found this unit to be so useful.</p>



<p>Reflecting and understanding musical patronage was another topic I found very interesting in this unit. I find it especially important right now, in a moment when there’s a big discussion about payment models for artists, since streaming services pay so little and music publishers seem to favor those artists who are profitable in terms of live music. This leaves emerging artists out of the way to have financial support to pursue their music.</p>



<p>Although I like the historical and theoretical part of music, I miss composition a lot. I believe that this unit, and this course in general, would benefit from having a strong mix of theory and practical composition throughout the units.</p>



<p>I end this unit still mixing up a little between the eras. It’s much easier and intuitive for me to discern between Classical and Romantic than it is to discern Classical from Baroque and Renaissance. I believe I should work more on this in future units during my degree.</p>



<p>Overall, this unit helped a lot to contextualise music historically and idiomatically, although I believe I need further studying in order to gain a deep understanding of each musical era.</p>

<p>This assignment compares the Missa Brevis by two composers, Palestrina and Zoltán Kodály. Additionally, it examines Max Richter&#8217;s reinterpretation of Vivaldi&#8217;s Four Seasons in his work, Vivaldi Recomposed.</p>



<h5 id="part-1" class="wp-block-heading">Part 1</h5>



<p>To compare the Missa Brevis by Palestrina and Zoltán Kodály, I listened to The Tallis Scholars&#8217; recording of Palestrina&#8217;s Mass, directed by Peter Phillips, and to the Warsaw Philharmonic Choir&#8217;s performance of Kodály&#8217;s Mass directed by Bartosz Michałowski.</p>



<p>Palestrina&#8217;s Missa Brevis exemplifies the Renaissance style. Composed for four voices sometime in the mid-16th century, it adheres to the principles of counterpoint, with melodic lines weaving together seamlessly. The focus is on vocal clarity and a sense of serenity. Palestrina&#8217;s textures are predominantly smooth, with a balance between polyphony and homophony, usually manifesting at the final cadence. The overall effect is one of meditative beauty, drawing the listener into a realm of introspection. Palestrina&#8217;s works were typically performed with no accompaniment in large, resonant spaces, allowing the polyphonic textures to blend and create a sense of reverence and spaciousness.</p>



<p>Kodály&#8217;s Missa Brevis for solo voices, chorus, and organ, was composed during World War II (1942-44), reflecting a contrasting world. It is imbued with significance, having premiered in the cloakroom of Budapest&#8217;s Opera House. Subtitled “in tempore belli” (“in times of war”), it was written, at least in part, during the Budapest siege. This sense of despair is infused in the composition through the use of dissonances and the interaction between the voices. Kodály&#8217;s Missa Brevis is more outward-looking, with a sense of energy and drama that contrasts with Palestrina&#8217;s introspective nature. It also distances itself from Palestrina&#8217;s Mass by incorporating more rhythmic vitality and a greater emphasis on the expressive potential of the human voice.</p>



<p>In terms of tonality, it is centred on D and its structure forms an arch, a nineteenth-century structural principle (Pickar, 1985), with extensive use of thematic transformation: the Adagio ‘Qui tollis’ from the Gloria returns at the start of the Agnus Dei. A variation of the entire Kyrie is employed for the ‘Dona nobis pacem’. The cadences feel more unexpected than those found in Palestrina&#8217;s compositions.</p>



<p>Despite their stylistic differences, both composers share a common core. They adhere to the traditional structure of the Mass Ordinary, comprising sections like Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Benedictus, and Agnus Dei, although Kodály adds an introductory section (Introitus) and a final section (Ite, Missa Est). They also employ the traditional Latin text of the Mass. Kodály&#8217;s Missa Brevis features plainchant-style melodies similar to Palestrina but mixed with modal keys reminiscent of the Hungarian folk tradition.</p>



<p>Being passionate about WWII history, Kodály&#8217;s Mass naturally feels more interesting to me. Its historical importance attracted me right away, but so did the sound of it. It feels more explorative than Palestrina&#8217;s, even while following an established structure. The beginning of Gloria is a great example of unexpected fanfare-like figures. The interaction between the voices, almost like a dialogue, appeals to me more. The drama, the use of dissonance, and the unexpected cadences also draw me toward Kodály&#8217;s Mass.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I feel that Kodaly&#8217;s Mass is rooted in tonality and isn&#8217;t as challenging to the ear as other contemporary musical pieces, such as Bartók&#8217;s. This made me appreciate the music more. Perhaps it was Kodaly&#8217;s background as a music educator that led him to make a more accessible Mass, or maybe he aimed to create a Mass that would reach a broader audience and bring peace and hope in a post-war setting.&#8221;</p>

<h5 id="part-2" class="wp-block-heading">Part 2</h5>



<p>Vivaldi Recomposed is a piece composed by Max Richter in 2011, where he proposed to pick up the essence of Vivaldi’s Four Seasons and imbue it with a contemporary sound (Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons recomposed by Max Richter [Streaming], 2014). But rather than merely rearranging Vivaldi’s composition to mirror the modern aesthetic, Richter deconstructs the original piece. He isolates its fundamental elements—themes, harmonies, and rhythms—and reassembles them, allowing the work to resonate deeply with today’s audiences. This analysis examines the Winter Concerto to understand how Richter creates a fresh sound while using earlier material.</p>



<p>Before looking into the piece, it’s crucial to understand that Richter, like any composer, did not create in isolation. His work is a product of the 21st-century context. This implies that both he and his audience are familiar with Vivaldi’s Four Seasons since it is one of the most popular classical pieces in the world. Moreover, composers who emerged after Vivaldi introduced new techniques and sounds, influencing Richter’s compositions.</p>



<p>This influence is evident in the first segment of Winter 1. The first 22 bars mirror exactly Vivaldi’s Winter First Movement. However, Richter introduces a new technique. He instructs all the strings to use Ponticello, see Fig. 1, generating a shivering and harsh sound. While Ponticello was used occasionally in the Baroque period, it was only during the Romantic Period that Ponticello evolved into a significant expressive tool, rather than merely a unique sound effect (Greenfield, 2017). The effect is particularly pronounced in the solo violin, which produces a sound that is significantly colder and more glass-like than Vivaldi’s.</p>

Bars 1-4)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Richter’s usage of dynamics also diverges from Vivaldi’s. Where Vivaldi maintains a constant mezzo-forte until the crescendo for a forte before the main them, Richter engages in a dynamic fluctuation, repeatedly crescendo from pianissimo to mezzo-forte or forte, see Fig. 2, before each of solo violin line. This manipulation of dynamics enhances the overall texture and emotional depth of the piece, underpinning Richter’s vision.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most thrilling aspect of Richter&#8217;s Winter 1 is his approach to reconfiguring Vivaldi’s most recognisable passage of the movement. Richter decided to extract a beat from the main theme, transitioning from a 4/4 to a 7/16 time signature, see Fig. 3. This imparts an unexpected sound to a familiar part of the music. It renders the music rapid, restless, and somewhat sloppy, effectively conveying the sensation of someone running on ice and occasionally slipping.</p>

<p>The rest of the first movement repeats this progression and rhythm until the end. The constant repetition of Vivaldi&#8217;s selected material is a hallmark of Richter&#8217;s recomposition, which one can understand comes from his minimalistic roots. Or perhaps it is so the work is more appealing to modern ears. In this case, in particular, he repeats the chord progression that moves in 4ths, see Fig 4. (which Vivaldi already used). This is a progression that has been extensively used in modern pop music, and the repetition likely satisfies the sensibilities of contemporary audiences.</p>

Bars 39-46)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The second movement, &#8220;Winter 2,&#8221; is impressive in its simplicity and coldness. Here, Richter utilizes two of Vivaldi&#8217;s original materials &#8211; the melody, which is almost the same as the original except for some additional tremolos and brief skipping of notes, and the drone of the viola, which he multiplies across all the strings. This seems a Richter stylistic trace, reminiscent of his piece &#8220;A Sudden Manhattan of the Mind,&#8221; where a drone harmony (played by synths in this case) creates a soundscape for the violin to display its melody.</p>



<p>The harmonic inaction evokes a sensation of stillness, coldness, and sadness, which contrasts with Vivaldi&#8217;s programmatic feeling of pleasure in getting warm inside through a crackling fire. This is perhaps the most impressive feature of Richter&#8217;s recomposition &#8211; using almost identical material (in this case, the melody and drone) to convey a completely different, and in fact, opposing emotional experience.</p>



<p>Allowing for an almost static harmony gives solo performers significant creative expression, particularly in live performances, where the tempo can be stretched or reduced without impacting the accompaniment. This aspect hints at Richter’s dedication to continue Vivaldi’s legacy of showcasing musical virtuosity.</p>



<p>In Winter 3 there’s Richter&#8217;s signature style of stability, defined by Ross (2023), when he writes “Richter’s pieces usually wind up not far from where they began”. This movement evokes a sense of a vast, seemingly unchanging landscape, subtly layered with the introduction of individual elements, one at a time, without any dramatic harmonic or rhythmic shifts. This aligns perfectly with Szabo&#8217;s definition of minimalism: &#8220;uniform, predictable, and understated music; lacking in abrupt changes of instrumentation or volume, devoid of harmonic or rhythmic surprises&#8221; (Ross, 2023). Here, Richter unquestionably embraces a minimalist approach to Vivaldi’s material.</p>



<p>He steers away from Vivaldi&#8217;s programmatic movement, creating an enigmatic soundscape that feels perpetually unsettled. While a subtle programmatic hint lingers through the repeated descending scales in the violas, in red in Fig. 5, suggesting a sensation of constant falling, the solo violin&#8217;s unending ostinatos (green) and contrabass drone (blue) establish an ethereal atmosphere that defies a strictly programmatic interpretation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="411" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-1024x411.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1984" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-1024x411.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-300x120.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-768x308.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-1536x617.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-2048x822.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-640x257.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-960x385.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57.png 3024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig 4 (Max Richter&#8217; Vivaldi Recomposed: Winter 3. Bars 49-60)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another noteworthy distinction is Richter&#8217;s omission of the unexpected pauses and changes of mood employed by Vivaldi in his third movement. Here, the rhythm persists uniformly throughout, further emphasising the minimalist avoidance of rhythmic surprises.</p>



<p>The ending of the movement fades out rather than resolving with a definitive cadence, a technique prevalent in many popular songs, particularly those from the latter half of the 20th century (Weir, 2014). This is particularly intriguing for a piece&#8217;s final resolution. One traditionally anticipates a conclusive ending, mirroring Vivaldi&#8217;s approach. Here, however, Richter offers a gentle, introspective, and open-ended conclusion.</p>



<p>Upon revisiting Vivaldi Recomposed, it becomes evident that Richter&#8217;s process involved more than simply layering new material upon Vivaldi&#8217;s foundation. Notably, Richter introduces no entirely new melodies. Instead, he employs a technique of repetition, similar to looping and sampling – a decidedly modern soundscape. Through this approach, Richter creates a piece that bridges the centuries, fostering a dialogue between an old work and the present day. This strategy allows Richter to both preserve and redefine Vivaldi&#8217;s composition, ensuring its continued relevance and connection with contemporary audiences.</p>

<p>The Renaissance and Baroque eras are not my favorite musical periods. While I recognise their importance to music history, the complexity of the contrapuntal music and the strict adherence to forms are two aspects that put me off. However, I found it extremely useful to gain knowledge of forms, instruments, techniques and composers of these eras.</p>



<p>One particular sound that doesn’t appeal to me in these periods is sacred music, especially because of its stillness, slow rhythms, and the echoing polyphony of the voices. I&#8217;ve tried to listen to several pieces, and this unit was helpful in that regard as well, but I still struggle to find pleasure in listening to them. That was until I listened to Kodály’s Missa Brevis. That was a real pleasure to listen to. Although it had the same slowness of a Renaissance style, it had a lot of dissonance that I felt adds a lot more drama and spice.</p>



<p>Reflecting and researching dissonance was interesting to the point that I’ve been much more drawn to dissonant sounds since I started my degree than ever before. I now appreciate dissonance as a spice in food. Too much can distract from the main flavours (meaning harmony and melody), but too little can make it bland and predictable. In the case of Kodály’s Missa Brevis, I felt that the dissonances were just right in making serene music sound more dramatic.</p>



<p>I feel that this unit’s assignment was when I explored more of one of the things I love most about the arts, and music in particular. I love to explore how modern artists are influenced by past artists, especially in popular music. I find a special pleasure in identifying little influences in modern compositions that can relate directly to previous artists and understanding how contemporary artists add to that. But to do this, it&#8217;s better to have a deep understanding of music history as a whole, and that’s how I found this unit to be so useful.</p>



<p>Reflecting and understanding musical patronage was another topic I found very interesting in this unit. I find it especially important right now, in a moment when there’s a big discussion about payment models for artists, since streaming services pay so little and music publishers seem to favor those artists who are profitable in terms of live music. This leaves emerging artists out of the way to have financial support to pursue their music.</p>



<p>Although I like the historical and theoretical part of music, I miss composition a lot. I believe that this unit, and this course in general, would benefit from having a strong mix of theory and practical composition throughout the units.</p>



<p>I end this unit still mixing up a little between the eras. It’s much easier and intuitive for me to discern between Classical and Romantic than it is to discern Classical from Baroque and Renaissance. I believe I should work more on this in future units during my degree.</p>



<p>Overall, this unit helped a lot to contextualise music historically and idiomatically, although I believe I need further studying in order to gain a deep understanding of each musical era.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>By my tutor&#8217;s suggestion, I heard the work Wendy Carlos did with the Clockwork Orange soundtrack and was amazed by the mixture of classical and electronic music, especially with Beethoven&#8217;s 9th symphony.</p>



<p>From my research, Carlos was one of the pioneers of synthesizers, working with Robert Moog to develop the famous Moog synthesizer. She launched the hugely controversial Switched-on Bach album with music by Bach performed on a Moog synthesizer. Later, she continued combining synthesized and classical music, and she combined Beethoven&#8217;s 9th Symphony with a new hardware that converted the human voice into electronic signals and would later be famously known as a vocoder.</p>



<p>This is the work that ended up in Clockwork Orange&#8217;s soundtrack and has an important role in it. Beethoven&#8217;s music works as a leitmotif for the main character, Alex, and violence. In the beginning, the music is acoustic, but after Alex&#8217;s shock therapy, the music is synthesized. The effect on the listener is quite radical and direct. What was once familiar, rooted in the past, and established, turns into a weird, futuristic, and almost childish sound. The vocoder works perfectly into making the famous choir turn into robots, which can be seen as a direct relation to what happens on screen: the deviant character is forced into normalcy.</p>



<p>Musically speaking, I really enjoyed listening to it. The sound sounds fresh even though it was composed in 1972, but that&#8217;s no surprise because synthesizers and vocoders are more and more common in contemporary music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I heard this piece when trying to find pieces for the assignment. Although I would love to explore it in a deeper level, I didn&#8217;t find it fit the assignment context. Nevertheless, I listened to it several times, and found that it&#8217;s filled with romantic composers influences.</p>



<p>Muse, and especially its main composer, Matt Bellamy, are a contemporary rock band that is self-admittedly influenced by classical music. One can find direct usage of music from previous eras such as Palestrina&#8217;s Sanctus and Benedictus rearrangement in the music Drones; Saint-Saëns&#8217;s Mon cœur s&#8217;ouvre à ta voix in I Belong to You; and Tchaikovsky&#8217;s &#8216;Piano Concerto No.1: Allegro Non Troppo E Molto Maestoso in Hoodoo. But there are far more examples of direct influence such as Bach&#8217;s toccatas in Plug In Baby, The Handler and In Your World;</p>



<p>Exogenesis: Symphony is divided into three movements entitled &#8220;Overture&#8221;, &#8220;Cross-Pollination&#8221; and &#8220;Redemption, and has a programmatic story of humanity coming to an end and everyone pinning their hopes on a group of astronauts who go out to explore space and spread humanity to another planet. Matt Bellamy, the composer, said that this composition was &#8220;influenced by Rachmaninov, Strauss, Chopin and Pink Floyd.&#8221;</p>



<p>Right from the beginning of the piece, I can find similarities with Wagner&#8217;s The Rhinegold prelude. The floating arpeggios building up on top of a drone bass, creating a long and slow build up and setting the mood, made it look like at least the composer used the same style as Wagner&#8217;s. This establishes the beginning of the programme of humanity coming to an end.</p>



<p>When Bellamy&#8217;s voice enters, it is with a long falsetto that is not common in rock music. The several repeated questions that the lyrics present, go very well with the repetition of the arpeggios.</p>



<p>The second movement starts with only a piano playing a chromatic introduction that resembles Chopin&#8217;s Etude n°10 opus 25. The next part resembles Liszt&#8217;s Transcendental Etude No.5, Feux Follets. But another quick change in mood brings an accompaniment that sounds again like Chopin, in this case, his Nocturne op.9 n°2 in E flat Major.</p>



<p>The beginning of the third movement has a straightforward feeling of Beethoven&#8217;s Piano Sonata No. 14, mostly because of its triplets arpeggios, but for me it brought to mind the melody of Liszt&#8217;s Liebestraum No. 3 in the insisting high note.</p>



<p>Overall, I really liked this song, although it&#8217;s not my favourite from Muse, I like how they were able to mix classical influences in a somehow Rock Opera while at the same time sounding like Muse.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Antonio Vivaldi, born in Venice in 1678, was a virtuoso violinist and composer, known for his innovative and&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Antonio Vivaldi, born in Venice in 1678, was a virtuoso violinist and composer, known for his innovative and descriptive music. His father, a part-time professional violinist and flamboyant hairdresser, taught him the violin and instilled in him a love for the instrument. Vivaldi&#8217;s flaming ginger locks earned him the nickname &#8220;Red Priest&#8221; when he entered the clergy, but his asthma made it difficult for him to recite Mass, leading him to abandon his religious duties and become a violin teacher.</p>



<p>It was in 1712 that he wrote Violin Concerto in A minor, Op. 3 No. 6, the sixth concerto in his 12 concerto collection &#8211; L&#8217;Estro Armonico. Overall it sounded too virtuosic for the solo violin, especially the first and third movements. </p>



<p>The three movements offer a delightful journey through contrasting tempos and moods. The first movement is vibrant and energetic, with intricate melodies that challenge the violinist&#8217;s technical skills. In contrast, the Largo movement introduces a serene and contemplative atmosphere, allowing for expressive phrasing and emotional depth. The final movement brings a lively and spirited conclusion, showcasing a rhythmic drive and dynamic contrasts.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Vivaldi&#8217;s career took a significant turn when he became the music director of a Venetian orphanage in 1716, where he was tasked with writing two concertos a month for the all-girls orchestra. In 1718, he took a second job as Chapel Master for the governor of Mantua, where he found inspiration in the beautiful North Italian countryside. This led to the creation of his most famous work, The Four Seasons, which he dedicated to the orphan girls back home.</p>



<p>The Four Seasons is not a single piece, but a set of four separate violin concertos, each with three movements, that are part of a larger collection of 12 violin concertos titled &#8220;The Contest between Harmony and Invention.&#8221; Each concerto is written for solo violin, accompanied by violins, viola, and basso continuo, and corresponds to a specific season: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.</p>



<p>Vivaldi&#8217;s Four Seasons is considered one of the earliest examples of program music, as it is accompanied by a series of sonnets that describe the scenes and emotions of each season. Vivaldi printed the text of the sonnets in the music and even inserted descriptive words next to particular notes, guiding performers on how to interpret the piece.</p>



<p>Throughout he creates diverse settings with his music, translating the vivid sights and sensations of each season into an amazing sonic narrative. Despite the short instrumentation, his composition creates powerful and diverse settings for listeners to discover. The first concerto, Spring, opens with an infectiously happy theme, followed by a chorus of singing birds, a gentle breeze, and a thunderstorm. The second concerto, Summer, begins with the oppressive heat of the sun, a singing turtle dove, a goldfinch, and a violent storm. The third concerto, Autumn, celebrates the bountiful harvest with a village dance, a drunken display of virtuosity, and a hunting scene. The final concerto, Winter, depicts the harsh cold, an icy wind, the chattering of teeth, and a cosy fire.</p>

<p>Around the 1730s, Vivaldi&#8217;s later years were lived with financial struggles and a waning interest in his musical endeavours, as the shifting musical landscape of the Enlightenment era posed challenges to his traditional Baroque style. The decline in demand for his operatic works and the ban on opera performances following the death of Emperor Charles VI contributed to Vivaldi&#8217;s financial hardships and dwindling popularity in Vienna. Despite his erstwhile celebrity and wealth, Vivaldi&#8217;s final years were marred by poverty, culminating in his passing in 1741.</p>



<p>Despite his celebrity and riches in his lifetime, he died in poverty, and his extraordinary music slowly disappeared. The rediscovery of his music began in Italy when Alberto Gentilly, a lecturer in musical history at the University of Turin, made an unexpected and important musical discovery in 1927. He was sent to value a collection of music that was for sale at the Collegio San Marco in the small town of San Martino Natale. Gentilly found 14 volumes of music by Vivaldi, which contained 140 instrumental works, 29 cantatas, 12 operas, and an oratorio. It was an amazing find, but there was more excitement to come. Gentilly realized that half of the collection was missing, and he had a brainwave that it might be part of a split inheritance. He tracked down the rest of the collection and persuaded the reluctant aristocratic owner to sell it. Vivaldi, who had been regarded by experts as a minor figure of the Baroque era, was about to become a major star.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tomás Luis de Victoria was born around 1548 in Avila, Spain, and passed away in 1611 in Madrid.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tomás Luis de Victoria was born around 1548 in Avila, Spain, and passed away in 1611 in Madrid. He is considered one of the greatest composers of the 16th century, alongside Palestrina and Orlando di Lasso. His career spanned both Spain and Italy, and he was known for his almost exclusively sacred and polyphonic vocal music, set to Latin texts.</p>



<p>Victoria was sent by King Philip II of Spain in 1565 to prepare for holy orders at the German College in Rome. He may have studied with Palestrina around this time, and certainly, he was influenced by the Italian style. He held various positions, including chapelmaster and instructor of plainsong. In 1575, Victoria was appointed Maestro di Capella at S. Apollinare.</p>



<p>Notably, Victoria devoted himself entirely to composing sacred music, unlike many of his peers who also composed secular works. His works include 21 masses and 44 motets. He also wrote psalm settings, hymns, several Magnificats, four offices for the dead, and music for Holy Week services. His last work was the Requiem Officium Defunctorum (1605) in memory of the empress Maria.</p>



<p>Victoria’s music is known for its depth of purpose, which I found very present in O Magnum Mysterium. He fused the contrapuntal technique of Palestrina with an intense dramatic feeling that is uniquely personal and deeply Spanish.</p>



<p>As for comments by his contemporaries, specific records are scarce. However, his influence on later Spanish composers was incalculable. His pupils included Manuel de Falla, Isaac Albéniz, and Enrique Granados. His editions of early Spanish music laid the foundations of Spanish musicology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Humanism is a philosophical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings. Specifically, humanism affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives, rather than have meaning imposed externally by a higher power. Humanism focuses on human values, capacities, and worth. It places importance on human dignity and rationality.</p>



<p>Humanism originated during the Renaissance in 14th-century Italy as a cultural movement promoting classical learning and values.</p>



<p>Some key principles of humanism include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Emphasis on critical thinking and evidence over dogma</li>



<li>The belief that truth is discovered by human endeavour rather than revealed by a higher power</li>



<li>Commitment to the use of reason and science as ways of understanding the natural world and our place within it</li>
</ul>



<p>The humanist focus on human dignity, potential, and values translated into music that highlighted the skills and creativity of individual composers and performers. Complex polyphonic styles and instrumental music developed to showcase composer and performer virtuosity.</p>



<p>Humanist themes praised human emotions, experiences, intellect, and achievements became common musical subject matter. Vocal music with texts exploring love, loss, joy, carpe diem etc reflected humanist ideals.</p>



<p>Humanism&#8217;s emphasis on earthly life led to the growing popularity of secular music styles like madrigals and dance music. The use of vernacular languages instead of Latin also became more common, reflecting humanist values.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In my research on the history of dissonance, I discovered an insightful video by Alan Belkin that shed light on the evolution and usage of dissonance in music. Belkin makes a compelling point about the shift from vocal music to instrumental music and how this transition impacted the use of dissonance. Dissonance is more challenging to employ in vocal music, as singers must accurately hit the notes, especially when dealing with large intervals. In contrast, instruments can easily play virtually any interval.</p>



<p>Throughout music history, composers have used dissonance in various ways to achieve different effects. In the Baroque Era, composers like Bach utilised dissonance to build tension, which would then resolve to consonance. Bach employed suspension, creating dissonance that the ear accepts because it anticipates the resolution. This added drama and interest to the music.</p>



<p>During the Classical Era, composers like Mozart used dissonance sparingly to heighten emotion at strategic moments. Quick resolutions maintained overall harmonic stability. Mozart would occasionally insert dissonant notes into otherwise consonant themes, creating a playful dissonance.</p>



<p>In the Romantic Era, composers exploited dissonance more freely to convey intense emotions. Pieces often lingered in dissonance before resolving, using clashing intervals and chords to evoke strong feelings.</p>



<p>The 20th century saw composers like Arnold Schoenberg introduce the concept of the &#8220;emancipation of dissonance,&#8221; aiming to treat dissonant intervals and chords as equals with consonant ones. Additionally, microtonal music was created on top of dissonant sounds, generating micro-dissonances that could be subtle or very harsh.</p>



<p>In styles like jazz, dissonant seventh chords became fundamental building blocks of the harmonic language. For example, Gershwin&#8217;s harmonic language is infused with tangy flavors and impish energy through the use of juicy seventh chords.</p>



<p>Belkin argues that the true emancipation of dissonance lies not in using it constantly, but rather employing it strategically to create expressive effects. The perceived tension of dissonance depends on several factors, including the intervals between notes and the register (pitch) of the notes. The closer the notes are and the smaller the intervals between them, the more dissonance there is. However, there is a limit to how intense dissonance can become. A skilled composer will use dissonance purposefully to create expressive effects, rather than incorporating it merely for its own sake.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During the early Middle Ages (800-1450), the Catholic Church held significant power over many cultural aspects, including music. As the clergy and a select few were the only individuals capable of reading and writing, the Church was responsible for creating most music notation. These notations were meticulously crafted in highly decorative manuscripts known as illuminated manuscripts, which were carefully copied by scribes, often monks, onto parchment or vellum.</p>



<p>The process of handwriting and copying music was incredibly time-consuming and resource-intensive, with each manuscript requiring substantial effort to complete. This laborious process limited the number of copies of each piece of music, making the widespread distribution of music challenging. Additionally, the human factor introduced the possibility of errors, with each copy potentially containing inaccuracies rather than being a faithful reproduction of the original.</p>



<p>By the late 15th century, a new technique emerged for printing music, known as woodblock printing. In 1450, Johann Gutenberg&#8217;s invention of the printing press revolutionized the music world. With the advent of printing, the time and resources required to reproduce a sheet of music decreased significantly, leading to a rapid increase in the dissemination of musical scores across Europe. The fidelity of printing not only reduced the errors caused by human copying but also helped standardize musical notation.</p>



<p>One of the most significant impacts of the printing press was the reduction in the cost of reproducing music sheets. As scores became more accessible to musicians and the public, ideas and artistic movements spread more quickly, encouraging the development of new musical styles.</p>



<p>Although Gutenberg&#8217;s invention was a major breakthrough, other technological advancements also played a crucial role in disseminating music. Audio recording allowed for musical preservation and freed music from being locally confined. With recording technology, music performed in one part of the world could be experienced in another, providing a similar listening experience. Simultaneously, the widespread adoption of radio technology enabled music to be broadcast into homes, stimulating interest in various genres.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the internet has been a significant contributor to the widespread dissemination of music. In the present day, music is more accessible than ever, as digitized tracks can be instantly accessed globally, providing creators with platforms to share their work with a broad audience.</p>



<p>In conclusion, since Gutenberg&#8217;s invention, the dissemination of music has been closely tied to technological advancements. These developments have reduced the time and resources required to create and distribute music, making it more accessible to people around the world than ever before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Musical patronage has been a long-standing tradition in the world of arts, with its roots tracing back to ancient civilizations. It is a system where individuals or organizations provide financial support to musicians, enabling them to create and perform their work. This relationship between patrons and artists is complex and multifaceted, offering numerous advantages and some potential drawbacks.</p>



<p>One of the most apparent benefits of musical patronage is the financial support it provides to artists. Patrons offer direct financial backing, which allows musicians to focus on their creative work without the burden of financial worries. This financial stability can lead to a higher quality of work, as artists can devote their time and energy to honoring their craft rather than worrying about survival.</p>



<p>Musical patronage also extends its benefits to the wider community. Patrons who are familiar with the local music scene can support projects that benefit the community at large. This could involve funding music education programs, sponsoring community concerts, or supporting local music festivals. These initiatives not only enrich the cultural life of the community but also foster a sense of belonging and unity among its members.</p>



<p>Another significant advantage of musical patronage is its role in cultural preservation. Throughout history, patronage has been instrumental in preserving countless masterpieces and cultural heritage. Today, patrons continue this tradition by funding projects that preserve and promote historical and traditional music. This ensures that these musical traditions are not lost to time but are instead passed down to future generations.</p>



<p>However, musical patronage is not without its potential drawbacks. One of the main concerns is the dependency on patrons. Artists may become overly reliant on their patrons, which could compromise their artistic integrity. This could lead to a situation where artists are creating work to please their patrons rather than following their own creative vision. It is crucial that arts remain free from constraints other than those of the creators themselves.</p>



<p>Another potential issue is the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few patrons. This can perpetuate social hierarchies and favor artists with connections or privilege. It can also lead to a lack of meritocracy, where qualifications become secondary to loyalty. This could result in unqualified individuals occupying important positions in the music industry.</p>



<p>In my view, a healthy balance is the ideal solution. The market works well for popular styles of music, where artists can earn a living through sales and performances. However, I believe that there should always be some form of patronage to support music that may not be commercially viable but is culturally or artistically significant. For instance, state funding can support foundations dedicated to preserving national music heritage and education. Private and corporate patrons also play a crucial role in promoting new artists, especially those from lower-income backgrounds who may not have the connections or resources to showcase their work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 id="the-shawm" class="wp-block-heading">The Shawm</h2>



<p>The shawm is an ancient double-reed wind instrument, introduced to Europe during the Crusades, that is considered a predecessor to the modern oboe. Its sound is produced by blowing through a reed, causing it to vibrate. Shawms were played by medieval and Renaissance musicians and used in dance and ceremonial music.</p>



<h2 id="the-viol" class="wp-block-heading">The Viol</h2>



<p>The viol is a bowed, string instrument that was popular during the 16th to 18th centuries. Its sound is produced by drawing a bow across its strings. It shares similarities in tuning and construction with the Renaissance lute. The viol is an ancestor of the modern violin family. It was played by chamber musicians and used in ensemble music.</p>



<h2 id="the-crumhorn" class="wp-block-heading">The Crumhorn</h2>



<p>The crumhorn is a Renaissance-era double reed woodwind that produces sound through a vibrating reed. Its cylindrical body curves upward at one end. The crumhorn is an early form of double reed instruments like the modern oboe or bassoon. It was played by court and street musicians during the Renaissance and used for dance music.</p>



<h2 id="the-sackbut" class="wp-block-heading">The Sackbut</h2>



<p>The sackbut is an early form of slide trombone, played from the Renaissance through the Baroque eras. Its telescopic slide mechanism alters tube length to change pitches. Sound emanates from buzzing lips against a cupped mouthpiece. The sackbut was played by Renaissance and Baroque instrumental ensembles and used in a variety of secular and sacred musical contexts.</p>



<h2 id="the-dulcian" class="wp-block-heading">The Dulcian</h2>



<p>The dulcian is a double reed ancestor of the bassoon that was popular 1550-1700. Like other double reeds, its sound comes from vibrating reeds. Dulcians were played by Renaissance and early Baroque instrumental consorts and used in chamber and orchestral settings.</p>



<h2 id="the-clavichord" class="wp-block-heading">The Clavichord</h2>



<p>The clavichord is a stringed keyboard instrument that produces sound by striking its brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents. It was mainly used in the Late Middle Ages through the Classical era. The clavichord is a forerunner of the piano and other keyboard instruments. It was played primarily by amateur musicians to accompany songs or for personal enjoyment.</p>



<h2 id="the-lute" class="wp-block-heading">The Lute</h2>



<p>The lute is a plucked string instrument and important precursor to the guitar. Its strings are plucked by the performer and its hollow body amplifies the sound. Lutes were extremely popular Renaissance instruments played by amateur and professional musicians. They were utilized in song accompaniment, chamber music, and solo performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently came across this piece on social media and quickly remembered of having heard it before in the TV show Mozart In The Jungle. However, I hadn&#8217;t given it much attention until now. I&#8217;ve just listened to the performance of the Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar conducted by Gustavo Dudamel.</p>



<p>This is the type of music I am naturaly drawn to. Great melodies combined with a dancing Latin rhythm is something that I find fits beautifully with an orchestral setting.</p>



<p>Here I found the instrumentation to be interesting, not only for the inclusion of non-traditional Western instruments like the Claves and the Guiro, but also the use of the violas as guitars with their strings being plucked.</p>



<p>The opening minutes of the piece have a medley-like quality, with various rhythms and tonal colors unfolding. From the smooth melodic start on the winds, passing to the strings and then a build-up of the piano before the full orchestra blows in a surge of powerful brass and percussion, instantly recognisable as a quintessential Latin sound.</p>



<p>This change in mood is perhaps what I liked more about this piece. The melodies are beautiful and soft, but when the rhythmic part enters in action, the whole piece gains an energy that is danceable and contagious.</p>



<p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this piece, and since I&#8217;m not yet familiar with the work of Arturo Márquez, I&#8217;m eager to explore more of his compositions.</p>
