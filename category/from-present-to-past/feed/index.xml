										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This part of the course was challenging, but the end result made it all worth it. I never expected to spend so much time on it, especially since I have a full-time job and two young children. However, I can’t say that I regret the time spent because it was well worth it.</p>



<p>One of the most interesting aspects of this part was studying how composers in the 20th century started breaking the established conventions of tonality and harmony. It’s also interesting to see how this connects to major events like the World Wars.</p>



<p>Most of my time was spent diving deep into research for this assignment. I followed the advice of choosing a style that I was not familiar with, so I decided to focus on microtonal music. Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed learning about this style even though it challenged every notion and expectation that I had about its music.</p>



<p>For my research, I had one big question in mind for this assignment. How does microtonality improve the expressiveness of music? And the answer is clear: microtonality gives composers a wider range of pitches and harmonies to use. The effect is a more nuanced feel that’ll create diverse musical effects. It’s almost as if you gave a painter an even bigger palette of colours. Essentially, it allows music to have stronger emotions and meanings.</p>



<p>In my assignment, I think I was able to present my findings in an easy way to understand. However, I think there’s definitely still more to learn about this topic that wasn’t covered here. One thing is for sure, microtonalist composers liked to use this as a way to explore new ways of expression. And we can definitely see that in their work ranging from Carrillo to Collier.</p>



<p>For me, the biggest discovery was the connection between microtonality and the human voice. As Partch demonstrated in his opera King Oedipus, microtonality can capture the natural inflexions and variations of the voice that aren&#8217;t limited to 12 tones. This makes it a powerful tool for expressing human emotion and experience.</p>



<p>One question that still lingers in my mind is: is microtonal music a style or technique? On one hand, there are complete musical pieces composed entirely with microtonal intervals which suggests that microtonality is a distinctive style. Then, on the other hand, I learned that it can be used in any genre or style as an expressive tool. Maybe it’s both depending on how it’s applied and perceived.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I think this research was valuable because I was able to appreciate and understand microtonal music better. Plus, it inspired me to try composing my own music using microtonal intervals. Which should be easier with today&#8217;s technology.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Microtonal music doesn&#8217;t have a universally accepted definition. For example, The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Microtonal music doesn&#8217;t have a universally accepted definition. For example, The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians discusses microtones but not microtonal music (Ader, 2020). But it generally refers to using musical notes between the standard intervals.</p>



<p>The lack of consensus may be because microtonality has wide applications &#8211; from subtle timbre changes to entirely new sounds challenging traditional concepts of harmony and melody. But what is true about it is that microtonal music has the potential to broaden music&#8217;s expressive range. Dividing tones into fractions under a semitone allows composers to create new harmonies, melodies, and textures, evoking more emotions and ideas, and accurately simulating non-Western music.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that discussing microtonal music risks being too Western-centric. Equal temperament is the main tuning in Western popular music (Carlos, 1987). However, most world music, past and present, uses larger or smaller intervals than a semitone. Microtonality is integral to music cultures like Arab maqamat, African traditional, Indian classical shruti, Indonesian gamelan, Chinese, and more &#8211; each with unique tuning systems (Geer, 2014).</p>



<p>The microtonality found in many traditional musical traditions is often intuitive, based on the natural harmonics of instruments and the human voice. In contrast, the development of microtonality in Western music in the early twentieth century was more theoretical and experimental.</p>



<p>Ader defends that the fragmentation that occurred in the world of art during the early twentieth century was a major catalyst for the development of microtonality in music (2020). This was due to the breaking down of traditional forms in poetry and visual arts, which drove artists to explore the essence of their art forms, challenge conventions, and find new modes of expression. Poets began to focus on phonemes and sound, while visual artists dismantled traditional structures. This spirit of experimentation and focus on the most elemental components of an art form also inspired composers to explore microtonality.</p>



<p>Several composers explored microtonality, including Ivan Wyschnegradsky, Ferruccio Busoni, Charles Ives, and Ben Johnston. Alois Hába, Harry Partch, and Julián Carrillo represent slightly different perspectives and are worth discussing further.</p>



<p>Alois Hába (1893-1973), a Czech composer, teacher, and theorist, was a microtonal music pioneer. He grew up in Moravia, where he was influenced by local folk music and subsequently developed an interest in microtones (Forkert, 2020:79). Further encouraged by composers like Ferruccio Busoni and Hermann Scherchen, Hába created his own quarter-tone system, aiming to enhance tonality rather than replace it. As a teacher and theorist at the Prague Conservatoire, he educated many in microtonal composition and advocated for tonality preservation while using microtones. His compositions, including quartets, operas, and chamber music, blended tonal and microtonal elements in a distinct sound. His immense contribution to microtonal music influenced many composers, marking important milestones in 20th-century music.</p>



<p>Harry Partch (1901-1974) was an American just intonation pioneer. He was inspired by a German physicist’s book, leading him to create over 30 custom instruments for a 43-note octave scale, compared to the conventional 12-note. His pursuit led him to create over 30 custom musical instruments capable of producing a scale with an impressive 43 notes per octave, a significant departure from the conventional 12-note octave found on the piano. He invented his own notation system to represent the microtones in his music (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, no date). Partch’s motivation was to emulate the fluidity and expressive range of the human voice, which he believed was inadequately represented by traditional scales. Throughout his life, Partch remained dedicated to pushing the boundaries of music, challenging established norms, and exploring the untapped potential of sound. His enduring legacy is preserved at institutions like the Harry Partch Institute at the University of Washington, where musicians and enthusiasts continue to study, perform, and even recreate his innovative instruments.</p>



<p>The Mexican composer Julián Carrillo (1875-1965) claimed to have discovered microtones in 1895 by dividing violin strings into sixteenths. However, he did not compose microtonal music until 1922 when he became aware of the European microtone scene. Carrillo then developed an elaborate microtonal system called Sonido 13 that divided the octave into quarter tones and smaller intervals. He promoted Sonido 13 as a revolutionary break from the 12-tone octave that would destroy existing music, in contrast to European composers who saw microtones as an extension of tradition. Carrillo also theorized his system extensively in books and articles, conducting tuning experiments on harps and making conclusions about harmonics and acoustics. Though often aggressive in tone, Carrillo&#8217;s writings laid out a systematic microtonal theory unmatched by his European contemporaries. With Sonido 13, Carrillo sought to assert Mexico&#8217;s claim over microtones against European musical dominance.</p>



<p>The influence of pioneering composers in microtonality resonates through the years, extending into contemporary music. A notable instance is Paul Simon&#8217;s album &#8220;Stranger To Stranger,&#8221; which incorporated Harry Partch&#8217;s custom-made microtonal instrument collection.</p>



<p>Contemporary composers, such as Horaţiu Rădulescu, Krzysztof Penderecki, and Ryo Noda, have significantly contributed to the assimilation of notated microtonality into the contemporary musical canon.</p>



<p>Modern Western music has not forgotten microtonality, although it has long been used as an ornamental embellishment to add tension. The most familiar example is the bending of notes, where pitches often end up between the semitone intervals, creating microtones. A more recent example is Hans Zimmer&#8217;s use of microtonal string glissandos in the Joker&#8217;s theme for The Dark Knight soundtrack. The strings rise through several microtones between chromatic pitches, creating an extremely unsettling sound. A similar microtonal string effect occurs at the end of Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;How to Disappear Completely.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although temperament and expanded tunings were not historically adopted by pop and rock musicians, often avoiding them in favour of heavy pitch correction with auto-tune, there has been a recent surge in interest from modern artists. Dua Lipa, Sza, Jacob Collier, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, and They Might Be Giants have incorporated microtones into their music, pushing the boundaries of pop, rock, and electronica.</p>



<p>Technology has played a pivotal role in pushing microtonality into the forefront of music. Software like Ableton Live has made it easier to integrate microtonal tunings (Hart, 2016). This has led many microtonal EDM musicians to craft their own tunings, seeking new intervals and sonorities beyond conventional tuning systems.</p>



<p>Ultimately, microtonal music has the potential to enlarge the expressive potential of music by adding finer nuances and more complex language. By dividing the usual Western twelve-tone scale into smaller intervals it is possible to arrive at new harmonies and melodies unavailable within the common system. This creates more varied emotional expressions and new sound textures and colours. Comparable to how unquantized percussion revolutionised hip-hop in the 1990s, microtonality can contradict listeners&#8217; assumptions, creating tension and release different from what is possible within the established Western system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul></ul>



<p>I must admit, prior to this, I was unfamiliar with Partch so this is my initial experience listening to any of his compositions. Partch was indeed a uniquely creative artist, as he was known for not only inventing his own musical instruments but also scoring his compositions for a 43-tone scale unique to these instruments.</p>



<p>Despite being created over 70 years ago (1950), this piece remains surprisingly fresh and innovative. The composition is marked by its distinct sound, thanks to the use of Partch&#8217;s own instruments like the Bass Marimba and the Hypobass.</p>



<p>Although the microtonal melodies and harmonies of the piece often sounded to me as dissonant and jarring, it&#8217;s the unsettling sound contrasted with the comical visual of the instruments that makes it so unique. The sonata is a satirical work going into themes of madness, delusion, and paranoia.</p>



<p>This composition thoroughly blends humour and lightness with hints of darker territories. The lyrics of the piece might seem nonsensical on the surface, but they carry potential interpretations concerning the human condition.</p>



<p>Listening to &#8216;Sonata Dementia&#8217; is a challenging experience. The microtonality might initially seem daunting, but it may not be as intricate as expected. The initial dissonance from the 43-tone scale, which might seem hard to accept at first, gradually becomes more harmonic and natural as the pieces develop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently listened to some parts of King Oedipus, an opera composed by Harry Partch. I was drawn to listen to it because of the information about how Partch started to dive into microtonality, as it more closely resembles the natural human voice. This actually makes total sense for opera. People don&#8217;t speak in 12 semitones, but actually in hundreds of microtones and opera relies heavily on the expression of the voice. As I listened to King Oedipus, I noticed how the voices sounded more like speech than singing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partch&#8217;s music for King Oedipus is a unique blend of microtonality, percussion, and spoken word. The voices sound more natural, not sung, but spoken. The instruments follow the vocals and strangely don&#8217;t sound as strange as they do in other microtonal pieces by Partch. The microtonality allows the voices to more closely match natural speech patterns, rather than conforming to the 12 notes of standard Western music. I enjoyed listening to King Oedipus, even though I did not hear the whole opera. It was a refreshing and stimulating experience that opened my ears to new possibilities of musical expression.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Julian Carrillo&#8217;s Seis casi-sonatas en cuartos de tono para violoncello solo, performed by Gerardo Gimenez Cacho, offers a fascinating glimpse into the expressive potential of microtonal music. As someone accustomed to the familiar 12-tone equal temperament of Western classical music, I found these quarter-tone sonatas surprisingly easy to listen to and appreciate. The solo cello format helps make the microtones feel intimate rather than jarring.</p>



<p>With these sonatas, I could understand how dividing the octave into smaller intervals can open up new sonic palettes and colours. Microtonality provides the performer access to the &#8220;cracks between the keys&#8221; &#8211; those poignant notes that float between our conventional Western pitches. The cello seems to emote in ways that would be impossible with merely 12 notes.</p>



<p>I cannot imagine how difficult these pieces must be to perform well, given the challenge of precisely nailing pitches outside of the equal temperament celloists spend years mastering. The skill demonstrated in this recording is hugely impressive.</p>



<p>Occasionally the quarter tones sound somewhat unsettling, but more often I found they enhanced the cello&#8217;s innate expressiveness. For example, the aching melody in the third movement of Sonata No. 4 attains an extra sadness from its microtonal sounds. The result is something simultaneously familiar and novel.</p>



<p>The quarter tones may initially sound like &#8220;out of tune&#8221; notes, but one&#8217;s ear quickly adjusts, and their emotional resonance becomes apparent. Julian Carrillo has created a compelling showcase for the cello as an instrument of uncommon subtlety. Even for listeners new to microtonality, these Casi-sonatas offer an accessible and rewarding introduction.</p>

<p>Listening to Jacob Collier&#8217;s &#8220;In The Bleak Midwinter&#8221; was an enlightening experience for me as I researched microtonality in modern music. As one of the most talented young musicians today, Collier&#8217;s ingenious use of microtones immediately drew me in. The track begins deceivingly simple but slowly builds in complexity. At one point, Collier modulates to what sounds like a G#. However, with microtonal inflexions, he has actually modulated to the key of G half-sharp major &#8211; something I did not detect on the first listen! The modulation is brilliantly executed, such that the music flows seamlessly.  I had to understand how he modulated and David Bruce helped me on that.</p>

<p>As I re-listened and focused on the microtonal shift, I better appreciated Collier&#8217;s technical mastery and innovative musicality. &#8220;In The Bleak Midwinter&#8221; proves he is not just one of the best musicians of our time, but one boldly expanding the boundaries of Western music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Radiohead is not a band that I particularly enjoy listening to, but I decided to listen to How to Disappear Completely to hear its use of microtonality. </p>



<p>The song starts off with a simple guitar and Thom Yorke&#8217;s falsetto vocals, nothing too unusual for a Radiohead track. The lyrics are vague and ambiguous, but they convey a sense of detachment and dissociation from reality. The song gradually builds up with layers of orchestral strings, guitar effects, and electronic sounds, creating a rich and complex sonic landscape. About two-thirds of the way through, the strings come in playing microtonal intervals that clash with the conventional instrumentation. These non-standard pitches on the strings create an unsettling, tense atmosphere contrasting with the dreamy opening section. The microtonal strings sound almost like they&#8217;re playing a separate song altogether, weaving an anxious counter-melody against the main chords. </p>



<p>This incoherent effect highlights Yorke&#8217;s lyrics about feeling disconnected from reality. While Radiohead isn&#8217;t my go-to band, I found &#8220;How to Disappear Completely&#8221; an interesting song with the use of microtonality to convey emotional dissociation in music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I enjoyed Ives&#8217; Three Quarter Tone Pieces for Two Pianos more than Hába&#8217;s quarter-tone sonata. The interplay between the two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart, creates an intriguing sense of conversation. One piano is tuned to standard western 12-tone equal temperament, while the other uses quarter tones. At first, they both sound out of tune, which has a quirky, childlike quality. But at moments they harmonize in an unconventional way that sounds oddly &#8220;in tune.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I kept listening, I began to familiarize myself with the microtonal language. The quarter tones initially sound discordantly unfamiliar, but gradually become interesting as my ears adapt. Although the microtonal effect hasn&#8217;t become conventionally pleasing to my ears accustomed to the 12-note scale, I can recognize the inventive nature and derive pleasure from the music on its own merits.</p>



<p>Overall, the quarter-tone pieces demonstrate that microtonality is an acquired taste that requires time to appreciate. The outcome is a captivating sound that I can find enjoyable, even though it hasn&#8217;t fully convinced me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Strange is the first word that comes to my mind when listening to Hába&#8217;s Sonata for Quarter-Tone Piano, Op. 62. After researching microtonality, I&#8217;ve come to enjoy the concept and composers&#8217; reasons for exploring it. But the truth is my ears are so accustomed to the 12-semitone scale that I initially find microtonal music weird. Recent examples in rock and jazz, like King Gizzard and Jacob Collier, are growing on me. Yet even in the slower, more lyrical second movement of Hába&#8217;s sonata, I struggle to fully appreciate the quarter tones. </p>



<p>Making an effort to keep an open mind, I can sense the pioneering spirit of discovery in Hába’s quarter-tone innovations. They impart an otherworldly, dreamlike quality as my ear gradually adjusts. But my long familiarity with 12-tone equal temperament means microtones continue to sound strange at first, even as I recognize their creative possibilities. However, after listening to it more carefully, I started to notice there&#8217;s some beauty and subtlety of the quarter tones. The sonata has a lot of variation and contrast that I can see me appreciating it the more I listen to it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While graphic scores may seem like an unfamiliar concept to many, they hold profound importance in the world of music composition. Rather than using traditional musical notation, graphic scores convey musical instructions through abstract symbols, shapes and colours &#8211; offering more openness to interpretation between composer and performer. </p>



<p>One of the earliest known uses of graphic notation can be seen in the 15th-century score &#8220;Belle, Bonne, Sage&#8221; by Baude Cordier. Crafted in the shape of a heart, it was a pioneering example of &#8220;eye music&#8221; &#8211; utilizing the visual design of the score as part of the composition. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="795" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-795x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1707" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-795x1024.png 795w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-233x300.png 233w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-768x990.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-300x387.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-640x825.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1.png 838w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></figure>



<p>Modern graphic notation truly emerged in the 20th century. Morton Feldman&#8217;s 1950 work &#8220;Projection 1&#8221; for solo cello featured scores that resembled abstract art or circuit diagrams more than standard sheet music. It showcased a trully visual innovation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="253" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1709" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2.png 850w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2-300x89.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2-768x229.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2-640x190.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></figure>



<p>What fascinates me most about graphic scores is their versatility. Some composers provide detailed guidelines to steer performers towards a specific vision, like George Crumb&#8217;s illuminating score for &#8220;Agnus Dei [SYMBOL]&#8221;, which is less abstract and relies on traditional notation symbols.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="639" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-1024x639.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1711" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-1024x639.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-300x187.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-768x479.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-1536x958.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-2048x1278.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-640x399.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-960x599.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4.png 2436w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>However, others opt to leave symbols purposefully vague, inviting creative dialogue between visual structure and a performer&#8217;s artistic sensibilities. Cornelius Cardew&#8217;s massive &#8220;Treatise&#8221; is a stunning example, offering no instructions on interpretation or instrumentation across its 193 pages.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="638" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1024x638.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1710" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1024x638.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-300x187.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-768x479.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1536x957.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-640x399.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-960x598.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>More than just an alternative form of notation, graphic scores blur the lines of distinction between visual art and music composition. The visual design becomes an integral part of conveying musical ideas, shedding light on how we perceive and synthesize different modes of art. Some graphic scores can even represent or visualize an existing piece of music, creating a physical manifestation for an otherwise abstract, intangible sound landscape, like for example the work of Nicholas Rougeux.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="966" height="1449" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1712" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited.png 966w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-200x300.png 200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-683x1024.png 683w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-768x1152.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-300x450.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-640x960.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-960x1440.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As a Led Zeppelin fan, I was eager to check out the band Greta Van Fleet after a friend&#8217;s recommendation. While I enjoyed several of their retro-rock tracks that pay homage to Zeppelin&#8217;s classic sound, the song &#8220;Light My Love&#8221; stood out as my favourite.</p>



<p>The piano melody at the start sets up an interesting intro, but after a few bars, the song explodes into a full-on rock explosion. The lead singer, Josh Kiszka, has a voice that sounds remarkably similar to the legendary Robert Plant &#8211; soaring and crystalline one moment, then shifting into joyful wails that drive the energy ever higher.</p>



<p>Though the chorus repeats in typical pop fashion, the anthemic sound of guitars and drums keeps it from being repetitive. Kiszka unleashes some spectacular high screams that electrify the lyrics. Overall, while Greta Van Fleet wears their influences proudly, &#8220;Light My Love&#8221; shows they can also craft an exhilarating retro-rock song that stands on its own. For a Led Zeppelin fan like me, it left me eager to hear more from this talented young band.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I really enjoy Steve Reich&#8217;s Clapping Music. It&#8217;s a creative and fascinating piece that uses only clapping to build intricate rhythms. There are no harmonies or melodies—just two performers clapping.</p>



<p>The background of this composition is also interesting. In 1972, Reich was inspired by a flamenco duo&#8217;s clapping patterns in Brussels and decided to apply his compositional technique called phasing to clapping. This resulted in a piece that became a major milestone in Reich&#8217;s career and helped reinforce Minimalism as a fresh perspective after the complexity of atonality.</p>



<p>The piece has clear instructions for the performers. The two performers begin clapping their assigned patterns in unison. One performer maintains their pattern unchanged, while the other performer gradually shifts their pattern ahead by one eighth-note at a time. This process of phase shifting creates a polyrhythmic texture as the parts drift apart. It&#8217;s hypnotic to hear the simple claps interweave. As the patterns phase apart, the texture grows denser and more energetic. When they realign, it&#8217;s satisfyingly resolved.</p>



<p>I admire how Reich does so much with something so basic. The phasing technique adds great depth to something so simple. The repeating patterns make me feel meditative and mindful. It&#8217;s always surprising to hear the different rhythms emerge. The subtle changes keep me engaged throughout the almost 5 minutes . This music shows Reich&#8217;s skill with rhythm and repetition: using just claps, he creates music that is complex and trance-like. Ultimately, I believe the piece serves as a creative study of musical texture and rhythm using only the fundamental human instrument: the clap.</p>



<p>One final small detail: At the end of a live performance, the audience uses the same instrument as the performers. I believe it&#8217;s the only piece of music where this happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Shostakovich faced inte­nse criticism and potential perse­cution from Soviet authorities for his controversial ope­ra, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. In response­ to Stalin&#8217;s anger at a performance of the opera, Shostakovich withdrew his Fourth Symphony. According to several publications, Shostakovich composed the Fifth Symphony in 1937 to rede­em himself and align with Soviet ide­als. This symphony served as an opportunity for him to showcase his talent while moving away from the avant-garde nature of his music that had previously been denounced.</p>



<p>The final movement&#8217;s different interpre­tations, influenced by the different interpretations of the tempo, have sparked extensive debates. Some conductors prefer to play it faster than others.</p>



<p>Listening to various recordings, a faster tempo such as the recording of Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic tends to convey a sense of forward momentum, a relentless push towards what could be perceived as a triumph. On the other hand, slower performances, like the one conducted by Yevgeny Mravinsky and performed by the Leningrad Philharmonic, allow for the finer details of the piece to sink in. They offer the listener more time to breathe in the music and as a result, the piece sounds more laboured, possibly invoking darker, ominous undertones.</p>



<p>When taking a closer listening, one can understand that, beyond tempo, phrasing and dynamics also shape interpretations about this final movement. I personally like it best when it&#8217;s played at a moderate speed. This lets the music move forward while giving space for the small details. It finds a good balance.</p>



<p>After my research and several listenings, I found that the faster tempo seems to dismiss the turmoil and complexities underpinning this symphony&#8217;s creation. A slower tempo, while adding additional detail and space for interpretation, can add an overemphasized drama.</p>



<p>Given the circumstances under which Shostakovich composed this symphony, it seems more correct to interpret the finale as not a full triumph nor complete despair, but rather an ambiguous commentary reflecting Shostakovich&#8217;s precarious position.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Benjamin Britten&#8217;s opera Peter Grimes premiered at Sadler&#8217;s Wells Theatre in London on June 7, 1945. Britten had begun sketching the work in 1941 while living in America with his partner Peter Pears during WWII. After reading George Crabbe&#8217;s poem &#8216;The Borough,&#8217; Britten felt a surge of inspiration to write an opera set in the Suffolk fishing village of his youth. Though he used Crabbe&#8217;s character Peter Grimes as his protagonist, Britten departed from the poem&#8217;s storyline to craft an original libretto with Montagu Slater. The libretto humanizes Grimes while retaining his inherent violence and ambiguity.</p>



<p>Peter Grimes follows the story of a fisherman named Peter Grimes who is accused of murdering his apprentice boys. The opera explores themes of mob mentality and persecution of outsiders. The use of tonality in &#8216;Peter Grimes&#8217; is characterized by tritone relationships. The opera&#8217;s dramatic movement is generated by tonal progressions between the keys of A and E flat, symbolizing the impossibility of coexistence for Grimes and the Borough. It is this eerie score depicting the inner turmoil of the protagonist Peter Grimes, that lends the emotional power to the opera.</p>



<p>Peter Grimes was hailed as a landmark in British opera when it premiered. The conductor was Reginald Goodall and Peter Pears performed the role of Grimes. It was the first of Britten&#8217;s operas to gain international acclaim and launched his career as one of the leading opera composers of the 20th century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sonatas and interludes for Prepared Piano &#8211; This piece has a strong focus on rhythm. The prepared piano, with objects placed on and between strings, creates an unconventional timbre. Yet within this unique soundworld, Cage constructs an organized and cohesive musical work. I heard some resemblance to Javanese Gamelan music and some parts reminded me of the Rite of Spring.</p>



<p>Imaginary Landscape No. 4 &#8211; Cage&#8217;s first piece of chance music. By tuning radios to different frequencies, chance collages of sounds, speech and music emerge. The juxtaposition of these fragments is unpredictable but often intriguing. It&#8217;s music created by randomness rather than conscious design. Though it abandons traditional musical elements, it has a sense of playfulness and spontaneity that I find amusing.</p>



<p>Roaratorio, an Irish circus on Finnegans Wake &#8211; I found it really hard to enjoy this long composition. Combines field recordings, spoken word, and segments of Irish traditional music into a sound collage. The complex overlays create textures and rhythms. </p>



<p>Regarding serial and chance music, both approaches challenge conventional tonality and require an open mind from the listener. Cage demonstrates that music can emerge from unconventional sound sources, chance procedures and found objects. He accomplished to expand the conceptions of music, art and listening.</p>



<p>The serialist pieces have a very ordered, logical structure that comes through clearly in the listening. The rigid rules of serialism &#8211; avoiding repetition, and ordered rotations through the 12 tones &#8211; result in cerebral, mathematical music.</p>



<p>In contrast, Cage&#8217;s chance music lacks that calculated complexity. The randomness and unpredictability create a more chaotic, spontaneous feel. While the serialist process is evident to the listener, Cage&#8217;s process is opaque. We cannot directly hear compositional systems, but I find this obscure and surprising thought interesting.</p>



<p>I  still believe that my definition of music is still valid in this discussion. While the composer organizes sounds and applies musical techniques, the real art happens in the listener&#8217;s mind. As Cage showed, music can emerge from non-traditional sounds when the listener lends them meaning. My definition recognizes how the listener&#8217;s role gives life and validity to music. Without the listener&#8217;s act of listening, there is no music.</p>



<p>Cage&#8217;s chance pieces may not convey traditional emotional arcs, but they can evoke moods like dissatisfaction, serendipity, and even humour. Serialist works induce intellectual stimulation more than direct emotion. But even in this case, a listener need not comprehend the serial process to be affected by the music&#8217;s dramatic quality.</p>



<p>So while the compositional approach shapes aesthetic effect, I believe music can deliver emotional impact being it systematically composed or leaving it to chance. The listener&#8217;s subjective experience remains central to lending music it meaning.</p>



<p>While the compositional approach undoubtedly shapes the aesthetic effect, I believe music retains the power to deliver emotional impact whether coming from a serialist complexity or Cage&#8217;s randomness. Ultimately, the listener&#8217;s subjective experience remains central to lending music its meaning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I decided to perform John Cage&#8217;s 4&#8217;33&#8221; alone in my living room. I set a timer to keep up track of the time. At first, there was complete silence as I sat motionless on a chair. After about a minute, I started to hear subtle sounds &#8211; the gentle creaking of the wooden floor, distant traffic noises outside, and the occasional sound of myself shifting in their chair. These ambient sounds almost took on a musical quality as I focused intently on listening.</p>



<p>The effect was surprisingly mesmerizing. In the absence of deliberate music, the mundane sounds, often unnoticed, took centre stage, and I immediately understood what Cage intended with this piece.</p>



<p>Around the two-minute mark, the silence was broken by my stomach rumbling loudly. I had to stifle a laugh at this unexpected bodily interjection. A few moments later, a siren wailed in the distance. The juxtaposition of these random noises with the intended silence of the piece was amusing to me.</p>



<p>When the 4 minutes and 33 seconds were up, I felt a sense of accomplishment. Although an audience may have enhanced the experience, performing 4&#8217;33&#8221; alone made me appreciate the musical potential of everyday sounds. I found beauty in the silence between the noises. This piece definitely expanded my perspective on what can be considered music.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There were several composers I could choose from this period. Still, since I have an appreciation for merging&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There were several composers I could choose from this period. Still, since I have an appreciation for merging styles of music, and I always liked Rhapsody in Blue, I decided to investigate George Gershwin&#8217;s work.</p>



<p>George Gershwin (1898 &#8211; 1937), a son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, became inspired to pursue music at a young age. He began writing songs while working for a music publisher in Manhattan’s Tin Pan Alley, which led to his first major hit, “Swanee” in 1916. Gershwin collaboratively wrote some of the most popular songs of the interwar period with his brother Ira, a number of which have remained standards in jazz music such as Summertime, I Got Rhythm and They Can’t Take That Away From Me. Gershwin also composed several renowned classical pieces such as Rhapsody in Blue, and An American in Paris, as well as the opera Porgy and Bess.</p>



<p>To understand the impact of Gershwin&#8217;s work, it&#8217;s helpful to analyse the context of the interwar national identity crisis. After WWI, countries looked to culture to define their identities. However, in the US, this was different. The country had many cultural traditions due to immigration and migration, leading to new musical styles. In 1893, Dvořák thought Black music should be the basis for an American classical style. By the 1920s, African-American genres like ragtime, blues, and jazz were popular nationwide. Gershwin used jazz in Rhapsody in Blue to create a unique American classical piece, that blended European and African American sounds, fulfilling Dvořák&#8217;s idea that Black music could define an American style.  Rhapsody in Blue was commissioned by Paul Whiteman with the intent of “classicizing” jazz to increase its respectability among white audiences. It debuted with Gershwin himself as the piano soloist, with a jazz band and a string section for accompaniment.</p>



<p>Listening to Rhapsody in Blue with this context in mind I can get even more out of the piece. I always loved how it mixed different styles, but now I can see how it blends together European and African-American music in a very special way. I think the piano part really stands out in this, changing from arpeggios and flourishes from Classic European music to more jazzy and bluesy ones.</p>



<p>Another Gershwin song I liked listening to was &#8220;I Got Rhythm&#8221;, which was written by the Gershwin brothers for the Broadway musical &#8220;Girl Crazy&#8221;. During this period, Broadway musicals were an important way to showcase music and were based on European operettas and comic operas. However, they were different as they included spoken dialogue, making them more accessible to everyone.</p>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t listened to it before, and the first time I listened to it, it sounded familiar, as if I had heard it before. After several listenings, I realised it was the syncopation and the call-response so usual in jazz that made it sound familiar. Actually, the chord progression from I Got Rhythm is known as the &#8220;rhythm changes&#8221;, and it&#8217;s the foundation for many other popular jazz tunes. </p>



<p>After realising the impact of this song, I decided to listen to his symphonic work Variations on &#8220;I Got Rhythm&#8221; for Piano and Orchestra. It caught me by surprise. It isn&#8217;t a piece of catchy pop music but it is inventive and, experimental but at the same time there&#8217;s always the jazzy feeling. I felt this could be the base of the development of Raphosy in Blues.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs4vYVdof8bc85dyGfx6svA"></a></p>



<p>Gershwin had a big influence on American music, even though his career was short. His works blended classical, jazz, and popular music, firmly establishing him as a leading figure in American modernism. His Broadway musicals, defied the notion that serious music had to remain distinct from popular culture, proving that meaningful music music could also entertain and be popular. While some classical critics initially questioned his approach, audiences and musicians loved it. His unique approach broke down music style barriers and brought an entire country together since he and others helped create a new American sound.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Maurice Ravel&#8217;s &#8220;Bolero&#8221; is a very well-known piece and is a masterful illustration of both orchestration and gradual development. Repeated continually, its single melody and rhythm manage to avoid monotony. Instead, Ravel uses a diversity of tonal colours, orchestral variation and incremental crescendo.</p>



<p>While not directly related to the music itself, I found Ravel&#8217;s background interesting context. His father was an accomplished inventor who created new machines and early cars. I believe that this exposure to machinery and technology as a child likely influenced Ravel&#8217;s fascination with mechanical sounds and rhythms, as evidenced in Bolero&#8217;s persistent snare drum beat.</p>



<p>Another intriguing aspect is Ravel&#8217;s use of the saxophone, uncommon in orchestral works of the era but prevalent in jazz. After listening, I researched possible jazz influences on Ravel. Indeed, he enjoyed jazz artists like Duke Ellington during a 1928 North American tour. He admired the percussive double bass and brassy glissandi. This openness seemingly inspired his experimentation in Bolero.</p>



<p>I&nbsp;deeply admire Ravel’s orchestration in &#8216;Bolero&#8217;.&nbsp;He fully exploits each instrument&#8217;s unique characteristics. His strategy of introducing the melody using different instruments in succession creates a unique texture and colour for each iteration of the theme. It’s not about a simple increase in the volume that results in the crescendo, but a careful layering of instruments that creates an intensifying texture within the piece.</p>



<p>The brief departure from the tonic key in the final segment of the piece, an unexpected occurrence in a piece that otherwise sticks rigidly to a single key, adds a mesmerising final twist. All the while, the steady percussion and pizzicato strings act as a grounding force, adding even more depth to the enthralling climax.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Varèse&#8217;s &#8220;Amériques&#8221; leaves me with mixed feelings. On one hand, I can appreciate its groundbreaking nature. Composed shortly after he moved to the U.S., you can sense this longing and curiosity, like he&#8217;s exploring new worlds. It&#8217;s wild and dissonant, with these intricate mixtures of percussion and wind instruments.</p>



<p>After hearing it, my definition of what music is hasn&#8217;t changed. I don&#8217;t want to come off as boastful, but I&#8217;m still convinced that music is a blend of sounds designed by a composer,  executed by a performer, which holds emotional significance for a human listener. This composition confirms my belief. Whether this is music or not really depends on the listener&#8217;s interpretation. In my view, it certainly is, although I didn&#8217;t fully appreciate it.</p>



<p>I actually want to appreciate &#8220;Amériques&#8221; for showcasing Varèse&#8217;s innovative spirit. But its interruptive, ever-changing nature also distances me from fully connecting with the music on an emotional level. While groundbreaking for its time, parts of its execution undermine my ability to fully experience what Varèse set out to convey about his new home and surroundings. Overall, I admire what he achieved, but also find myself holding it at arm&#8217;s length musically on repeated listens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;A remarkable step forward on the way towards the ideal of symphonic unity (…) With his fifth symphony Sibelius raises the genre of the symphony to an entirely new cyclic level.&#8221;</p>
<cite><em>Veijo Murtomäki, musicologist, 1990</em></cite></blockquote>



<h4 id="sibelius-symphony-no-5-in-e-flat-major-op-82" class="wp-block-heading">Sibelius&#8217; Symphony No. 5 in E-flat Major, Op. 82</h4>



<p>If there were any doubts about Sibelius being a national treasure even in his lifetime, they were completely dispelled by his 5th Symphony. Commissioned by the Finnish government to celebrate Sibelius&#8217;s 50th birthday – a national holiday – the symphony was premiered on the 8th December 1915, with Sibelius conducting the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. While the premiere in 1915 garnered success, it didn&#8217;t meet Sibelius&#8217;s personal standards. The work was revised twice, in 1916 and 1919, until it got the version we can hear today.</p>



<p>The uniqueness of this symphony lies in its cyclic unity &#8211; perhaps inspired by the cyclic nature of Finnish Folk music &#8211; with motifs recurring and transforming throughout the entire work. Its melodies are influenced by the sparse folk tunes of remote northern regions. The primal cell, heard in the opening horn call, contains the genetic code for all the important themes that follow. Sibelius moulds these themes with tremendous skill, subtly transforming them in each movement yet always retaining their essence.</p>



<p>The emotional pinnacle of the symphony is reached in the finale. Inspired by the sight of sixteen swans in flight, the finale depicts their rustling wings with trembling strings beneath an expansive melody. A majestic &#8220;swan theme&#8221; is introduced by horns. As the work reaches its conclusion, this theme transforms into an exultant shout of triumph.</p>



<p>Today, Symphony No. 5 stands not just as a patriotic reminder of Finland&#8217;s nationalistic spirit, but also stands as one of his finest achievements, capturing both the raw beauty of the Finnish landscape and the meditative spirit it inspired in the composer through its now-legendary &#8220;Swan Hymn.&#8221; Its evocation of the majestic swans continues to move listeners decades after its composition.</p>



<p>Experience the unfolding narrative of this symphony as it tells a mosaic story of a composer, his homeland, and the uncontrollable forces of life itself. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Debussy – Jeux (1912) The ballet&#8217;s title tells the story of a boy and two girls searching for&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4 id="debussy-jeux-1912" class="wp-block-heading">Debussy – Jeux (1912)</h4>



<p>The ballet&#8217;s title tells the story of a boy and two girls searching for a tennis ball but ending up playing other games, some childlike and others romantic. It&#8217;s like a musical mystery, where things change and evolve. The main thing I get from this piece is its fleeting nature. Everything seems brief – short motifs, regular tempo changes, and a lack of stability. But somehow, it all feels connected. When listening, I felt that Debussy was trying to convey a sense of childishness – inconsequential, unfocused, and whimsical. But at the same time, it feels sweet, dreamy, and magical. Strangely for a Debussy piece, there&#8217;s not much dissonance.</p>



<h4 id="stravinsky-the-rite-of-spring-1913" class="wp-block-heading">Stravinsky – The Rite of Spring (1913)</h4>



<p>The Rite of Spring is one of my favourite music pieces. I love its intensity, rough rhythms, and surprises. It begins with a beautiful and iconic bassoon at a higher pitch, which clashes with expectations because one would anticipate an oboe or clarinet playing that folk melody. Throughout the piece, there are unexpected dynamics and rhythms, often relying on dissonance and interruptions. I believe Stravinsky intended to provoke and make the listener uncomfortable, evoking a sense of despair similar to a young girl being sacrificed by dancing herself to death. The use of percussion is crucial for the ballet&#8217;s dance aspect and to convey that feeling of unease.</p>



<p>Interestingly, whenever I hear this piece, it reminds me of metal music concerts, where chaos and loud noises reign. In both the Rite of Spring and metal concerts, the percussive element of the instruments is what moves and excites people. It&#8217;s remarkable how this aspect remains unchanged despite the 100-year difference.</p>



<h4 id="schoenberg-pierrot-lunaire-1913" class="wp-block-heading">Schoenberg – Pierrot Lunaire (1913)</h4>



<p>This was the hardest piece to listen to. The Sprechstimme technique goes against what I was expecting for the vocal melody. This creates a spooky and unsettling feeling that I reckon may go along with the story. The harmony in this music doesn&#8217;t follow the traditional rules and doesn&#8217;t have a clear melody or a familiar pattern. Overall, even though it might have been challenging for me to appreciate this unusual music, I believe it may reveal many interesting and thought-provoking structures that when explored more deeply may be surprisingly creative. At the same time, it&#8217;s really hard for me to understand what impact this piece had on the overall music.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Comparing the three, despite being written just one year apart, they are completely different styles. Looking at today&#8217;s music, I find it refreshing to see that there was a time when the best composers were exploring completely different styles. If I were to give these three pieces a personality, I would say that Debussy&#8217;s is more emotional and sensitive, while Stravinsky&#8217;s is more primal and brute. Schoenberg’s is somehow much less earthly, more imaginative, and surreal.</p>

<p>I recently discovered Public Service Broadcasting when I heard their music performed by the 88-piece BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Jules Buckley. I liked it from the start and have been listening to it repeatedly.</p>



<p>I enjoyed how the music remains mostly the same but gradually adds different instruments and textures in a big build-up. </p>



<p>The most surprising aspect for me was the blend of drums and orchestra. I think exploring drums in an orchestral context adds a modern rhythmic element. I also liked the mix of pre-recorded sounds, electronic, and acoustic instruments. They fit together seamlessly, making it hard to distinguish between them.</p>



<p>Overall, it&#8217;s a perfect fusion of pop and classical music, with experimental elements that I appreciate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This course unit was quite challenging, especially since I decided to take on a full-time job alongside my studies. Balancing a full-time job, being a parent, and studying part-time has been quite demanding. As a result, my reflection centres around my perception that I wasn&#8217;t able to go as deeply into the subjects as I would have liked.</p>



<p>I found the first two projects to be incredibly valuable. They kickstarted my reflection on various aspects of music, such as its nature, what constitutes good music, and the differences between popular and classical music. This led me to question many of my preconceived notions.</p>



<p>One thing that pleasantly surprised me in this unit was the diverse range of music I was exposed to. From movie soundtracks to Indian music and contemporary styles I hadn&#8217;t encountered before, it expanded my musical horizons. Since my musical background was one of my main challenges, this exposure was truly beneficial. In hindsight, I think it would have been great to take this course as my first.</p>



<p>But, looking back, I wish I had spent more time on each subject. For example, I had a strong affinity for holy minimalist composers, and I would have loved to explore them further. On the other hand, microtonality and spectralism were not as enjoyable for me. I believe that with more time and study, I might have come to understand and appreciate what these composers are trying to convey.</p>



<p>The projects that focused on the Batman soundtrack and researching Magnus Lindberg were the ones I dedicated the most time to. Perhaps that&#8217;s why I found them particularly rewarding. Both projects allowed me to exercise a skill I had developed in the Stylistic Techniques course: writing about music. In both cases, I aimed to bring my own perspective to the table, going beyond regurgitating information readily available online. I hope I succeeded in conveying my own viewpoint while grounding it in factual information.</p>



<p>When I consider the overall content of the unit, I realize that some projects, such as those on orchestral instruments and music notation, had already been covered in other courses. If this had been my first course, those projects would have been perfect. However, since I had already delved into those topics before, I chose to skip them and dedicate more time to other projects.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I see progression in my studies, particularly in the broadening of my &#8220;musical baggage&#8221;. As for my writing skills, I have discovered that I find reflective texts much easier to write than &#8220;listening&#8221; ones. The most important lesson I have learned thus far is the need to improve my listening skills. I want to write about my experiences with music in a way that is clear, accurate, and captures everything that makes the music special to me.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Religious composers (holy minimalism) John Tavener &#8211; The LambI liked this song. I didn&#8217;t know John Tavener until&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 id="religious-composers-holy-minimalism" class="wp-block-heading">Religious composers (holy minimalism)</h3>



<p><strong>John Tavener &#8211; The Lamb<br></strong>I liked this song. I didn&#8217;t know John Tavener until today, and I was very impressed by this choral piece. It was peaceful, calm, and it seemed to be written to enjoy the echo of a church. This means that I didn&#8217;t feel sudden changes in the voices. Instead, they seemed to float on their own and slowly fade out.</p>



<p><strong>Arvo Pärt &#8211; Spiegel im Spiegel<br></strong>Another piece that I enjoyed, and I didn&#8217;t know the composer. The piano is very simple, but I think its purpose is to allow the violin to express long sustained notes. I can imagine this being played at a church, and the sound echoing through the walls. I have the desire to understand how deeply rooted this song is in Estonian traditional music.</p>



<p><strong>Henryk Górecki &#8211; Symphony No 3<br></strong>The music seems very peaceful but mournful at the same time, especially in the middle of the first movement when the soprano starts singing. I liked that the first half of the first movement seems like it is building up for a big explosion, but it never arrives. Overall, I think this symphony could be a soundtrack for a movie or documentary. I believe Zimmer thought so too.</p>



<h3 id="minimalism" class="wp-block-heading">Minimalism</h3>



<p><strong>Steve Reich &#8211; Music for 18 Musicians<br></strong>I find this type of music harder to enjoy. The simple sound and repetitive nature with subtle changes are not my preference. I understand the exploration of sounds, similar to Ravel&#8217;s Bolero, and can appreciate it to some extent. However, the length of the repetition is too much for me. Listening to it as a whole might induce a trance-like feeling and it made me wonder if this kind of music could also be used for religious purposes.</p>



<p><strong>Terry Riley &#8211; In C<br></strong>I tried to listen attentively to the entire piece, but once again, aside from the interesting exercise, I don&#8217;t find this art form truly enjoyable. What stood out to me was how the introduction of new sounds and instruments took the music on different paths. This was more noticeable when I skipped ahead a few minutes from time to time. I understand that the composer probably didn&#8217;t intend his music to be listened to this way, but for me, it provided a more interesting experience.</p>



<p><strong>Philip Glass &#8211; Glassworks<br></strong>I found this album much easier to appreciate than the previous two. Although there is still repetition, there is a sense of progression. It feels like the music is going somewhere. Some moments reminded me of Radiohead, which added another layer of interest. Another notable aspect of Glass&#8217;s music is the varied tempo compared to the previous pieces, creating interesting contrasts between songs.</p>



<h3 id="new-complexity" class="wp-block-heading">New complexity</h3>



<p><strong>Brian Ferneyhough &#8211; Exordium<br></strong>It&#8217;s difficult for me to write about this piece. I felt uncomfortable at times and wasn&#8217;t sure if I liked it or not. It seemed highly complex and lacked direction after my initial hearing. It felt more like an exploration of sounds rather than a cohesive composition. While I acknowledge that there is certainly thought behind this piece, I couldn&#8217;t fully grasp it.</p>



<h3 id="choral-music-tonality" class="wp-block-heading">Choral music/tonality</h3>



<p><strong>John Rutter &#8211; Requiem<br></strong>All of Rutter&#8217;s Requiem felt accessible to me. Even though I wasn&#8217;t familiar with the artist, there was a sense of déjà vu while listening to the pieces. It reminded me of Górecki, and I could imagine it as a movie soundtrack. The harmonies are simple, and the instrumentation is understated. However, this simplicity doesn&#8217;t diminish the emotional impact. For example, Agnus Dei felt mysterious and sombre to me.</p>



<p><strong>Eric Whitacre &#8211; Cloudburst<br></strong>The introduction was surprising and bewildering, with the gradual rise of all the sounds. I couldn&#8217;t determine if it was purely vocal or if other instruments were involved. I enjoyed how the voices floated at times, each having its own line, but I was even more captivated when they harmonized and created a powerful sonority.</p>



<h3 id="microtonality-and-spectralism" class="wp-block-heading">Microtonality and spectralism</h3>



<p><strong>Tristan Murail &#8211; Allegories<br></strong>I have limited knowledge of microtonality and spectralism, so this is a new experience for me. This particular piece left me uncertain about my feelings by the end. I attempted to identify recurring elements, but I struggled to do so. Instead, I found myself focusing on the electronic sounds and trying to differentiate them from the acoustic sounds. It was challenging for me to discern between the two. I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if this blurring of sounds was intentional on the part of the composer.</p>



<p><strong>Gérard Grisey – Les Espaces Acoustiques<br></strong>The overall pace of the music is slow, but it has a captivating effect. The first piece starts with a beautiful melody played by the viola which I really enjoyed. It had a certain pattern that kept coming back, and I couldn&#8217;t help but focus on it. As the piece progressed, more instruments joined in, which I found less interesting than the solo instrument.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 id="classical-music" class="wp-block-heading">Classical Music</h3>



<p>I haven&#8217;t been into classical music before. As a child, I didn&#8217;t have many chances to experience it, and as I got older, I leaned towards other genres. But since I started this course, my understanding and, consequently, my love for classical music have grown.</p>



<h3 id="contemporary-music" class="wp-block-heading">Contemporary Music</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m not very familiar with this genre, especially contemporary classical music. Nowadays, I don&#8217;t pay as much attention to it as I do to more traditional classical music.</p>



<h3 id="country-music" class="wp-block-heading">Country Music</h3>



<p>As someone who didn&#8217;t grow up in North America, country music did not made part of my listening environment as a child. I&#8217;ve come across some interesting songs, but I haven&#8217;t paid much attention to it. Lately, I&#8217;ve been enjoying the music of Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton.</p>



<h3 id="dance-music" class="wp-block-heading">Dance Music</h3>



<p>I was exposed to this genre a lot while growing up, whether through my brother or from going to nightclubs. However, it never really captured my interest. For me, the intensive repetition of music, with endless loops, bores me. Nevertheless, I do enjoy listening to Prodigy and Fatboy Slim.</p>



<h3 id="early-music" class="wp-block-heading">Early Music</h3>



<p>I have to admit, I didn&#8217;t listen to this genre very often. My main exposure to it was during my studies, when I explored it for academic reasons.</p>



<h3 id="folk-music" class="wp-block-heading">Folk Music</h3>



<p>I enjoy listening to Portuguese Folk Music, but besides my own country&#8217;s folk heritage, I don&#8217;t know much about folk music from around the world. The folk music I am familiar with is mainly from classical compositions that incorporated elements of folk music.</p>



<h3 id="jazz-music" class="wp-block-heading">Jazz Music</h3>



<p>Jazz took some time to grow on me. Initially, I didn&#8217;t have much of an affinity for it. However, as I delved deeper into learning about instruments and music theory, my appreciation for jazz started to blossom. Nowadays, it&#8217;s one of the genres I listen to the most. Stan Getz and Billie Holiday played a significant role in cultivating my love for jazz.</p>



<h3 id="musical-theatre-music" class="wp-block-heading">Musical Theatre Music</h3>



<p>As a child, I didn&#8217;t understand why characters in musical movies suddenly burst into song during conversations. This made me dislike the genre as a whole, including Disney movies. Over time, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate the music itself, but I still don&#8217;t enjoy the theatrical and cinematic elements that accompany it.</p>



<h3 id="opera-music" class="wp-block-heading">Opera Music</h3>



<p>Opera music, like musical theater, presents a similar challenge due to its complexity and occasional intricate ornamentation.</p>



<h3 id="pop-music" class="wp-block-heading">Pop Music</h3>



<p>What&#8217;s not to like in Pop Music? It&#8217;s catchy, easy to listen to, and often uplifting. I like pop music in general, especially when it offers something unique. Current pop artists I admire are Dua Lipa, Lizzo and Mark Ronson.</p>



<h3 id="rnb-music" class="wp-block-heading">R’n’B Music</h3>



<p>I was more exposed to R&#8217;n&#8217;B in the 2000&#8217;s when artists like Alicia Keys and Beyoncé exploded. However, my recent interest has shifted towards 70s music, which features incredible R&#8217;n&#8217;B artists like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder.</p>



<h3 id="rap-music" class="wp-block-heading">Rap Music</h3>



<p>Rap music is a genre that I either really love or strongly dislike. I&#8217;ve listened to a lot of rap music, particularly in the 2000s, which helped me develop an appreciation for artists like Eminem and Outkast. Recently, I&#8217;ve been enjoying De La Soul and The Roots after discovering J Dilla&#8217;s songs.</p>



<h3 id="reggae-music" class="wp-block-heading">Reggae Music</h3>



<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t know much about Reggae beyond Bob Marley. It&#8217;s mostly unfamiliar territory to me.</p>



<h3 id="rock-music" class="wp-block-heading">Rock Music</h3>



<p>In general, my listening attention is divided between Rock and Funk, so it&#8217;s a genre I appreciate a lot. I love the combination of bass, guitar, and drums. It&#8217;s amazing how these instruments can create such great music. I also find it fascinating how Rock has evolved over the years.</p>



<h3 id="soul-music" class="wp-block-heading">Soul Music</h3>



<p>As I&#8217;m getting older, I&#8217;ve been enjoying Soul music more and more. I&#8217;m particularly drawn to Soul songs that feature a strong bass line and keyboard melodies. They grab my attention right away.</p>



<p></p>



<h1 id="exploring-new-music" class="wp-block-heading">Exploring new music</h1>



<h3 id="reggae" class="wp-block-heading">Reggae</h3>



<p><strong>Ini Kamoze &#8211; World A Music</strong></p>



<p>I like how the beats syncopate on the 2nd and 4th. The sound that catches my attention the most is the reverb—it&#8217;s a bit excessive, but it adds that characteristic Reggae touch. The bassline is wonderfully uncomplicated, yet it perfectly complements the overall mood of the song. The vocals have such a relaxed vibe, which again aligns beautifully with the song and the genre. Overall, I really enjoyed it, although I must admit that the repetitive nature can get a bit monotonous after a while.</p>



<p><strong>Freak Out &#8211; Jackie Mittoo</strong></p>



<p>I enjoyed listening to this song. Even though it maintains the characteristic repetitiveness of Reggae, I find that being an instrumental piece adds a refreshing touch. What&#8217;s more, it strikes a perfect balance with the reverb—it&#8217;s not overpowering, and I genuinely appreciate that.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 id="opera" class="wp-block-heading">Opera</h3>



<p><strong>Mark-Anthony Turnage – Lament for a Hanging Man</strong></p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t the kind of opera I was expecting to listen to. Most of the operas I&#8217;ve listened to were composed before the 19th century. But this one, released in 1995, has a more modern vibe. The instruments used in the orchestra are diverse, including saxophones, bass clarinets, and percussion. This creates different sounds and rhythms that sometimes feel energetic and unpredictable, while other times they are more controlled and melodic. Overall, I liked it more than I was expecting. Especially the jazzy parts.</p>



<h3 id="indian" class="wp-block-heading">Indian</h3>



<p><strong>Ravi Shankar – Song From The Hills</strong></p>



<p>Besides the main differences of not having a common Western harmonic development, the difference I found insteresting in this music is the instrumentation. For example, in this piece, they use instruments like the tabla, which is a type of drum that creates rhythmic beats. It adds a lively and energetic feel to the music. There is also a shaking instrument that produces a shaking sound that adds some texture to the overall sound. Personally, I enjoyed listening to this piece and its unique style. However, since it doesn&#8217;t relate directly to my own culture, I couldn&#8217;t connect with it on a deep level. Even though this style of music may not be familiar to us, it can still be enjoyable to listen to and appreciate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Before we dive into the topic, I want to share a quick observation. When I first encountered the term &#8220;contemporary music,&#8221; my immediate thought was about classical contemporary music. However, I questioned myself and wondered why that was the case. What exactly is contemporary music? So, I researched, and the most satisfactory answer for me came from the Berkeley website, which defines contemporary music as an approach rather than a specific genre. It involves creating and performing rhythmically, harmonically, and texturally current music while incorporating diverse influences and cross-pollination of genres (Mirisola, 2019). </p>



<p>Living in Lisbon, a big city, offers many opportunities to enjoy live music by composers who are currently active. The Portuguese music scene is lively right now, with new composers emerging regularly, while still honoring established ones. What&#8217;s interesting is that Portugal, especially Lisbon, is a melting pot of cultures, and this diversity is reflected in the contemporary music scene. It&#8217;s amazing to witness the fusion of hip-hop and classical music, Cape Verdean melodies blending with fado, and even the recent combination of Flamenco and pop music. The physical spaces complement this musical movement, showing the interconnectedness of it all. There are more dedicated venues for contemporary music, both large ones like Centro Cultural de Belém and Gulbenkian, and smaller spaces throughout the city, even the streets themselves become stages for different composers.</p>



<p>Contemporary music analysis can be quite a challenge. We&#8217;ve seen throughout history that time plays a crucial role in determining its true worth. It needs the space to grow and evolve before we can make a fair judgment. That&#8217;s when we can truly grasp what will stand the test of time and hold cultural significance in the future. I understand that contemporary music serves as a mirror of our times, capturing the spirit and emotions of the present era. It thrives on pushing boundaries and challenging conventional norms, constantly evolving to reflect the changing world around us. But at times it may be challenging to fully grasp the intricacies of contemporary music. Whenever I come across contemporary music that doesn&#8217;t conform to the usual standards, my initial reaction tends to be one of hesitation. I find myself wondering if it&#8217;s using certain sounds and techniques just for the sake of it, without a clear purpose. But I make an effort to listen and try to understand its value. Let me share an example: when I first listened to Magnus Lindberg&#8217;s Kraft, I wasn&#8217;t immediately drawn in. It sounded like random noise, I have to admit. However, as I delved deeper into researching the composer, I realized the importance of considering it within the broader musical landscape. But that&#8217;s the analytical side of appreciating music. On an emotional level, I often find that the more unconventional the music, the less it captures my interest.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Magnus Lindberg, born in 1958 in Helsinki, burst onto the global contemporary music scene in the early 80s,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Magnus Lindberg, born in 1958 in Helsinki, burst onto the global contemporary music scene in the early 80s, seamlessly blending different styles, from total serialism to rock.</p>



<p>Finland nurtured his composition career. He joined Sibelius Academy at 15, studying under Paavo Heininen, who fueled his interest in European trends. In 1977, he co-founded Korvat auki with Kaija Saariaho and Esa-Pekka Salonen. In 1980, he founded Toimii Ensemble a creative laboratory that became the birthplace of his innovative compositional experiments.</p>



<p>Mellor (2016) highlights the fascinating evolution of Lindberg&#8217;s compositional style. Over about two decades, he transitioned from an impassioned modernist to a &#8220;mellow composer&#8221; who crafts exquisite orchestral pieces with hints of Romanticism.</p>



<p>After his studies, he travelled to Paris and Berlin, where he discovered punk rock and specifically the German metal band Einstürzende Neubauten. This exposure changed his musical style, turning him into an &#8220;angry modernist,&#8221; (Mellor, 2016) as reflected in his most ambitious composition, Kraft (1985), written for orchestra, electronics, and junkyard percussion. When I heard it, I understood why it is considered such a powerful piece. It radiates tremendous strength, astonishing the listener with its bold changes in dynamics. It brought to mind Stravinsky&#8217;s Rite of Spring, but went even further in terms of instrumentation and a feeling of aggression. While I didn&#8217;t find it as captivating as Rite of Spring overall, there were elements, particularly at the start of each section, that I enjoyed.</p>



<p>In 1994, he composed Aura, a symphony in four movements for a large orchestra. As I listened to each part, I noticed something unexpected—it seemed closer to Rite of Spring rather than moving further away. Interestingly, I even recognized a hint of the famous Rite of Spring rhythm around the ninth minute of the first movement in the recording by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. On the whole, there is a sense of clarity, balance, and harmony that sharply contrasts with Kraft. If I had to guess how Lindberg&#8217;s sound would evolve ten years after Kraft, I would have imagined a greater emphasis on electronic elements rather than acoustic ones. This pleasant surprise increased my admiration for Aura.</p>



<p>In 2002, he created the Clarinet Concerto, which garnered positive reviews from the critics I read. Surprisingly, it is his most popular piece on Spotify. And I can see why. Compared to the previous two compositions, this piece felt more approachable, melodious, and well-structured. The instrumentation has a more traditional quality. It felt like a refined version of Aura. According to Clemments (2005), this single-movement work is sprinkled with allusions to other composers. Although I may not possess the musical knowledge to identify them, I was delighted to recognize the reference to Gershwin&#8217;s Rhapsody in Blue. Actually, that was my favourite part of this piece.</p>



<p>Overall, I was delighted to meet Magnus Lindberg. One thing that stood out in the compositions I listened to was his ability to combine tension/release. His music slowly builds up suspense, and then it bursts forth with pure joy. But what matters to me is how this demonstrates that artists can evolve and freely change their sound without being tied to a specific style. It reminded me of an interview with Rosalía where she says that she couldn&#8217;t do two similar albums because she desires to showcase her diverse emotions across different moments in time. It&#8217;s truly a testament to artistic evolution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tchaikovsky&#8217;s Seasons is probably the less known &#8220;seasons&#8221; of major composers. My opinion is that, because they were composed for a bigger audience, including amateurs, they lack the virtuosity and complexity that pianists prefer in order to showcase their skills.</p>



<p>The collection was composed between November 1875 and May 1876 and commissioned by Nikolay Matveyevich Bernard, the publisher of Le Nouvelliste, a monthly music magazine in St. Petersburg. The intention of the publisher was to release one piece per month, but Tchaikovsky wrote the majority of the pieces between April and May 1876.</p>



<p>In opposition to Vivaldi&#8217;s &#8220;The Four Seasons&#8221;, Tchaikovsky&#8217;s seasons are composed of 12 pieces, each one dedicated to each month of the year, showcasing a glimpse of something characteristic of the month, for example, Carnival (February), The Harvest (August) or Christmas (December).</p>



<p>I would not say that this romantic work is programmatic, but one cannot definitely distance himself from the theme of each piece and hear it as absolute music.</p>



<p>My thoughts after listening to each piece:</p>



<ul>
<li>January: Warm, cosy, and familiar, Evokes a feeling of being at home with the cold outside, warmed by a fireplace and surrounded by loved ones.</li>



<li>February: Playful, cheery, festive. Just like Carnival should be.</li>



<li>March: Melancholic and distant, evoking a sense of reflection for the cold month of March.</li>



<li>April: Charming and optimistic. The end of winter means the start of spring.</li>



<li>May: Serene and tranquil, but warm just like the nights of May.</li>



<li>June: There&#8217;s a certain melancholy in this piece that I find beautiful. It looks like a very romantic piece.</li>



<li>July: The summer spirit is present with a catchy and cheerful tone.</li>



<li>August: The initial and final sections of this piece weren&#8217;t to my liking. It feels chaotic and excessively flourishing for my taste.</li>



<li>September: Majestic and spirited. It resembles a fanfare that complements the eerie ambience of this time of year.</li>



<li>October: Among the pieces in this set, this one evokes a particularly somber mood, but is my favourite. Winter is coming.</li>



<li>November: Somehow, the beggining, reminds me of impressionist pieces. It showcases familiar tunes and notable variations.</li>



<li>December: A refined and courteous waltz-like composition, that brings a warm and festive sensation.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, I think Tchaikovsky successfully captured the essence of each month, while also preserving a sense of coherence throughout the entire composition. It was a fantastic initial listening, and I eagerly anticipate revisiting it in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dark Knight, the second film of the Dark Knight Trilogy, is one of my favourite movies. The reason I love it is that it portrays both the hero and villain as flawed, human characters with blurred lines between good and bad. However, I had never watched it with a focus on the music until now.</p>



<p>Composed by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, the music beautifully captures the duality of the characters. Acoustic instruments (mostly orchestral instruments) dominate when Bruce Wayne appears, while electronic instruments (ranging from electric guitars to synthesizers and audio effects) take over when Batman is present. This stark contrast creates a tranquil atmosphere for Bruce and intense action sequences for Batman.</p>



<p>Intense scenes often feature string ostinati or percussive 16th-note rhythms. Ostinati create sonic continuity when using shorter note values and busy rhythms, they enhance forward momentum and drive.</p>



<p>Despite the complex character development, the main characters&#8217; motifs are remarkably simple. Batman&#8217;s motif consists of two notes (D-F), and the Joker&#8217;s motif is a single note (D). These motifs are strategically used throughout the film to highlight each character&#8217;s presence and convey their essence.</p>



<p>Batman&#8217;s motif, often played by brass with digital effects, brings brightness and hope. It signifies his moments of triumph, like emerging unscathed from the Batmobile crash. On the other hand, the Joker&#8217;s motif, a single note played by a processed cello and razorblade-driven electric guitar, creates a nervy, unsettling feeling akin to an ever-present mosquito. Sometimes the note ascends aimlessly over the D drone, capturing Joker&#8217;s anarchist mindset.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="194" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-1024x194.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1596" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-1024x194.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-300x57.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-768x146.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-640x121.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-960x182.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49.png 1298w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The film&#8217;s core message is that Batman and the Joker are not as different as they seem. Analyzing these motifs made me realize that musically they are related as well.  Both motifs start with the same note, D, but Batman&#8217;s controlled ascent to F contrasts with the Joker&#8217;s anarchic, uncontrollable rise.</p>



<p>This exercise was enjoyable, and it sparked my interest in analyzing how Batman and his villains have been musically portrayed over time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Japanese traditional music, also called hōgaku, is generally defined as all Japanese musical forms from the 10th century,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Japanese traditional music, also called <em>hōgaku</em>, is generally defined as all Japanese musical forms from the 10th century, until the introduction of Western music. But the consensus is that the term <em>hōgaku</em> refers to traditional Japanese music made during or after Japan’s Edo Period (17th to mid-19th centuries) (Sonosky, 2013).</p>



<p>During my research, I found an article by Britten Dean (1985) that discusses Japanese traditional music. According to Dean, unfamiliar Western listeners often perceive it as monotonous, aimless, and shrill. The author attributes this perception to five main differences compared to Western music: monophony, scales, noise, singing, and subtlety. While a detailed explanation can be found in the article, a brief overview is enough to grasp the essential elements of this style.</p>



<p>Traditional Japanese instrumental music features unique instruments such as koto, shamisen (strings meant to be plucked), shakuhachi, fue, shinobue (types of flute), and percussion instruments like shimedaiko, okawa, and kotsuzumi.</p>



<p>Dean mentions that Japanese traditional music follows a long tradition of having a single melody without supporting chords. This can make the music seem thin and lack the progressive harmony that Western listeners expect. It may give the impression of simplicity, but an example provided by the author illustrates the complexity of a single melody. At times, the voice and accompaniment play the same melody but are intentionally desynchronized by a half-beat.</p>



<p>According to Dean, Japanese traditional music primarily relies on the pentatonic scale. This scale is evident in instruments like the five-hole shakuhachi and the tuning of the koto strings. Variations of the pentatonic scale (perhaps the equivalent of Western music modes) often result in a wider interval between the last note of the scale and the tonic, exceeding a whole step. Consequently, the prominence of the leading note is not as anticipated, giving the music a sense of lacking progression and purpose.</p>



<p>Dean also explores the idea of noise, highlighting its contrasting use in Japanese traditional music compared to Western music. While noise is typically avoided in Western music, it serves as an artistic expression in Japanese traditional music. For instance, when the shamisen&#8217;s string is struck by the plectrum, a subtle clicking sound is produced. Contemporary composers even push the boundaries by incorporating intentional beating and pounding of instruments to create a diverse range of sounds. Although these sounds may appear dissonant, they harmoniously blend with the music and are aesthetically pleasing.</p>



<p>Japanese traditional music is also known for its prominent vocal element, as the majority of compositions are sung. Unlike in Western music, Japanese singers do not focus on projecting their voices because there are fewer accompanying instruments. Furthermore, a convention dictates that singers should refrain from showing their teeth. As a result, Japanese singing is characterized by a gentle delivery and a narrower range of vocal dynamics compared to Western music.</p>



<p>Finally, subtlety is a prominent aspect of Japanese traditional music. In the past, hōgaku was intended for intimate settings with small audiences in compact spaces. As a result, the contrast in volume is minimized, and the extremes of the dynamic range are consciously avoided. This creates a sense of consistent and stable music, where the surprises lie within the subtle details.</p>



<p>In the end, I came to understand that while these features strongly contrast with Western music, there is one aspect that stands out as even more remarkable and contrasting. Traditional Japanese music has remained nearly unchanged for nine centuries, while Western music has undergone constant evolution. This leads me to believe it is a music deeply rooted in tradition, embracing gradual enhancements, and upholding a profound reverence for past composers.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Having familiarized myself with the notable aspects of hōgaku, I am now able to appreciate them through actual listening, as demonstrated in the aforementioned example. Sankyoku, a musical form involving a koto player who also sings, accompanied by a samisen and a shakuhachi, allows me to perceive the delicacy, ethereal quality, seemingly spontaneous nature, and monophonic texture. Moreover, I find it intriguing to observe the lack of synchronization between the vocals and instruments, a detail that had previously eluded my attention.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>After exploring additional compositions, I discovered that hōgaku possesses a wonderful sense of serenity, seriousness, and contemplation while maintaining a delicate balance and lightness.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There is no music that can be classified as inherently good or bad. In my perspective, art defies&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is no music that can be classified as inherently good or bad. In my perspective, art defies the notion of being labelled as incorrect. Poems, dances, sculptures—they can&#8217;t be deemed as wrong. The same applies to music; there is no right or wrong. Its value lies in the connection it forges with the listener. Interestingly, this notion was shared with me by a 19-year-old person I had a conversation. When I inquired about their perception of good and bad pop music, they responded by saying that good music must have a captivating rhythm and powerful meaning to themselves.</p>



<p>Considering this, it is really hard for me to tell what makes pop music good or bad. However, it is easier for me to distinguish between pop music I feel is relevant to me and the ones that don&#8217;t.</p>



<p>A truly good or relevant pop song must possess a blend of remarkable melodies, seamless harmonic progressions, grab the listeners&#8217; attention in the first seconds, and incorporate repetition. Above all, it should offer a touch of innovation, presenting a fresh perspective to the realm of music, thereby paving the way for future compositions.</p>



<p>My favourite example of pop music is Queen&#8217;s Bohemian Rhapsody. Despite being classified as Rock Music, it is also recognized as Progressive Pop due to its incorporation of various features from the Progressive Rock genre, including dramatic contrasts and frequent tempo shifts. Astonishingly, they managed to merge the three distinct sections of the song seamlessly, resulting in a cohesive piece with catchy melodies, captivating instrumentals, and powerful lyrics. For that reason, it is regarded as one of the most important songs of all time. Each time I listen to it, I am amazed by how effortlessly they transition between sections while still maintaining their distinctiveness. Furthermore, it has another remarkable feature for a pop song: it clocks in at nearly 6 minutes, yet it never feels lengthy.</p>



<p>Another example of excellent pop music, though in a contrasting genre, is Los Del Rio&#8217;s Macarena, specifically the Bayside Boys remix. This song epitomizes pop music at its finest. It dominated the charts in 1996 and even secured the No. 7 spot on Billboard&#8217;s All-Time Top 100 in 2012. With its catchy melody, simple two-chord harmony, and a blend of clave rhythm and techno beats, this song is undeniably pop. The Spanish-English lyrics are lively and empowering to women, contributing to the girl power movement alongside the Spice Girls. Furthermore, it had a lasting impact on Latin music for years to come. While it may not align with my taste nor be a song I would listen to repeatedly, I acknowledge that it possesses all the qualities of exceptional pop music.</p>



<p>A more recent example of great pop music is SZA&#8217;s Kill Bill, released in 2022. This song was an immediate success, spending 19 weeks in the top three of Billboard&#8217;s Hot 100. Its most remarkable aspect is the contrast of a truly beautiful melody with dark lyrics. This contrast is enhanced by an exquisite introduction, a captivating boom-bap rhythm, and simple harmonies. The song, superficially, sounds like a simple pop song but going into the complex composition, we find that it deviates from the typical structure and incorporates intentionally off-key instruments. It is this innovative compositional work that attracts me to the song, and it will likely serve as a trendsetter for similar music in the future.</p>



<p>Conversely, bad or irrelevant pop music is predictable, recycling previous musical forms, and attempting to ride the success trends of its time. In other words, it becomes excessively formulaic.</p>



<p>A recent example of a poor pop song is Meghan Trainor&#8217;s Mother. Following the success of her earlier hit, All About That Bass, which showcased innovative lyrics and messaging, Trainor attempted to replicate that triumph by creating a song that adheres almost identically to the formula of her previous success. It features the same rhythm, and excessively polished sound, and utilizes a familiar melody to increase its appeal. As a result, it comes across as mechanically produced, lacking the artist&#8217;s artistic vision, ultimately rendering it disposable.</p>



<p>Another instance is Rebecca Black&#8217;s Friday. Although it achieved tremendous popularity, it is widely regarded as one of the worst-recorded songs. The lyrics are superficial, the vocals are heavily processed with autotune, and the instrumentation feels synthetic. It is a song that becomes predictable from the very beginning and, in my opinion, it remains relevant today, but solely for its negative quality.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I believe that there are no inherently good or bad songs. However, certain characteristics differentiate the significance and relevance of music throughout the history of pop music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Composed in 1888, Gymnopédie No. 1 is one of three piano pieces. The term &#8220;gymnopédie&#8221; refers to a dance performed by young men in ancient Greece, characterized by their nudity. Satie&#8217;s music beautifully captures a sense of ethereal beauty and melancholic nostalgia.</p>



<p>As I learned in my previous studies, Satie influenced Debussy in rejecting the conventions and rules of the era. Gymnopédie No. 1 holds great historical significance as it marked a departure from the prevailing Romantic style of that time.</p>



<p>The composition revolves around a single musical idea, depicted in the image below. To me, it resembles a steady heartbeat that pervades the entire piece, setting its rhythm and atmosphere. Throughout the composition, I anticipated an eruption or a contrasting texture, like in Debussy&#8217;s Clair de Lune, but it never arrived. Even the melody lacks such contrast, with the only variety stemming from the harmony.</p>

<p>Interestingly, upon initial listening, the melody seems simplistic and somewhat predictable, while the harmonies are surprisingly unexpected. Although I couldn&#8217;t find a tonal centre, the music appears to shift between D Major and G Major, introducing delightful contrasts, such as the A minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-14.40.42-1024x565.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1547" width="512" height="283" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-14.40.42-1024x565.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-14.40.42-300x166.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-14.40.42-768x424.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-14.40.42-640x353.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-14.40.42-960x530.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-14.40.42.png 1228w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure>



<p>After several listens, I find the music to be ethereal, creating a contemplative and soothing experience. The choice of the piano as the instrument contributes to this sensation, as it conveys tranquillity more effectively than an orchestra, such as Debussy&#8217;s orchestration. The absence of a narrative or progression in the music makes me wonder whether Satie paved the way for ambient music.<br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Defining pop music proves to be a more challenging task compared to defining classical music. The scope of&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Defining pop music proves to be a more challenging task compared to defining classical music. The scope of classical music encompasses a wide range of definitions. For instance, Oxford Dictionaries defines classical music as &#8220;music written in a Western musical tradition, usually using an established form (for example a symphony).&#8221; Personally, I perceive classical music in a broader sense, encompassing compositions performed by traditional acoustic instruments without a vocal melody. On the contrary, pop music transcends the confines of a singular genre. Pop music, at its core, is music that is appreciated by a mass audience. When looking at the Music Genres Wikipedia entry, we discover that popular music encompasses numerous genres, with pop music serving as a sub-genre with dozens of genres in itself. As a result, the genres that constitute pop music have undergone continuous evolution since the mid-1950s. For instance, during the 1950s, rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll dominated the pop music scene, while in the early 1990s, Latin music took centre stage, and in the late 2000s, dance music emerged as a prominent force.</p>



<p>The main clash in the definition of pop and classical music is highlighted in the Oxford Dictionary of Music. According to the dictionary, &#8220;since the late 1950s (&#8230;) pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus[ic]&#8221; (Kennedy, 1994:686). This definition raises intriguing questions. Does it imply that there are only two distinct genres of music? Does it suggest that classical music can never attain the status of popular music?</p>



<p>Among the various articles I read on this topic, the one written by James O. Young, titled &#8220;How Classical Music is Better than Popular Music&#8221; (2016)  struck a chord with me. Although I must admit that I do not agree with the title, I agree with the article&#8217;s main argument. Young states that, in general, classical music is more expressive than pop music because it possesses more expressive resources. Classical compositions often boast a broader range of harmonic resources, including complex chord progressions, intricate counterpoint, and rich orchestration, thereby increasing their potential for &#8220;psychological insight and profundity&#8221; (Young, 2016).</p>



<p>For me, Young&#8217;s perspective can be summarized as variety.  Classical compositions tend to have fewer repetitions and more unexpected progressions compared to popular music. Given that the latter is tailored to a wide audience, it&#8217;s unsurprising that they have more repetitions and basic harmonic structures to make it easier to listen, memorize and enjoy. That makes me wonder if this is why modulation is becoming rarer in popular music.</p>



<p>Given this, it&#8217;s not surprising that classical music is frequently seen as superior to popular music. Usually, people tend to think that complex works are better than simpler ones, but this is a subjective belief that might not be entirely accurate. Creating something simple that resonates with a wide audience is a difficult task, and creating complexity just for the sake of it might not turn it into an interesting work.</p>



<p>When it comes to art, I tend to appreciate simpler works. I truly believe that simple art is not an easy art. When faced with Rococo architecture and Bauhaus buildings, my preference leans towards the latter. The same with painting, poetry and music. I find it truly captivating when an artist can express their perspectives and emotions through the simplicity of their art, thereby engaging a wider audience that may otherwise be pushed away from complexity.</p>



<p>In summary, I don&#8217;t believe that the question of good and bad music applies to a discussion about what differentiates popular music and classical music. These are two music genres, each encompassing multiple subgenres, with unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Classical music is expected to exhibit greater expressiveness, diversity, and intellectual depth. Popular music is expected to have the ability to appeal to a large audience and to be more accessible to composers. Given the choice, I would opt for pop music due to its democratic nature, benefiting both composers and listeners.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Trying to define music is a rabbit hole that many musicologists, ethnomusicologists, philosophers, musicians, music students, and others&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trying to define music is a rabbit hole that many musicologists, ethnomusicologists, philosophers, musicians, music students, and others alike, have fallen. Researching through Google and the UCA Library has confirmed this observation. The nature of music is inherently subjective, and it is as hard as attempting to define any other form of art.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it is a great exercise to do, especially when starting this unit.</p>



<p>To kick off this exercise, I went into the world of other people&#8217;s music definitions. I hopped from dictionary entries to books, interviews, essays, and opinion articles. Among the definitions I found, some were analytical and detached, such as the Concise Oxford Dictionary&#8217;s description as &#8220;the art of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion.&#8221; Other definitions had a philosophical tone, such as Beethoven&#8217;s perspective that &#8220;Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy.&#8221; I also encountered spiritual viewpoints, like Charlie Parker&#8217;s belief that &#8220;Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom.&#8221; I even came across thought-provoking definitions, such as Frank Zappa&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;Anything can be music.&#8221;</p>



<p>This helped form my own opinion about how I would define music. </p>



<p>Music can be characterized by elements that are relatively easier to define, such as rhythm, melody, and harmony. These components are concrete, measurable, and easy to categorize. And we can indeed say that if these elements are present, it can be identified as music. However, deep down, I intuitively know that music is much more than the sum of those elements. Music transcends the boundaries of its components. So, what is music?</p>



<p>In order for music to exist, it requires three essential participants: the composer, the performer, and the listener. Interestingly, these roles can sometimes be fulfilled by the same person. Think of a pianist improvising alone in a room. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the composer and performer don&#8217;t need to be exclusively human. Take the example of a bird joyfully singing its song. Yet, when it comes to the listener in this trio, it must be a human being. A bird cannot claim to be truly listening to music, as it lacks the rational capacity to understand the emotional impact behind the composition and performance. Only a human listener has the rational ability to identify and appreciate the emotional effect that those sounds, can have. Thus, I maintain that the definition of music is largely shaped by the listener rather than just by the sounds.</p>



<p>Of course, it is fair to say that this definition could be challenged, considering that people who are deaf cannot physically hear music. However, they possess the remarkable ability to perceive and discern the presence of music through alternative means, such as vibrations. That is precisely why I intentionally used the term &#8220;listen&#8221; instead of &#8220;hear.&#8221; A deaf person can listen to music by other meanings other than using their ears. </p>



<p>If I were to draft an analytical and impartial definition of music, it would say that music is a compilation of sounds crafted by a composer and executed by a performer, which holds emotional significance for a human listener.</p>



<p>However, personally, I find myself drawn to a definition that carries a touch more spirit. Ultimately, I gravitate towards the perspective offered by Frank Zappa. I would say that music is anything that the listener decides is music.</p>
