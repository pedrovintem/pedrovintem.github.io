<p>This assignment compares the Missa Brevis by two composers, Palestrina and Zoltán Kodály. Additionally, it examines Max Richter&#8217;s reinterpretation of Vivaldi&#8217;s Four Seasons in his work, Vivaldi Recomposed.</p>



<h5 id="part-1" class="wp-block-heading">Part 1</h5>



<p>To compare the Missa Brevis by Palestrina and Zoltán Kodály, I listened to The Tallis Scholars&#8217; recording of Palestrina&#8217;s Mass, directed by Peter Phillips, and to the Warsaw Philharmonic Choir&#8217;s performance of Kodály&#8217;s Mass directed by Bartosz Michałowski.</p>



<p>Palestrina&#8217;s Missa Brevis exemplifies the Renaissance style. Composed for four voices sometime in the mid-16th century, it adheres to the principles of counterpoint, with melodic lines weaving together seamlessly. The focus is on vocal clarity and a sense of serenity. Palestrina&#8217;s textures are predominantly smooth, with a balance between polyphony and homophony, usually manifesting at the final cadence. The overall effect is one of meditative beauty, drawing the listener into a realm of introspection. Palestrina&#8217;s works were typically performed with no accompaniment in large, resonant spaces, allowing the polyphonic textures to blend and create a sense of reverence and spaciousness.</p>



<p>Kodály&#8217;s Missa Brevis for solo voices, chorus, and organ, was composed during World War II (1942-44), reflecting a contrasting world. It is imbued with significance, having premiered in the cloakroom of Budapest&#8217;s Opera House. Subtitled “in tempore belli” (“in times of war”), it was written, at least in part, during the Budapest siege. This sense of despair is infused in the composition through the use of dissonances and the interaction between the voices. Kodály&#8217;s Missa Brevis is more outward-looking, with a sense of energy and drama that contrasts with Palestrina&#8217;s introspective nature. It also distances itself from Palestrina&#8217;s Mass by incorporating more rhythmic vitality and a greater emphasis on the expressive potential of the human voice.</p>



<p>In terms of tonality, it is centred on D and its structure forms an arch, a nineteenth-century structural principle (Pickar, 1985), with extensive use of thematic transformation: the Adagio ‘Qui tollis’ from the Gloria returns at the start of the Agnus Dei. A variation of the entire Kyrie is employed for the ‘Dona nobis pacem’. The cadences feel more unexpected than those found in Palestrina&#8217;s compositions.</p>



<p>Despite their stylistic differences, both composers share a common core. They adhere to the traditional structure of the Mass Ordinary, comprising sections like Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Benedictus, and Agnus Dei, although Kodály adds an introductory section (Introitus) and a final section (Ite, Missa Est). They also employ the traditional Latin text of the Mass. Kodály&#8217;s Missa Brevis features plainchant-style melodies similar to Palestrina but mixed with modal keys reminiscent of the Hungarian folk tradition.</p>



<p>Being passionate about WWII history, Kodály&#8217;s Mass naturally feels more interesting to me. Its historical importance attracted me right away, but so did the sound of it. It feels more explorative than Palestrina&#8217;s, even while following an established structure. The beginning of Gloria is a great example of unexpected fanfare-like figures. The interaction between the voices, almost like a dialogue, appeals to me more. The drama, the use of dissonance, and the unexpected cadences also draw me toward Kodály&#8217;s Mass.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I feel that Kodaly&#8217;s Mass is rooted in tonality and isn&#8217;t as challenging to the ear as other contemporary musical pieces, such as Bartók&#8217;s. This made me appreciate the music more. Perhaps it was Kodaly&#8217;s background as a music educator that led him to make a more accessible Mass, or maybe he aimed to create a Mass that would reach a broader audience and bring peace and hope in a post-war setting.&#8221;</p>

<h5 id="part-2" class="wp-block-heading">Part 2</h5>



<p>Vivaldi Recomposed is a piece composed by Max Richter in 2011, where he proposed to pick up the essence of Vivaldi’s Four Seasons and imbue it with a contemporary sound (Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons recomposed by Max Richter [Streaming], 2014). But rather than merely rearranging Vivaldi’s composition to mirror the modern aesthetic, Richter deconstructs the original piece. He isolates its fundamental elements—themes, harmonies, and rhythms—and reassembles them, allowing the work to resonate deeply with today’s audiences. This analysis examines the Winter Concerto to understand how Richter creates a fresh sound while using earlier material.</p>



<p>Before looking into the piece, it’s crucial to understand that Richter, like any composer, did not create in isolation. His work is a product of the 21st-century context. This implies that both he and his audience are familiar with Vivaldi’s Four Seasons since it is one of the most popular classical pieces in the world. Moreover, composers who emerged after Vivaldi introduced new techniques and sounds, influencing Richter’s compositions.</p>



<p>This influence is evident in the first segment of Winter 1. The first 22 bars mirror exactly Vivaldi’s Winter First Movement. However, Richter introduces a new technique. He instructs all the strings to use Ponticello, see Fig. 1, generating a shivering and harsh sound. While Ponticello was used occasionally in the Baroque period, it was only during the Romantic Period that Ponticello evolved into a significant expressive tool, rather than merely a unique sound effect (Greenfield, 2017). The effect is particularly pronounced in the solo violin, which produces a sound that is significantly colder and more glass-like than Vivaldi’s.</p>

Bars 1-4)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Richter’s usage of dynamics also diverges from Vivaldi’s. Where Vivaldi maintains a constant mezzo-forte until the crescendo for a forte before the main them, Richter engages in a dynamic fluctuation, repeatedly crescendo from pianissimo to mezzo-forte or forte, see Fig. 2, before each of solo violin line. This manipulation of dynamics enhances the overall texture and emotional depth of the piece, underpinning Richter’s vision.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most thrilling aspect of Richter&#8217;s Winter 1 is his approach to reconfiguring Vivaldi’s most recognisable passage of the movement. Richter decided to extract a beat from the main theme, transitioning from a 4/4 to a 7/16 time signature, see Fig. 3. This imparts an unexpected sound to a familiar part of the music. It renders the music rapid, restless, and somewhat sloppy, effectively conveying the sensation of someone running on ice and occasionally slipping.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="897" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.25.23-1024x897.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1982" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.25.23-1024x897.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.25.23-300x263.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.25.23-768x673.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.25.23-1536x1346.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.25.23-640x561.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.25.23-960x841.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.25.23.png 1616w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig 3 (Max Richter&#8217; Vivaldi Recomposed: Winter 1.

<p>The rest of the first movement repeats this progression and rhythm until the end. The constant repetition of Vivaldi&#8217;s selected material is a hallmark of Richter&#8217;s recomposition, which one can understand comes from his minimalistic roots. Or perhaps it is so the work is more appealing to modern ears. In this case, in particular, he repeats the chord progression that moves in 4ths, see Fig 4. (which Vivaldi already used). This is a progression that has been extensively used in modern pop music, and the repetition likely satisfies the sensibilities of contemporary audiences.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="398" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.29.49-1024x398.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1983" style="width:640px;height:auto" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.29.49-1024x398.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.29.49-300x117.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.29.49-768x299.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.29.49-1536x597.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.29.49-640x249.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.29.49-960x373.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.29.49.png 1954w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig 4 (Max Richter&#8217; Vivaldi Recomposed: Winter 1. Bars 39-46)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The second movement, &#8220;Winter 2,&#8221; is impressive in its simplicity and coldness. Here, Richter utilizes two of Vivaldi&#8217;s original materials &#8211; the melody, which is almost the same as the original except for some additional tremolos and brief skipping of notes, and the drone of the viola, which he multiplies across all the strings. This seems a Richter stylistic trace, reminiscent of his piece &#8220;A Sudden Manhattan of the Mind,&#8221; where a drone harmony (played by synths in this case) creates a soundscape for the violin to display its melody.</p>



<p>The harmonic inaction evokes a sensation of stillness, coldness, and sadness, which contrasts with Vivaldi&#8217;s programmatic feeling of pleasure in getting warm inside through a crackling fire. This is perhaps the most impressive feature of Richter&#8217;s recomposition &#8211; using almost identical material (in this case, the melody and drone) to convey a completely different, and in fact, opposing emotional experience.</p>



<p>Allowing for an almost static harmony gives solo performers significant creative expression, particularly in live performances, where the tempo can be stretched or reduced without impacting the accompaniment. This aspect hints at Richter’s dedication to continue Vivaldi’s legacy of showcasing musical virtuosity.</p>



<p>In Winter 3 there’s Richter&#8217;s signature style of stability, defined by Ross (2023), when he writes “Richter’s pieces usually wind up not far from where they began”. This movement evokes a sense of a vast, seemingly unchanging landscape, subtly layered with the introduction of individual elements, one at a time, without any dramatic harmonic or rhythmic shifts. This aligns perfectly with Szabo&#8217;s definition of minimalism: &#8220;uniform, predictable, and understated music; lacking in abrupt changes of instrumentation or volume, devoid of harmonic or rhythmic surprises&#8221; (Ross, 2023). Here, Richter unquestionably embraces a minimalist approach to Vivaldi’s material.</p>



<p>He steers away from Vivaldi&#8217;s programmatic movement, creating an enigmatic soundscape that feels perpetually unsettled. While a subtle programmatic hint lingers through the repeated descending scales in the violas, in red in Fig. 5, suggesting a sensation of constant falling, the solo violin&#8217;s unending ostinatos (green) and contrabass drone (blue) establish an ethereal atmosphere that defies a strictly programmatic interpretation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="411" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-1024x411.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1984" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-1024x411.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-300x120.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-768x308.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-1536x617.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-2048x822.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-640x257.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57-960x385.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-22.40.57.png 3024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fig 4 (Max Richter&#8217; Vivaldi Recomposed: Winter 3. Bars 49-60)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another noteworthy distinction is Richter&#8217;s omission of the unexpected pauses and changes of mood employed by Vivaldi in his third movement. Here, the rhythm persists uniformly throughout, further emphasising the minimalist avoidance of rhythmic surprises.</p>



<p>The ending of the movement fades out rather than resolving with a definitive cadence, a technique prevalent in many popular songs, particularly those from the latter half of the 20th century (Weir, 2014). This is particularly intriguing for a piece&#8217;s final resolution. One traditionally anticipates a conclusive ending, mirroring Vivaldi&#8217;s approach. Here, however, Richter offers a gentle, introspective, and open-ended conclusion.</p>



<p>Upon revisiting Vivaldi Recomposed, it becomes evident that Richter&#8217;s process involved more than simply layering new material upon Vivaldi&#8217;s foundation. Notably, Richter introduces no entirely new melodies. Instead, he employs a technique of repetition, similar to looping and sampling – a decidedly modern soundscape. Through this approach, Richter creates a piece that bridges the centuries, fostering a dialogue between an old work and the present day. This strategy allows Richter to both preserve and redefine Vivaldi&#8217;s composition, ensuring its continued relevance and connection with contemporary audiences.</p>

<p>The Renaissance and Baroque eras are not my favorite musical periods. While I recognise their importance to music history, the complexity of the contrapuntal music and the strict adherence to forms are two aspects that put me off. However, I found it extremely useful to gain knowledge of forms, instruments, techniques and composers of these eras.</p>



<p>One particular sound that doesn’t appeal to me in these periods is sacred music, especially because of its stillness, slow rhythms, and the echoing polyphony of the voices. I&#8217;ve tried to listen to several pieces, and this unit was helpful in that regard as well, but I still struggle to find pleasure in listening to them. That was until I listened to Kodály’s Missa Brevis. That was a real pleasure to listen to. Although it had the same slowness of a Renaissance style, it had a lot of dissonance that I felt adds a lot more drama and spice.</p>



<p>Reflecting and researching dissonance was interesting to the point that I’ve been much more drawn to dissonant sounds since I started my degree than ever before. I now appreciate dissonance as a spice in food. Too much can distract from the main flavours (meaning harmony and melody), but too little can make it bland and predictable. In the case of Kodály’s Missa Brevis, I felt that the dissonances were just right in making serene music sound more dramatic.</p>



<p>I feel that this unit’s assignment was when I explored more of one of the things I love most about the arts, and music in particular. I love to explore how modern artists are influenced by past artists, especially in popular music. I find a special pleasure in identifying little influences in modern compositions that can relate directly to previous artists and understanding how contemporary artists add to that. But to do this, it&#8217;s better to have a deep understanding of music history as a whole, and that’s how I found this unit to be so useful.</p>



<p>Reflecting and understanding musical patronage was another topic I found very interesting in this unit. I find it especially important right now, in a moment when there’s a big discussion about payment models for artists, since streaming services pay so little and music publishers seem to favor those artists who are profitable in terms of live music. This leaves emerging artists out of the way to have financial support to pursue their music.</p>



<p>Although I like the historical and theoretical part of music, I miss composition a lot. I believe that this unit, and this course in general, would benefit from having a strong mix of theory and practical composition throughout the units.</p>



<p>I end this unit still mixing up a little between the eras. It’s much easier and intuitive for me to discern between Classical and Romantic than it is to discern Classical from Baroque and Renaissance. I believe I should work more on this in future units during my degree.</p>



<p>Overall, this unit helped a lot to contextualise music historically and idiomatically, although I believe I need further studying in order to gain a deep understanding of each musical era.</p>

<p>By my tutor&#8217;s suggestion, I heard the work Wendy Carlos did with the Clockwork Orange soundtrack and was amazed by the mixture of classical and electronic music, especially with Beethoven&#8217;s 9th symphony.</p>



<p>From my research, Carlos was one of the pioneers of synthesizers, working with Robert Moog to develop the famous Moog synthesizer. She launched the hugely controversial Switched-on Bach album with music by Bach performed on a Moog synthesizer. Later, she continued combining synthesized and classical music, and she combined Beethoven&#8217;s 9th Symphony with a new hardware that converted the human voice into electronic signals and would later be famously known as a vocoder.</p>



<p>This is the work that ended up in Clockwork Orange&#8217;s soundtrack and has an important role in it. Beethoven&#8217;s music works as a leitmotif for the main character, Alex, and violence. In the beginning, the music is acoustic, but after Alex&#8217;s shock therapy, the music is synthesized. The effect on the listener is quite radical and direct. What was once familiar, rooted in the past, and established, turns into a weird, futuristic, and almost childish sound. The vocoder works perfectly into making the famous choir turn into robots, which can be seen as a direct relation to what happens on screen: the deviant character is forced into normalcy.</p>



<p>Musically speaking, I really enjoyed listening to it. The sound sounds fresh even though it was composed in 1972, but that&#8217;s no surprise because synthesizers and vocoders are more and more common in contemporary music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I heard this piece when trying to find pieces for the assignment. Although I would love to explore it in a deeper level, I didn&#8217;t find it fit the assignment context. Nevertheless, I listened to it several times, and found that it&#8217;s filled with romantic composers influences.</p>



<p>Muse, and especially its main composer, Matt Bellamy, are a contemporary rock band that is self-admittedly influenced by classical music. One can find direct usage of music from previous eras such as Palestrina&#8217;s Sanctus and Benedictus rearrangement in the music Drones; Saint-Saëns&#8217;s Mon cœur s&#8217;ouvre à ta voix in I Belong to You; and Tchaikovsky&#8217;s &#8216;Piano Concerto No.1: Allegro Non Troppo E Molto Maestoso in Hoodoo. But there are far more examples of direct influence such as Bach&#8217;s toccatas in Plug In Baby, The Handler and In Your World;</p>



<p>Exogenesis: Symphony is divided into three movements entitled &#8220;Overture&#8221;, &#8220;Cross-Pollination&#8221; and &#8220;Redemption, and has a programmatic story of humanity coming to an end and everyone pinning their hopes on a group of astronauts who go out to explore space and spread humanity to another planet. Matt Bellamy, the composer, said that this composition was &#8220;influenced by Rachmaninov, Strauss, Chopin and Pink Floyd.&#8221;</p>



<p>Right from the beginning of the piece, I can find similarities with Wagner&#8217;s The Rhinegold prelude. The floating arpeggios building up on top of a drone bass, creating a long and slow build up and setting the mood, made it look like at least the composer used the same style as Wagner&#8217;s. This establishes the beginning of the programme of humanity coming to an end.</p>



<p>When Bellamy&#8217;s voice enters, it is with a long falsetto that is not common in rock music. The several repeated questions that the lyrics present, go very well with the repetition of the arpeggios.</p>



<p>The second movement starts with only a piano playing a chromatic introduction that resembles Chopin&#8217;s Etude n°10 opus 25. The next part resembles Liszt&#8217;s Transcendental Etude No.5, Feux Follets. But another quick change in mood brings an accompaniment that sounds again like Chopin, in this case, his Nocturne op.9 n°2 in E flat Major.</p>



<p>The beginning of the third movement has a straightforward feeling of Beethoven&#8217;s Piano Sonata No. 14, mostly because of its triplets arpeggios, but for me it brought to mind the melody of Liszt&#8217;s Liebestraum No. 3 in the insisting high note.</p>



<p>Overall, I really liked this song, although it&#8217;s not my favourite from Muse, I like how they were able to mix classical influences in a somehow Rock Opera while at the same time sounding like Muse.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Antonio Vivaldi, born in Venice in 1678, was a virtuoso violinist and composer, known for his innovative and descriptive music. His father, a part-time professional violinist and flamboyant hairdresser, taught him the violin and instilled in him a love for the instrument. Vivaldi&#8217;s flaming ginger locks earned him the nickname &#8220;Red Priest&#8221; when he entered the clergy, but his asthma made it difficult for him to recite Mass, leading him to abandon his religious duties and become a violin teacher.</p>



<p>It was in 1712 that he wrote Violin Concerto in A minor, Op. 3 No. 6, the sixth concerto in his 12 concerto collection &#8211; L&#8217;Estro Armonico. Overall it sounded too virtuosic for the solo violin, especially the first and third movements. </p>



<p>The three movements offer a delightful journey through contrasting tempos and moods. The first movement is vibrant and energetic, with intricate melodies that challenge the violinist&#8217;s technical skills. In contrast, the Largo movement introduces a serene and contemplative atmosphere, allowing for expressive phrasing and emotional depth. The final movement brings a lively and spirited conclusion, showcasing a rhythmic drive and dynamic contrasts.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Vivaldi&#8217;s career took a significant turn when he became the music director of a Venetian orphanage in 1716, where he was tasked with writing two concertos a month for the all-girls orchestra. In 1718, he took a second job as Chapel Master for the governor of Mantua, where he found inspiration in the beautiful North Italian countryside. This led to the creation of his most famous work, The Four Seasons, which he dedicated to the orphan girls back home.</p>



<p>The Four Seasons is not a single piece, but a set of four separate violin concertos, each with three movements, that are part of a larger collection of 12 violin concertos titled &#8220;The Contest between Harmony and Invention.&#8221; Each concerto is written for solo violin, accompanied by violins, viola, and basso continuo, and corresponds to a specific season: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.</p>



<p>Vivaldi&#8217;s Four Seasons is considered one of the earliest examples of program music, as it is accompanied by a series of sonnets that describe the scenes and emotions of each season. Vivaldi printed the text of the sonnets in the music and even inserted descriptive words next to particular notes, guiding performers on how to interpret the piece.</p>



<p>Throughout he creates diverse settings with his music, translating the vivid sights and sensations of each season into an amazing sonic narrative. Despite the short instrumentation, his composition creates powerful and diverse settings for listeners to discover. The first concerto, Spring, opens with an infectiously happy theme, followed by a chorus of singing birds, a gentle breeze, and a thunderstorm. The second concerto, Summer, begins with the oppressive heat of the sun, a singing turtle dove, a goldfinch, and a violent storm. The third concerto, Autumn, celebrates the bountiful harvest with a village dance, a drunken display of virtuosity, and a hunting scene. The final concerto, Winter, depicts the harsh cold, an icy wind, the chattering of teeth, and a cosy fire.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Around the 1730s, Vivaldi&#8217;s later years were lived with financial struggles and a waning interest in his musical endeavours, as the shifting musical landscape of the Enlightenment era posed challenges to his traditional Baroque style. The decline in demand for his operatic works and the ban on opera performances following the death of Emperor Charles VI contributed to Vivaldi&#8217;s financial hardships and dwindling popularity in Vienna. Despite his erstwhile celebrity and wealth, Vivaldi&#8217;s final years were marred by poverty, culminating in his passing in 1741.</p>



<p>Despite his celebrity and riches in his lifetime, he died in poverty, and his extraordinary music slowly disappeared. The rediscovery of his music began in Italy when Alberto Gentilly, a lecturer in musical history at the University of Turin, made an unexpected and important musical discovery in 1927. He was sent to value a collection of music that was for sale at the Collegio San Marco in the small town of San Martino Natale. Gentilly found 14 volumes of music by Vivaldi, which contained 140 instrumental works, 29 cantatas, 12 operas, and an oratorio. It was an amazing find, but there was more excitement to come. Gentilly realized that half of the collection was missing, and he had a brainwave that it might be part of a split inheritance. He tracked down the rest of the collection and persuaded the reluctant aristocratic owner to sell it. Vivaldi, who had been regarded by experts as a minor figure of the Baroque era, was about to become a major star.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tomás Luis de Victoria was born around 1548 in Avila, Spain, and passed away in 1611 in Madrid. He is considered one of the greatest composers of the 16th century, alongside Palestrina and Orlando di Lasso. His career spanned both Spain and Italy, and he was known for his almost exclusively sacred and polyphonic vocal music, set to Latin texts.</p>



<p>Victoria was sent by King Philip II of Spain in 1565 to prepare for holy orders at the German College in Rome. He may have studied with Palestrina around this time, and certainly, he was influenced by the Italian style. He held various positions, including chapelmaster and instructor of plainsong. In 1575, Victoria was appointed Maestro di Capella at S. Apollinare.</p>



<p>Notably, Victoria devoted himself entirely to composing sacred music, unlike many of his peers who also composed secular works. His works include 21 masses and 44 motets. He also wrote psalm settings, hymns, several Magnificats, four offices for the dead, and music for Holy Week services. His last work was the Requiem Officium Defunctorum (1605) in memory of the empress Maria.</p>



<p>Victoria’s music is known for its depth of purpose, which I found very present in O Magnum Mysterium. He fused the contrapuntal technique of Palestrina with an intense dramatic feeling that is uniquely personal and deeply Spanish.</p>



<p>As for comments by his contemporaries, specific records are scarce. However, his influence on later Spanish composers was incalculable. His pupils included Manuel de Falla, Isaac Albéniz, and Enrique Granados. His editions of early Spanish music laid the foundations of Spanish musicology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Humanism is a philosophical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings. Specifically, humanism affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives, rather than have meaning imposed externally by a higher power. Humanism focuses on human values, capacities, and worth. It places importance on human dignity and rationality.</p>



<p>Humanism originated during the Renaissance in 14th-century Italy as a cultural movement promoting classical learning and values.</p>



<p>Some key principles of humanism include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Emphasis on critical thinking and evidence over dogma</li>



<li>The belief that truth is discovered by human endeavour rather than revealed by a higher power</li>



<li>Commitment to the use of reason and science as ways of understanding the natural world and our place within it</li>
</ul>



<p>The humanist focus on human dignity, potential, and values translated into music that highlighted the skills and creativity of individual composers and performers. Complex polyphonic styles and instrumental music developed to showcase composer and performer virtuosity.</p>



<p>Humanist themes praised human emotions, experiences, intellect, and achievements became common musical subject matter. Vocal music with texts exploring love, loss, joy, carpe diem etc reflected humanist ideals.</p>



<p>Humanism&#8217;s emphasis on earthly life led to the growing popularity of secular music styles like madrigals and dance music. The use of vernacular languages instead of Latin also became more common, reflecting humanist values.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In my research on the history of dissonance, I discovered an insightful video by Alan Belkin that shed light on the evolution and usage of dissonance in music. Belkin makes a compelling point about the shift from vocal music to instrumental music and how this transition impacted the use of dissonance. Dissonance is more challenging to employ in vocal music, as singers must accurately hit the notes, especially when dealing with large intervals. In contrast, instruments can easily play virtually any interval.</p>



<p>Throughout music history, composers have used dissonance in various ways to achieve different effects. In the Baroque Era, composers like Bach utilised dissonance to build tension, which would then resolve to consonance. Bach employed suspension, creating dissonance that the ear accepts because it anticipates the resolution. This added drama and interest to the music.</p>



<p>During the Classical Era, composers like Mozart used dissonance sparingly to heighten emotion at strategic moments. Quick resolutions maintained overall harmonic stability. Mozart would occasionally insert dissonant notes into otherwise consonant themes, creating a playful dissonance.</p>



<p>In the Romantic Era, composers exploited dissonance more freely to convey intense emotions. Pieces often lingered in dissonance before resolving, using clashing intervals and chords to evoke strong feelings.</p>



<p>The 20th century saw composers like Arnold Schoenberg introduce the concept of the &#8220;emancipation of dissonance,&#8221; aiming to treat dissonant intervals and chords as equals with consonant ones. Additionally, microtonal music was created on top of dissonant sounds, generating micro-dissonances that could be subtle or very harsh.</p>



<p>In styles like jazz, dissonant seventh chords became fundamental building blocks of the harmonic language. For example, Gershwin&#8217;s harmonic language is infused with tangy flavors and impish energy through the use of juicy seventh chords.</p>



<p>Belkin argues that the true emancipation of dissonance lies not in using it constantly, but rather employing it strategically to create expressive effects. The perceived tension of dissonance depends on several factors, including the intervals between notes and the register (pitch) of the notes. The closer the notes are and the smaller the intervals between them, the more dissonance there is. However, there is a limit to how intense dissonance can become. A skilled composer will use dissonance purposefully to create expressive effects, rather than incorporating it merely for its own sake.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During the early Middle Ages (800-1450), the Catholic Church held significant power over many cultural aspects, including music. As the clergy and a select few were the only individuals capable of reading and writing, the Church was responsible for creating most music notation. These notations were meticulously crafted in highly decorative manuscripts known as illuminated manuscripts, which were carefully copied by scribes, often monks, onto parchment or vellum.</p>



<p>The process of handwriting and copying music was incredibly time-consuming and resource-intensive, with each manuscript requiring substantial effort to complete. This laborious process limited the number of copies of each piece of music, making the widespread distribution of music challenging. Additionally, the human factor introduced the possibility of errors, with each copy potentially containing inaccuracies rather than being a faithful reproduction of the original.</p>



<p>By the late 15th century, a new technique emerged for printing music, known as woodblock printing. In 1450, Johann Gutenberg&#8217;s invention of the printing press revolutionized the music world. With the advent of printing, the time and resources required to reproduce a sheet of music decreased significantly, leading to a rapid increase in the dissemination of musical scores across Europe. The fidelity of printing not only reduced the errors caused by human copying but also helped standardize musical notation.</p>



<p>One of the most significant impacts of the printing press was the reduction in the cost of reproducing music sheets. As scores became more accessible to musicians and the public, ideas and artistic movements spread more quickly, encouraging the development of new musical styles.</p>



<p>Although Gutenberg&#8217;s invention was a major breakthrough, other technological advancements also played a crucial role in disseminating music. Audio recording allowed for musical preservation and freed music from being locally confined. With recording technology, music performed in one part of the world could be experienced in another, providing a similar listening experience. Simultaneously, the widespread adoption of radio technology enabled music to be broadcast into homes, stimulating interest in various genres.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the internet has been a significant contributor to the widespread dissemination of music. In the present day, music is more accessible than ever, as digitized tracks can be instantly accessed globally, providing creators with platforms to share their work with a broad audience.</p>



<p>In conclusion, since Gutenberg&#8217;s invention, the dissemination of music has been closely tied to technological advancements. These developments have reduced the time and resources required to create and distribute music, making it more accessible to people around the world than ever before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Musical patronage has been a long-standing tradition in the world of arts, with its roots tracing back to ancient civilizations. It is a system where individuals or organizations provide financial support to musicians, enabling them to create and perform their work. This relationship between patrons and artists is complex and multifaceted, offering numerous advantages and some potential drawbacks.</p>



<p>One of the most apparent benefits of musical patronage is the financial support it provides to artists. Patrons offer direct financial backing, which allows musicians to focus on their creative work without the burden of financial worries. This financial stability can lead to a higher quality of work, as artists can devote their time and energy to honoring their craft rather than worrying about survival.</p>



<p>Musical patronage also extends its benefits to the wider community. Patrons who are familiar with the local music scene can support projects that benefit the community at large. This could involve funding music education programs, sponsoring community concerts, or supporting local music festivals. These initiatives not only enrich the cultural life of the community but also foster a sense of belonging and unity among its members.</p>



<p>Another significant advantage of musical patronage is its role in cultural preservation. Throughout history, patronage has been instrumental in preserving countless masterpieces and cultural heritage. Today, patrons continue this tradition by funding projects that preserve and promote historical and traditional music. This ensures that these musical traditions are not lost to time but are instead passed down to future generations.</p>



<p>However, musical patronage is not without its potential drawbacks. One of the main concerns is the dependency on patrons. Artists may become overly reliant on their patrons, which could compromise their artistic integrity. This could lead to a situation where artists are creating work to please their patrons rather than following their own creative vision. It is crucial that arts remain free from constraints other than those of the creators themselves.</p>



<p>Another potential issue is the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few patrons. This can perpetuate social hierarchies and favor artists with connections or privilege. It can also lead to a lack of meritocracy, where qualifications become secondary to loyalty. This could result in unqualified individuals occupying important positions in the music industry.</p>



<p>In my view, a healthy balance is the ideal solution. The market works well for popular styles of music, where artists can earn a living through sales and performances. However, I believe that there should always be some form of patronage to support music that may not be commercially viable but is culturally or artistically significant. For instance, state funding can support foundations dedicated to preserving national music heritage and education. Private and corporate patrons also play a crucial role in promoting new artists, especially those from lower-income backgrounds who may not have the connections or resources to showcase their work.</p>

<p>The shawm is an ancient double-reed wind instrument, introduced to Europe during the Crusades, that is considered a predecessor to the modern oboe. Its sound is produced by blowing through a reed, causing it to vibrate. Shawms were played by medieval and Renaissance musicians and used in dance and ceremonial music.</p>



<h2 id="the-viol" class="wp-block-heading">The Viol</h2>



<p>The viol is a bowed, string instrument that was popular during the 16th to 18th centuries. Its sound is produced by drawing a bow across its strings. It shares similarities in tuning and construction with the Renaissance lute. The viol is an ancestor of the modern violin family. It was played by chamber musicians and used in ensemble music.</p>



<h2 id="the-crumhorn" class="wp-block-heading">The Crumhorn</h2>



<p>The crumhorn is a Renaissance-era double reed woodwind that produces sound through a vibrating reed. Its cylindrical body curves upward at one end. The crumhorn is an early form of double reed instruments like the modern oboe or bassoon. It was played by court and street musicians during the Renaissance and used for dance music.</p>



<h2 id="the-sackbut" class="wp-block-heading">The Sackbut</h2>



<p>The sackbut is an early form of slide trombone, played from the Renaissance through the Baroque eras. Its telescopic slide mechanism alters tube length to change pitches. Sound emanates from buzzing lips against a cupped mouthpiece. The sackbut was played by Renaissance and Baroque instrumental ensembles and used in a variety of secular and sacred musical contexts.</p>



<h2 id="the-dulcian" class="wp-block-heading">The Dulcian</h2>



<p>The dulcian is a double reed ancestor of the bassoon that was popular 1550-1700. Like other double reeds, its sound comes from vibrating reeds. Dulcians were played by Renaissance and early Baroque instrumental consorts and used in chamber and orchestral settings.</p>



<h2 id="the-clavichord" class="wp-block-heading">The Clavichord</h2>



<p>The clavichord is a stringed keyboard instrument that produces sound by striking its brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents. It was mainly used in the Late Middle Ages through the Classical era. The clavichord is a forerunner of the piano and other keyboard instruments. It was played primarily by amateur musicians to accompany songs or for personal enjoyment.</p>



<h2 id="the-lute" class="wp-block-heading">The Lute</h2>



<p>The lute is a plucked string instrument and important precursor to the guitar. Its strings are plucked by the performer and its hollow body amplifies the sound. Lutes were extremely popular Renaissance instruments played by amateur and professional musicians. They were utilized in song accompaniment, chamber music, and solo performance.</p>

<p>I recently came across this piece on social media and quickly remembered of having heard it before in the TV show Mozart In The Jungle. However, I hadn&#8217;t given it much attention until now. I&#8217;ve just listened to the performance of the Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar conducted by Gustavo Dudamel.</p>



<p>This is the type of music I am naturaly drawn to. Great melodies combined with a dancing Latin rhythm is something that I find fits beautifully with an orchestral setting.</p>



<p>Here I found the instrumentation to be interesting, not only for the inclusion of non-traditional Western instruments like the Claves and the Guiro, but also the use of the violas as guitars with their strings being plucked.</p>



<p>The opening minutes of the piece have a medley-like quality, with various rhythms and tonal colors unfolding. From the smooth melodic start on the winds, passing to the strings and then a build-up of the piano before the full orchestra blows in a surge of powerful brass and percussion, instantly recognisable as a quintessential Latin sound.</p>



<p>This change in mood is perhaps what I liked more about this piece. The melodies are beautiful and soft, but when the rhythmic part enters in action, the whole piece gains an energy that is danceable and contagious.</p>



<p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this piece, and since I&#8217;m not yet familiar with the work of Arturo Márquez, I&#8217;m eager to explore more of his compositions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For this assignment, I listened to the recording of Prokofiev’s ‘Classical’ Symphony by the Frankfurt Radio Symphony conducted&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For this assignment, I listened to the recording of Prokofiev’s ‘Classical’ Symphony by the Frankfurt Radio Symphony conducted by Alondra de la Parra (2020) and the recording of Pulcinella (1920) by Stravinsky played by the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France conducted by Barbara Hannigan (2021).</p>



<p>From a historical perspective, the premiere of &#8220;Pulcinella&#8221; in 1920 and the &#8220;Classical Symphony&#8221; in 1918 allows one to situate both works squarely in the aftermath of World War I. This was a period of cultural change that moved against the Romantic era, marked by emotional expressivity and complex harmonic language. After the apocalyptic experience of World War I, people started to favour practicality and realism in art and philosophy, instead of abstract and metaphysical concepts (Taruskin, 2010). In music, as Burkholder et al. (2014:798) state, this led to a move away from intense emotions, irrationality, yearning, individualism, and nationalism, towards a return to the values of an earlier, seemingly more civilised era, such as the Classical style.</p>



<p>When addressing the apparent paradox of twentieth-century composers employing eighteenth-century Classical idioms, it is helpful to leverage the concept of &#8220;Neoclassicism.&#8221; This term, as Burkholder et al. (2014:798) explains, denotes a deliberate evocation of the principles and forms associated with the music of pre-Romantic music, including Baroque. Neoclassicism in music emphasised simplicity, polished textures, and refined melodies, emphasising instrumental over vocal, standardising orchestras and forms like sonata and rondo. Both Stravinsky and Prokofiev can be found within this neoclassical framework, yet they applied these influences in uniquely individual ways.</p>



<p>The exploration of Igor Stravinsky’s &#8220;Pulcinella&#8221; unveils an interesting journey through musical experimentation mixed with homage to the musical past. Composed between 1919 and 1920, and premiered as a ballet in May 1920, &#8220;Pulcinella&#8221; emerged during a period when Stravinsky began to divert from his earlier Russian nationalist style, characterised by works like &#8220;The Rite of Spring,&#8221; to what would later be labelled as his neoclassical phase. In &#8220;Pulcinella,&#8221; Stravinsky recasts the music attributed to 18th-century composer Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and his contemporaries with a contemporary touch, embodying the initial states of neoclassicism in the early 20th century (Leitão, n.d.).</p>



<p>Although it is considered a hallmark in Stravinsky’s production, as a turning point in the composer’s style, there is no consensus about whether &#8220;Pulcinella&#8221; truly fits the neoclassical label. Unlike typical neoclassical compositions, where the borrowed material is often reworked to fit a more modern style, Stravinsky keeps much of the original material in &#8220;Pulcinella&#8221; unchanged. For Cross (2003:110), his additions seem more like an elegant enhancement or gloss on the existing material instead of a complete re-composition.</p>



<p>I respectfully diverge from Cross’ perspective. While I acknowledge that Stravinsky reproduces certain movements largely in their original form (such as the Overture, Serenata and Gavotta), I argue that he engages in substantial recomposition in other sections (e.g. Allegro assai and Vivo). It is imperative to go into specific examples to illustrate this further.</p>



<p>Listening to the overture, it is clear that there’s a classical sound to it. The memorable theme being played immediately at the beginning is a Gallant trait and a repetition with a slight change, resembling, for example, Mozart’s Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, K. 525. This theme undergoes variations throughout the piece, showcasing the classical hallmark of Ritornello, a musical device extensively utilised during the Baroque and classical periods.</p>



<p>The Sinfonia&#8217;s melody-dominated homophony and the contrapuntal exchange between bassoon and oboe work reinforce the Baroque feel (bars 7-9).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="165" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.20.39-1024x165.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1910" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.20.39-1024x165.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.20.39-300x48.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.20.39-768x123.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.20.39-1536x247.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.20.39-2048x329.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.20.39-640x103.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.20.39-960x154.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.20.39.png 2452w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bars 6-9 of Overture: Allegro moderato </figcaption></figure>



<p>The classical feeling is further reinforced by the presence of traditional voice leading and the utilisation of perfect cadences. Ratner (1956) argues that in the Gallant style, full cadences are much more frequent and can be employed not only at the end but also within the composition. This is evident, for example, in the straightforward D major perfect cadence (bar 15).</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="674" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.23.33-1024x674.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1911" style="width:340px;height:auto" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.23.33-1024x674.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.23.33-300x198.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.23.33-768x506.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.23.33-640x421.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.23.33-960x632.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.23.33.png 1312w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bara 15-17 of Overture: Allegro moderato</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Despite these classical hallmarks, subtle hints of modernity begin to emerge, such as the strategic use of dynamics to create a dramatic interpretation.</p>



<p>Stravinsky employs a similar compositional approach in the Serenade movement, adhering substantially to the original classical style of the piece while subtly integrating select modernist elements. The melody retains the lyrical, cantabile quality and thin homophonic accompaniment texture characteristic of the original composition. However, Stravinsky introduces hints of 20th-century harmonic practices such as the dissonant harmonisation supporting the sustained vocal note (bar 17-18).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="847" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.26.08-1024x847.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1912" style="width:501px;height:auto" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.26.08-1024x847.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.26.08-300x248.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.26.08-768x635.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.26.08-1536x1271.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.26.08-640x530.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.26.08-960x794.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.26.08.png 1622w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bars 17-19 of Serenata: Larghetto: &#8220;Mentre l&#8217;erbetta&#8221;</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This manipulation of the traditional harmonic language can often be subtle, cushioned within the familiar cadences of the classical style, as we’ve seen before. Yet at times, it can be unsettling, particularly when he introduces dissonant vertical sonorities, resembling The Rite of Spring, that challenge the listener’s expectations steeped in the conventions of tonal music. A notable instance is the Allegro assai, where a dissonant C minor 6th is repeated 21 times at the beginning and 33 times at the end, each time at Fortississimo. This kind of dissonant intensity diverges from the norms of the 18th century, where dissonances were promptly resolved.</p>



<p>The choice of instrumentation in the Vivo movement, specifically the pairing of contrabass and trombone, allows for striking timbral effects and contrasts that are far from a classical choice of instrumentation.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the choice of only wind instruments in the Gavotte is a deviation from the traditional classical orchestration, further explored by Stravinsky with the melodic line frequently alternating between the oboe and flute, with the lower register instruments also periodically assuming the melody. This is a clear deviation from typical Baroque era roles of clear melody versus accompaniment.</p>



<p>Looking at the suite as a whole, Stravinsky&#8217;s innovations emerge gradually. At first, the work resembles a straightforward orchestration of an 18th-century piece. As it continues, hints of Stravinsky&#8217;s style periodically appear, becoming increasingly obvious. The transformation culminates in the jazzy ending that foreshadows the sound Copland would later develop.</p>



<p>This oscillation between conformity and defiance of classical norms encapsulates the dual nature of &#8220;Pulcinella&#8221; that could be seen explored by Prokofiev two years before.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Prokofiev tried a different approach for what would later be understood as his first (if not the first ever) Neoclassical work. In his Symphony No. 1 in D major, Op. 25, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Classical&#8221; Symphony, instead of reworking pre-existing material from the classical era, he created a composition with original material but “in the style of Haydn” &#8211; Prokofiev, as cited in Robinson (1987: 130).</p>



<p>In this symphony, which premiered in 1918, Prokofiev consciously adopted classical forms for each movement of the symphony, such as the sonata form for the first movement, a slow lyrical second movement, a gavotte replacing the conventional minuet and trio for the third, and a lively Sonata for the finale. In each of these movements, Prokofiev maintained the hallmark of Classical music: brief, restrained, symmetrical, transparent and scored for a small Haydnesque ensemble (Robinson, 1987:185). The light and elegant texture created by the modest orchestration of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings employs a classical ambient to the overall sound.</p>



<p>On top of the classical four-movement structure as we’ve seen before, harmonically, the use of D major in the first, third, and fourth movements, with the second set in the dominant key, A major, reflects the Classical practice of tonal organisation.</p>



<p>The melodies are brought forward and are discernible. The thematic and melodic elements are employed economically, reminiscent of classical composition, transitioning across instrumentation to create timbral contrast. One clear example can be found in the second theme of the first movement, presented in bars 19-20, and explored in the subsequent measures.</p>

<p>Within the third movement&#8217;s Gavotte, a brief interplay of counterpoint arises. The middle segment maintains a homophonic texture dominated by a distinct melody; however, with the entrance of a counter melody in the solo oboe (bar 21), a two-part counterpoint emerges, reflecting an influence of the Baroque era.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="763" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.38.11-1024x763.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1914" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.38.11-1024x763.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.38.11-300x223.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.38.11-768x572.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.38.11-1536x1144.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.38.11-2048x1526.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.38.11-640x477.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.38.11-960x715.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.38.11.png 2062w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bars 19-23 of Third Movement &#8211; Gavotte</figcaption></figure>



<p>In addition to form and melody, Prokofiev incorporates specific techniques linked to Haydn and Mozart. The sudden bursts in the opening bars of the first movement recall the famed Mannheim Rocket figures that Haydn adopted. The extra silent bar at the end of the exposition is a grand pause, another Mannheim trait meant to stress the sonata form&#8217;s architecture.</p>



<p>However, Prokofiev also differs from the Classical style. There are many unexpected key changes and distant modulations. For example, in the first movement he surprisingly, and almost provocatively, shifts from D major to C major.</p>



<p>Additionally, Prokofiev adds complex, syncopated rhythms beyond the Classical norm. Specifically in the development section in the first movement, the orchestra falls out of rhythmic alignment, introducing highly modern syncopations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.55.37-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1915" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.55.37-1024x531.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.55.37-300x156.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.55.37-768x398.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.55.37-1536x796.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.55.37-2048x1062.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.55.37-640x332.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.55.37-960x498.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-01-at-22.55.37.png 2434w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bars 131-135 of First Movement &#8211; Allegro</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, Prokofiev’s playful mixing of themes, witty contrasts and overall humour align more with the modernist inclination toward irony and satire than with the earnestness of the Classical symphonic tradition. His provocative modulations, such as initiating the recapitulation of the first movement in an unrelated C major, can be seen as a playful critique or jest at the conventions of classical music. This approach underscores his unique style, which often challenges and reinterprets traditional norms.</p>



<p>While both composers adopted a neoclassical approach in their respective pieces, it&#8217;s fascinating to listen to how each infused their compositions with distinct personal traits. Stravinsky, for instance, introduced his characteristic abrupt dynamics, unsettling repetitions and pushing the boundaries of instrumentation. On the other hand, Prokofiev employed his signature modulations and unexpected key changes. Here lies the beauty of neoclassicism. Its ability to evoke a sense of familiarity yet is full of novel elements waiting to be explored.</p>

<h2 id="reflective-account" class="wp-block-heading">Reflective Account</h2>



<p><br>Engaging with this unit on the classical era of music history helped me develop several new skills. Most notably, I gained a much deeper understanding of the musical concept of neoclassicism. While I was familiar with the term in the context of visual arts, studying its application to music in assignment 4 gave me new insight. Realizing how cyclical arts tend to be was also an interesting takeaway. Artists often look back in time for inspiration, not usually to the immediate past but rather to more distant eras. I see this happening currently as more musicians use musical ideas, samples, and lexicon from the 80s and 90s, similar to how composers in the 1920s neoclassical period were inspired by the 18th-century classical period.</p>



<p>This assignment also allowed me to solidify my personal preferences within the genre. The dramatic shifts, unsettling sounds, and instrumental experimentation present in Stravinsky&#8217;s work deeply resonate with me. What truly impresses me is his ability to infuse classical forms with his unique style, influencing music for years to come. Stravinsky&#8217;s work embodies the spirit of innovation within a traditional framework, making him a composer I&#8217;m particularly drawn to.</p>



<p>However, this journey wasn&#8217;t without its challenges. My enthusiasm for research sometimes overshadowed the pure act of listening. Getting bogged down in historical details and technical aspects occasionally prevented me from simply experiencing the music on an emotional level. Moving forward, I plan to strike a balance between intellectual exploration and pure listening pleasure.</p>



<p>The exercise I found most valuable in developing my skills was explaining the essence of Haydn’s Symphony No. 104 in simple, clear terms. Distilling complex musical ideas and history concisely takes practice and I believe this strengthened my ability. On the other hand, comparing period orchestras to modern ones was disappointing, as I did not perceive the contrast I expected in their sounds. Perhaps I would select a different piece to better highlight their differences.</p>



<p>Listening to lesser-known composers beyond the trio of Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn brought welcome new perspectives. I was particularly intrigued by Muzio Clementi and hope to explore more of his and other contemporaneous composers’ work in the future. If I were to undertake a similar exercise again, I would set aside more time to go more deeply into the biographical details and compositional outputs of more minor classical-period figures, especially women. Their contributions to the development of the era’s predominant musical style deserve more attention than I could give them here.</p>



<p>Overall, I found this an exciting first step in more fully studying Western classical music. The discoveries I made have motivated me to continue learning more about music history across different eras. Understanding context opens up a greater appreciation of the compositions themselves, so I am eager to keep developing a richer framework through which to enjoy the fruits of musical geniuses past and present.<br><br><em>Word Count: 480</em></p>

</h2>



<p>The Marriage of Figaro is a comic opera composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with an Italian libretto written by Lorenzo Da Ponte. It premiered in 1786 at the Burgtheater in Vienna. Based on the play La folle journée, ou le Mariage de Figaro by Pierre Beaumarchais, the opera tells the story of the clever servant Figaro, who is preparing to marry the vivacious Susanna. Their wedding day gets off to a rocky start, however, as their employer Count Almaviva tries to exercise his feudal right to bed the bride before the groom. The plot revolves around a single day filled with twists and turns, as various characters hatch plans to fool one another.</p>



<p>The opera is structured in four acts. Act I establishes the basic plot &#8211; Count Almaviva wants to seduce Figaro&#8217;s bride-to-be, Susanna and has abolished the medieval right of a lord to sleep with a servant girl on her wedding night to make his intentions seem more honourable. Figaro, the count&#8217;s servant, plots to outwit his master&#8217;s plans. In Act II, the Countess laments her husband&#8217;s infidelity while plotting with Susanna to publicly expose the Count&#8217;s plans to embarrass him. In Act III, complications arise with the adolescent page Cherubino, who has a crush on the Countess. There are disguises and much confusion before Susanna and the Countess expose the Count&#8217;s intentions. Finally, in Act IV all is resolved after much scheming, including multiple plans to dress up Cherubino as a girl. The Count begs for forgiveness, the Countess forgives him, and the opera ends with rejoicing over the two marriages – Figaro and Susanna, and the reunited Count and Countess Almaviva.</p>



<p>The Marriage of Figaro shows Mozart&#8217;s genius through brilliant ensemble writing and memorable melodies that capture the emotions of the drama. The overture introduces no less than 9 musical themes or theme fragments that set the mood for this opera. From the famed &#8220;Non più andrai&#8221; where Figaro teasingly says farewell to Cherubino&#8217;s carefree days, to the Countess&#8217;s hauntingly melancholy &#8220;Dove sono i bei momenti,&#8221; the opera overflows with musical riches. The finale of Act IV concludes the opera with one of Mozart&#8217;s most joyful and technically dazzling ensemble finales as all celebrate the happy outcome.</p>



<p>The Marriage of Figaro was an instant hit at its premiere and it has remained as one of the most popular operas for over 200 years. Its characters are recognizable archetypes depicting master-servant class tensions, marital infidelity and forgiveness, outwitting authority, and the confusion of young love. Musically and dramatically, the opera represents the height of the opera buffa (comic opera) genre with Mozart&#8217;s sublime music animating Da Ponte&#8217;s hilarious situations and characters. Performed frequently worldwide, The Marriage of Figaro continues to fascinate modern audiences.<br></p>

</h2>



<p>I just saw Mozart&#8217;s &#8220;The Marriage of Figaro&#8221; production by the RCM Opera Orchestra on YouTube. They delivered a delightful evening filled with humour, beautiful music, and impressive performances. While not a seasoned opera critic, I was captivated by the production, particularly the interplay between the skilled musicians and the engaging cast.</p>



<p>While largely traditional, the staging beautifully evoked the opulence of 18th-century Vienna. The classic sets and costumes felt timeless, allowing the focus to remain on the characters and their comedic antics. Sir Thomas Allen&#8217;s direction navigated the opera&#8217;s twists and turns, keeping the pace lively and the humour fresh.</p>



<p>The standout performances were truly captivating. Adam Maxey&#8217;s Figaro was a charming and endearing presence, his voice effortlessly conveying both wit and warmth. Julieth Lozano&#8217;s Susanna was a force of nature, her powerful and passionate vocals embodied the character&#8217;s intelligence and determination. The rest of the cast also impressed, with each singer delivering their roles with commitment and vocal skill.</p>



<p>However, the true highlight of the performance was the RCM Opera Orchestra. With the conductor Michael Rosewell, the musicians delivered a flawless performance. Their playing was tight, nuanced, and full of emotion, perfectly capturing the wide range of moods in Mozart&#8217;s score. From the brilliant Overture to the dramatic climaxes, the orchestra provided a solid foundation for the singers and truly elevated the overall experience.</p>



<p>While the individual performances were strong, the most memorable aspect of the production was the seamless collaboration between the orchestra and the cast. The final scene, where the music and characters come together in a joyful celebration of love and forgiveness, was truly magical.</p>



<p>While I might not be an expert, I felt that the RCM Opera Orchestra&#8217;s &#8220;The Marriage of Figaro&#8221; was thoroughly entertaining.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the early 18th century, music publishing centered around major cities like London, Amsterdam, and Paris. Publishers like John Walsh in London helped popularize Italian instrumental music and songs from London&#8217;s theater scene. Engraving allowed more music to be published and distributed across Europe. Meanwhile, the Ballard family held a monopoly on music printing in France, restricting publishing there.</p>



<p>Around 1750, Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf in Leipzig started experimenting with different printing methods to make sheet music more widely available. He used a combination of movable type, engraving, and manuscript copies . His editions were cheaper than engraved music, allowing him to distribute music more widely and create new markets. Breitkopf helped popularize the German sentimental song genre. Other German publishers like Hartknoch, Rellstab, and Schwickert adopted his techniques.</p>



<p>The onset of the 18th century witnessed a significant shift in music publishing, particularly with the commercial use of engraving. This method allowed for faster production and distribution of music, a stark contrast to the heavy movable type and manuscript copying that had been predominately used. Although manuscript copies and letterpress printing of music continued throughout the century, the development of engraving led to a more extensive and competitive music publication market.</p>



<p>London&#8217;s music publishing scene thrived around 1700, closely followed by Paris between 1740 and 1760, Vienna just before 1780, and Leipzig around 1800. Each city, in its prime, contributed to the cumulative growth of available published music, fostering a competitive environment that spurred public interest in music. This period intertwined with the rising of the middle class, whose demand for printed music became insatiable. Amateur music-making at home became a widespread phenomenon, breaking the monopoly of professional concerts and bringing music into the intimate circles of family and friends. This change democratized music, making it accessible to a wider audience beyond the aristocracy and religious institutions that had previously dominated musical patronage.</p>



<p>The engraving method, which began in London and Amsterdam, facilitated the international distribution of copies through Northern and Western Europe, propelling the music of Italian masters and others to unprecedented popularity. The success and efficiency of engraving caught on quickly, with publishers in major cities adopting the technique and contributing to its refinement. This led to an increased production of instrumental music and operatic scores, bringing a wider variety of music to the public.</p>



<p>In London, the music publishing industry saw significant growth under figures like John Walsh, who became the principal publisher of Handel’s music. Through such publishers, a more organized and expansive distribution system emerged, bringing music to more people than ever before. In parallel, similar developments occurred in Paris and Vienna, each adapting the engraving method to their unique cultural contexts and musical tastes, thus enriching the diversity of music available in the public domain.</p>



<p>The influence of music publishing in this era extended far beyond the mere accessibility of music. It catalyzed a shift in musical tastes, with public concerts becoming more popular and the amateur musician trend fostering a new consumer base for publishers. This period marked a crucial point in the history of music, where the production and consumption of music witnessed revolutionary changes, setting the stage for the dynamic developments in music publishing that would continue into the 19th century and beyond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As the lovely and gradual introduction in the first movement gets underway, the anticipation for a strong cadence builds and builds, but it doesn&#8217;t arrive. The music is constantly leaving you on a hook and, just when you think it can&#8217;t get any more energetic, the strings drop into tune and the winds have a moment of stillness. At last, the cadence arrives but the pace never lets up throughout the movement, toying with your expectations throughout. It&#8217;s a back-and-forth of suspense and surprise, the whole way up to a glorious conclusion that couldn&#8217;t leave you in any doubt of the music&#8217;s full force.</p>



<p>The second movement has the feel of classical formality, with a subject and then periods of rest. At first, the emotional restraint in this movement might make it less engaging, but the dramatic volume level gives the music layers of interest that will keep you listening.</p>



<p>Beethoven scores more points with dynamic change and strong contrast in the third movement. These are hallmarks of his style, and you can see why people, like me for example, just really enjoy listening to his music.</p>



<p>The symphony&#8217;s final movement starts dramatically and commands attention immediately. Throughout this movement, it feels like Beethoven is deliberately playing with the listener&#8217;s expectations again, creating moments where the orchestra resembles a choir and leading the listener to anticipate a conclusion, only to defy those expectations. The movement maintains a sense of suspense and anticipation, keeping the listener engaged until the very end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I listened to the first movement of Mozart&#8217;s Flute Concerto in G, following along with the score as best I could. I was able to follow the score fairly well during the opening orchestral sections and especially during the flute solo passages. However, there were times when the complex interplay between instruments made it tricky to follow every line simultaneously on the score. Still, I found that following the score enhanced my enjoyment of the music rather than detracting from it.</p>



<p>Seeing the notes on the page almost acted as a sort of spoiler, allowing me a sneak peek at whether the melody would go high or low next. Yet this glimpse into the music&#8217;s future only piqued my interest and engagement. I enjoyed anticipating how a phrase would develop or how the flute soloist would embellish the next repetition of the theme. It allowed me to listen more actively and attentively rather than just letting the music wash over me.</p>



<p>In studying the score, a few trademarks of the Mannheim School jumped out at me. First, the homophonic texture was apparent, with a clear melody in the flute over accompaniment harmony in the strings. Second, the harmonies tended to change slowly and smoothly during melodic passages. Finally, the virtuosic flute writing conformed to the Mannheim practice of featuring wind soloists. The flute gets several chances to shine both in lyrical passages and brisk, technical displays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When listening to period and modern ensemble recordings of the same classical works, there are some differences in instrumental tone quality, balance, and emotional impact. For example, I compared recordings of Beethoven&#8217;s 5th by the Orchestra of the 18th Century (period instruments) and the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra (modern instruments).</p>



<p>I must confess that I didn&#8217;t find a striking difference between both recordings. Maybe the contrast in earlier periods such as the Baroque might be more noticeable. In these recordings, the most striking contrast is in the tone of the winds and brass. On period instruments like natural horns, the sound is more raw, hollow, and buzzy compared to the refined, rounded tone of modern instruments. The period string section also tends to have a leaner, more transparent ensemble sound.</p>



<p>Emotionally, the period performances often feel lighter, fleeter, and less weighty. Dramatic moments have more nervous tension than rich, stormy anguish. Of course, much depends on the performers&#8217; interpretive choices; period recordings can still convey profound feelings. But the very sound of the instruments naturally lends itself to a different aesthetic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Classical era was dominated by three figures in Western music: Haydn (1732-1809), Mozart (1756-1791), and Beethoven (1770-1827). However, many lesser-known composers also made significant contributions that shaped the musical landscape leading to Romanticism. Composers like Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714-1788), Luigi Boccherini (1743-1805), Johann Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837), Muzio Clementi (1752-1832), Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714-1787), Antonín Rejcha (1770-1836), Johann Christian Bach (1735-1782), and Leopold Kozeluch (1747-1818) were influential in developing the gallant style and early classical forms of the symphony, sonata, string quartet and concerto.</p>



<p>Studying their works side-by-side with the great masters reveals similarities that suggest stylistic influences flow both ways. For instance, Mozart&#8217;s early symphonies bear resemblance to those of Johann Christian Bach, whom Mozart deeply admired. Clementi&#8217;s virtuosic piano works were likely a challenge for Beethoven to stretch his technical limits on the instrument. </p>



<p>Johann Christian Bach (1735–1782), the youngest son of J.S. Bach, was an important figure in London&#8217;s music scene and had a profound influence on the young Mozart when the latter visited London in the 1760s. </p>



<p>As the youngest son of the great J.S. Bach, I expected his music to be similar &#8211; intricate counterpoint, dense textures, almost mathematical complexity. But J.C. Bach&#8217;s style is completely different &#8211; light, tuneful, and crystal clear in its expression.</p>



<p>When I listen to J.C. Bach’s keyboard concertos and sonatas, I imagine aristocrats in powdered wigs and pastel suits, sipping tea and nodding along to the music. The melodic lines are so pleasant and catchy, with memorable themes that get lodged in my head. Underneath lies a simple accompaniment that allows the melody to shine.</p>



<p>Refined yet accessible, skillfully crafted but not flashy, his &#8220;Galant&#8221; style hints at the Classical period ahead under composers like Mozart and Haydn. No wonder the young Mozart was profoundly moved meeting J.C. Bach &#8211; the seeds of his melodic genius can be heard in the elder composer&#8217;s long, singing lines and transparent textures. J.C. Bach&#8217;s music floats by lightly, a pleasing precursor to high Classical elegance. (Sadie, 2006).</p>



<p>Among others we might consider is Muzio Clementi (1752–1832), a contemporary of the great masters who was both a noted composer and a famous pianist. Clementi and Mozart even faced off in a piano competition judged by Emperor Joseph II, which reportedly ended in a tie. This event, and Clementi&#8217;s virtuosic style, is thought to have influenced Mozart&#8217;s piano compositions to some extent (Georges De St.-Foix and Martens, 1923).</p>



<p>When I listen to the piano sonatas and other keyboard works of Muzio Clementi, I&#8217;m struck by their nimble, sparkling quality. The fast passages cascade up and down the keyboard with a lightness and clarity that sounds almost modern to my ears.  But there is also passion, especially in the Piano Duet in C Major, Op. 6 No. 1 or his Sonata Op. 26 No. 2 in F sharp minor. Here Clementi unleashes torrents of notes and sudden, dramatic contrasts that sound like Beethoven and it looks like it anticipated the Romantic period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This was the first Clementi work I listened to, and I found it to have great emotive depth. It featured intricate harmonies and masterful variation writing, offering a compelling listening experience. The slow movement is particularly poignant, with its evocative expression, providing a glimpse into Clementi&#8217;s musical prowess and his ability to convey powerful emotions.</p>



<p>One of the striking aspects of this piece is the technical usage of the pianoforte. The work progressively presents challenges for the performer, showcasing Clementi&#8217;s understanding of piano technique while exploring imaginative variations. This balance between technical demands and musical depth makes this work intriguing for listeners, allowing them to appreciate the potential of the keyboard.</p>



<p>The unexpected plot twists in the opening movement demonstrate the fusion of technical complexity with expressive musicality. The torrents of notes and sudden, dramatic contrasts make it an impressive movement both in technicality and musicality.</p>



<p>In the final movement, I notice a connection between Clementi&#8217;s writing and that of Beethoven, particularly in the strong dynamic contrasts. However, the rapid arpeggios that set the mood remind me more of a Romantic movement, suggesting that Clementi might have been an influential composer for future generations.</p>

<p>This was a truly enjoyable piece to listen to, similar to a vibrant chat between two close friends. It takes you on a journey through varying moods.</p>



<p>The piece begins with a lively movement, filled with cascading scales and playful tunes. It&#8217;s intriguing how it feels familiar yet different, not a composition from a known composer. The two piano parts intertwine beautifully, creating a delightful blend of friendly rivalry and harmony. The joy in their back-and-forth interactions is palpable, with one piano seemingly predicting the other&#8217;s phrases, building anticipation.</p>



<p>The second movement provides an expectable contrast. The melody becomes more introspective, featuring long, flowing lines that feel like a shared moment of reflection. The tenderness with which the two pianos merge into a single voice creates a sense of closeness and connection.</p>



<p>The final movement reintroduces the energy and excitement. The music surges forward with swift scales and virtuosic passages, a cascade of notes that carries the listener along. There&#8217;s a playful defiance in this movement, a celebration of the sheer joy of creating music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I&#8217;ve just heard Haydn&#8217;s Symphony No. 104 for the first time and I believe I can transmit my understanding of it to you in simple terms since I don&#8217;t think you need to know any musical terms to enjoy it.</p>



<p>The first thing to know is that since it&#8217;s a classical symphony, you might expect it to have 4 movements or parts. This is true of this symphony, called London. Although it has a name that sets it in a location, I think of this symphony as a ball, with several characters presented along the four parts.</p>



<p>First Movement (Adagio — Allegro)</p>



<p>The first part, or the &#8216;introduction,&#8217; greets you with a bold announcement, as if you&#8217;re entering the ball. There&#8217;s the announcement &#8220;The ball is starting!&#8221; Everyone seems shy at first, there&#8217;s not much action happening. The announcements keep coming and everyone walks in gracefully, but then the energy suddenly picks up and the dancers burst into movement. The strings act like a chatty, energetic and playful crowd, while the horns are like the grand host, full of bold and regal proclamations.</p>



<p>Second Movement (Andante)</p>



<p>The second part, often considered the &#8216;slow movement,&#8217; takes on a more reflective tone. Now, we stroll into a peaceful garden, a bit outside of the ball. This part feels like a leisurely walk, with a melody that seems to sing a heartfelt song, gracefully passed between the strings and winds. Sometimes we&#8217;re reminded that there&#8217;s a ball happening, but the characters here continue a chat filled with emotion, depth and sometimes melancholy.</p>



<p>Third Movement (Menuetto: Allegro — Trio)</p>



<p>The third movement is like the party games, more rhythmic. We&#8217;re back inside the ball for the real start of the party &#8211; everyone is dancing. It&#8217;s playful and lively but at one point, it dances into a lighter, more delicate section called the Trio &#8211; imagine taking a detour into a smaller group of dancers. It&#8217;s a musical break for refreshment and socializing before the climax of the dance.</p>



<p>Fourth Movement (Finale: Spiritoso)</p>



<p>Finally, the celebration reaches its peak with an energetic and spirited finale. This is the big finish, with all instruments joining a lively and joyful dance, celebrating the end of a wonderful day packed with adventures. Listen for the fast violin notes that seem to be extremely excited, while the rest of the orchestra adds depth and grandeur. It is a vibrant, joyful dance bringing satisfying closure to this sonic ball.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Studying Part Three was a real mix of feelings for me. </p>



<p>I love the Romantic era in music – it’s my favourite. Especially because I like seeing how history has shaped today&#8217;s music and this era was particularly impactful in today&#8217;s music. During the Romantic era, people started to see musicians as heroes which is reflected in today&#8217;s famous artists. Music and songs became a way for them to share deep feelings. I also enjoyed learning about how music started to reach more people, making it easier for regular folks to enjoy and play. It was a time for the democratisation of music. </p>



<p>The exploration of Romantic-era music ignited this fascination with the concept of musical evolution. How composers drew inspiration from their predecessors, adapted styles to suit their creative vision, and eventually paved the way for new musical forms was truly inspiring.</p>



<p>But, even though I liked studying this period in music, I also missed doing the compositional part of my course: writing and making music is what excites me. That hands-on part is something I look forward to and wish I had more of now.</p>



<p>Similar to my experience with the previous parts of my learning, I encountered challenges in managing my time effectively. However, the support and guidance from my tutor played a great role in keeping me motivated and determined to make progress, no matter how slow it may have seemed. I&#8217;ve come to realize that the journey of learning is not always about speed, but about the steady and dedicated progress one makes, regardless of the pace.</p>



<p>One part I feel good about is my assignment on how pianos changed in the Romantic era. I spent a lot of time researching and it paid off. I wrote a well-structured text that shows how the piano became key to all kinds of music.</p>



<p>Despite the challenges, I felt a sense of accomplishment as I progressed through Part Three. The time and effort invested were worth it, as I had gained a deeper understanding of the Nineteenth century&#8217;s music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lately, I’ve been interested in the piano as a player and listener. Therefore, I decided to research its development during the Romantic era. A new emphasis on powerful emotion, individualism and expressiveness in the arts characterised this period. As opposed to the reason and order valued during the Enlightenment, Romantic artists sought to explore the full range of human emotion and experience. Music was profoundly impacted by this philosophical shift, with composers experimenting with passionate, dramatic works to evoke strong sentiments from audiences. The piano emerged during this period as a revolutionary instrument that epitomised the Romantic spirit.</p>



<p>Gill Green&#8217;s &#8220;History of Piano Tuning&#8221; (2020) discusses the nineteenth-century upheaval and innovation in the piano industry, highlighting the rapid advancements during that time. The main innovation was the ability of this instrument to vary tone and volume based on touch, unlike the fixed volume of the harpsichord. Implementing metal and heavier wooden frames allowed for increased string tension and enhanced the piano&#8217;s capacity for thunderous fortissimo and delicate pianissimo voicings. The new double escapement action enabled rapid repeated notes through its responsive key return and hammer resetting mechanisms. Also, the expanded keyboard range of over seven octaves permitted a wider spectrum of tonal colour.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the new piano&#8217;s capabilities made the Romantic era paying audiences, especially the middle class, captivated by its ability to channel profound personal expression. This demand fuelled the prominence of new miniature genres and forms such as short piano compositions which perfectly showcased the piano&#8217;s expressive versatility.</p>



<p>Conversely, composers started exploiting the piano&#8217;s rich harmonies, creating melodies and dynamic gradations to conjure passion, conflict, intimacy and all shades of Romantic experience.</p>



<p>For example, Chopin&#8217;s nocturnes, such as his famous Nocturne Op. 9 No.2, spotlight the instrument&#8217;s singing lyricism and range of colouristic voicings to evoke moods from brooding melancholy to gentle bliss. Also, his études and preludes for solo piano, the Prelude Op. 28, no. 4 in E minor and no. 20 in C minor being two great examples for me, capturing shifting qualities of emotion through intense passages and lyrical melodies.  Chopin brought the bel canto to the piano, redefining its expressive capabilities and influencing generations of pianists and composers to come. </p>



<p>The piano&#8217;s expanding expressive powers also began to influence the sound and direction of Romantic orchestral music. No longer confined to a supporting continuo role, the piano emerged as a prominent solo voice within the rich orchestral texture, providing a contrasting intimate quality. Composers increasingly incorporated the piano as a soloist in concertos and symphonic works, juxtaposing its unique timbre and dynamic fluctuations against the grand orchestral forces.</p>



<p>For example, Brahms’ Second Piano Concerto integrates the solo piano part as an equal partner in dialogue with the orchestra, accompanying or contrasting with its passages. The most beautiful parts are when the piano adds a dimension of lyrical sensitivity and virtuosity to balance the orchestra&#8217;s imposing, expansive passages. Similarly, Tchaikovsky’s First Piano Concerto exploits the piano&#8217;s capacity for thunderous bravura and whisper-soft poeticism, especially in the third movement. It transitions from soft, to playful, to a raging force, enlivening the dramatic trajectory of the piece.</p>



<p>The piano&#8217;s small size and versatility had a significant impact backstage and may have contributed to the development of large-scale works such as ballet. According to Parakilas (1999), the rehearsal of operas, ballets, oratorios, orchestral works, and masses, was greatly influenced by the piano, as one instrument could stand in for an entire orchestra during rehearsals. This allowed singers, dancers, and solo performers to practice more affordably and efficiently.</p>



<p>The piano provided an ideal creative canvas for Romantic composers to explore new musical forms that departed from Classical norms. Short and personal forms emerged during the Romantic era as vehicles for piano solo composition such as rhapsody, nocturne, and song cycle. They all showcased the composer as well as the pianist’s virtuosity. Audiences were drawn to the drama and excitement of watching pianists conquer seemingly impossible passages and spark deep emotions through their playing. The spectacle of the virtuoso at the keyboard cultivated a “cult of genius” surrounding renowned pianist-composers. Their impassioned expressions of Romanticism struck a chord with middle-class audiences, who saw these artists as visionaries unveiling profound truths through music.</p>



<p>Liszt in particular cultivated an ultra-Romantic ideal of meritocracy, encapsulated in his quote “My talent ennobles me,” as noted by Greenberg (2013) in his analysis of Romantic era composers. Liszt became a hugely famous star, admired by audiences for his virtuosic piano skills. The poet Heinrich Heine coined the term &#8220;Lisztomania&#8221; to describe the frenzy surrounding Liszt&#8217;s celebrity and performances, which were known for dazzling technical displays. His prowess at the piano made him an iconic embodiment of the Romantic ethos of the artist-hero. His Piano Sonata in B Minor showcases how he could compose extremely technically demanding passages, pushing the boundaries of what was considered possible on the piano.</p>



<p>In addition to Liszt&#8217;s virtuosity, Clara Schumann, one of the female pianists to enjoy acclaim during this male-dominated era, set new standards for performance by playing recitals and concertos from memory, being a skilled improviser who brought creativity to her performances, and promoting contemporary composers like her husband Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms.</p>



<p>Character pieces for piano also flourished during the Romantic period. These brief works captured a single mood, place, person or situation through music. Titles like Chopin’s “Raindrop” Prelude, Mendelssohn’s “Song Without Words” and Schumann’s “Scenes from Childhood” gave clues to the miniatures’ poetic aims. This genre allowed experimentation with new harmonies, textures and forms within a condensed timeframe ranging from just one to ten minutes in length typically.</p>



<p>The condensed scope, alongside the small size of the piano and the development of publishing, made character pieces quite accessible to amateur pianists. These short piano works proliferated in musical salons and amateur recitals alongside the more ambitious sonatas and concertos aimed at virtuoso performers. Even complex programmatic cycles like Schumann’s Carnaval incorporated character pieces as movements. The character piece&#8217;s brevity and focus suited the more casual playing of non-professionals in home settings. With the rise of sheet music distribution, amateurs could readily acquire these bite-sized impressionistic works to perform for their own enjoyment or for small gatherings of friends and family.</p>



<p>This also led to the development of art songs, with composers sometimes organising songs with similar themes into collections called song cycles. Schubert notably created song cycles like “The Fair Maid of the Mill” and “Winter Journey,” based on the poems of German poet Muller, both evoking feelings of sadness.</p>



<p>As the piano became more accessible, art songs became a popular genre for home music-making, providing women in the 19th century a unique opportunity. This led to an increase in compositions by women composers, unprecedented in previous centuries, resulting in their rise to fame. Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, for example, composed about 500 musical pieces, including approximately 120 for piano and many art songs (Lieder), such as the elegant piece “Warum sind den die Rosen so blass.”</p>



<p>By cultivating these innovative genres for solo piano, Romantic composers ensured the instrument remained at the heart of mainstream middle-class musical culture. Whether expressed through compact character sketches or sprawling sonata structures, the piano gave Romantic composers their ideal canvas to paint bold new musical narratives filled with drama, poetry and intimacy previously unexplored in past eras. </p>



<p>The instrument shaped both listening habits and amateur music-making for generations to come. Its influence has been so profound that it is now the only instrument that features across all popular Western musical genres, including jazz, hip-hop, EDM, and rock.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As one of Chopin&#8217;s most famous piano works, I&#8217;ve heard this lovely Nocturne many times before but listened to it closely again recently. True to the nocturne style, it&#8217;s a short, simple piece with a straightforward structure centred on a lovely, almost naive melody that is instantly accessible and deeply romantic. The focus is absolutely on the long-lined vocal quality of the melody rather than complex harmonies, which remain mostly diatonic throughout. </p>



<p>While there&#8217;s not much harmonic tension, the interest comes from Chopin&#8217;s ornamentation that showcases the piano&#8217;s ability to quickly change notes, including trills, turns, and appoggiaturas. Despite its simplicity, or perhaps because of it, this nocturne is profoundly emotional to me. The famous melody is so classically romantic and intimate, that it&#8217;s no wonder it has moved listeners for almost 200 years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is probably my favourite Chopin piece and one of my all-time favourite piano works. The sheer amount of emotion Chopin packs into this short and simple prelude never ceases to amaze me. It feels heavy, deep, and lamenting &#8211; almost like a funeral march. The constant, heartbeat-like rhythm creates a dark and brooding atmosphere, especially when combined with the descending harmonic progression that forms the backdrop of the piece.</p>



<p>There is barely any melody to speak of, just a simple descending scale figure that is repeated and varied. Yet despite its simplicity, the melody is incredibly lyrical and sings with a beautiful, melancholic tone. In this relatively basic musical texture, Chopin captures something raw and overwhelmingly human.</p>



<p>The ending is my favourite part &#8211; the way Chopin delays the final cadence builds the tension to almost unbearable levels before resolving. That tragic, delayed resolution encapsulates the mournful and evocative nature of this stunning prelude.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When I listened to Yuja Wang&#8217;s performance of this concerto, I was drawn into a musical conversation. The piano starts quietly, making small talk with the orchestra. But soon it shows a bold personality, interrupting the orchestra strongly.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s something remarkably compelling when the piano interrupts the orchestra. It&#8217;s like the small piano is shouting against the group. These interruptions give the concerto a sense of struggle and triumph that adds to the piece&#8217;s drama.</p>



<p>Sometimes it sounds like the piano and orchestra are having a dynamic conversation, taking turns. Other times they angrily argue, competing for attention. This conversation keeps changing from calm to passionate. The piano brings thoughtful melody and skill, balancing the orchestra&#8217;s powerful sections.</p>



<p>In the second movement, the dramatic piano storms against the mellow orchestra. The orchestra sometimes responds mildly, creating a vivid contrast that heightens the overall excitement of the movement.</p>



<p>The gentle third movement has a flowing lyricism, with the cello spinning a beautiful song. This movement is rich and sumptuous. It&#8217;s a peaceful contrast from all the arguments before.</p>



<p>But it is the final movement that leaves an indelible mark. Here, the piano shifts from gracious to loud and forceful. The piano showcases its full range of expression. This movement captures the whole spirit of the concerto &#8211; starting peacefully and ending spectacularly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Listening to Schumann&#8217;s Carnaval, took me into a grand masquerade, where masked partygoers come together to celebrate the festivities of Carnival. Even Chopin appeared at this fictitious party. This piano suite, composed between 1834 and 1835, consists of 21 short movements, each representing a character or caricature from the carnival scene.</p>



<p>Schumann turned this piece into a storytelling breathing life into the characters. Pierrot, the sad clown, dances poignantly, while Harlequin, the mischievous trickster, bounds with infectious energy.</p>



<p>At times, the technical challenges posed by Carnaval seemed daunting, even overwhelming. Yet as I studied the piece more deeply, I developed a greater understanding of Schumann&#8217;s composition. Learning about his mental health struggles and how they may have shaped this music gave me new insight. I realized that the complex and shifting emotions woven throughout Carnaval serve to enhance its overall poignant effect. Every musical detail—each note, chord, melodic twist and turn—contributes to this emotional impact.</p>



<p>It is not the kind of work that I would love to listen to repeatedly. Still, I get the sense that it is a work that is important to establish the piano as an extremely expressive instrument and will continue to captivate listeners.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Wagner&#8217;s dramatic and emotionally charged music has long had a powerful influence not just on music lovers, but&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Wagner&#8217;s dramatic and emotionally charged music has long had a powerful influence not just on music lovers, but also on political movements seeking a sense of mythic destiny. This mystical attraction of music was and still is used by political propaganda and proved fatally potent when adopted by Hitler and the Nazis. But does Wagner&#8217;s music itself contain some intrinsic quality that made it the perfect vehicle for Nazism?</p>



<p>There is no doubt that Wagner had an anti-Semitic view of the world. In his notorious 1850 essay &#8220;On Judaism in Music,&#8221; Wagner expressed extremely offensive racist views towards Jewish people that were later exploited by the Nazis. He stereotyped Jews and said they could not truly make great art. Though a distortion, Hitler and other Nazis admired Wagner and saw him as an inspiration for their antisemitism.</p>



<p>I believe that there are aspects of Wagner&#8217;s works that undoubtedly appealed to the Nazi psyche. The huge mythical operas about heroes and gods match the Nazis&#8217; huge self-glorification. The medieval German settings and Norse mythology in works like The Ring suit the Nazi love of old Germanic purity.</p>



<p>The raw emotion in Wagner&#8217;s scores, for example, the extreme excitement when the music climaxes, is like the fevered Nazi rallies choreographed by Hitler and Goebbels. The gut power of songs like The Ride of the Valkyries taps into wild passions that override morality – just what the Nazis did so well.</p>



<p>Yet we must be aware of overstating this case. While Wagner&#8217;s operas worked well for the Nazis, the music itself isn&#8217;t Fascist. I couldn&#8217;t find information showing that there is anything intrinsically Fascist about the music itself. The emotional range of Wagner&#8217;s scores captures the full spectrum of human experience—from the uplifting to the disturbing. As with all art, his works are open to multiple interpretations.</p>



<p>I firmly believe that art and the artist should be separated and appreciated independently. Wagner&#8217;s music is no exception. We can still find value in his compositions while acknowledging the problematic aspects of the composer as an individual. We can reclaim his works for more positive purposes – his music leading us to contemplate humanity&#8217;s deeper bonds rather than divisions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A few days ago, I attended the Mozart Requiem concert performed by the Orquestra Filarmónica Portuguesa at the Aula Magna in Lisbon. The concert was conducted by the conductor Osvaldo Ferreira and featured a choir and four soloists: Marco Alves dos Santos, tenor, Carolina Figueiredo, mezzo-soprano, Raquel Alão, soprano and Miguel Maduro-Dias, bass.</p>



<p>The performance of Mozart&#8217;s Requiem by the Orquestra Filarmónica Portuguesa was a sublime and moving experience. The full orchestra, choir, and four solo vocalists brought Mozart&#8217;s immortal composition to life in a profound way.</p>



<p>The instruments used included the typical setup found in a classical orchestra &#8211; strings, woodwinds, brass and timpani. The strings provided the lush foundation, while the winds and brass added color and accent. The timpani gave dramatic punctuation while the four vocal soloists gave the Requiem an operatic quality during their featured parts.</p>



<p>While the Requiem is a familiar and often performed piece, hearing it live gave it an emotional immediacy and power beyond any recording. The soaring crescendos and hushed moments of silence resonated deeply. No media reproduction can truly capture the experience of hearing these sublime sounds &#8220;in the flesh.&#8221;</p>



<p>The program notes provided useful background and context about the piece and its history that enhanced my enjoyment and understanding. Learning about the mysterious circumstances of the Requiem&#8217;s composition and its intersection of the earthly and divine added deeper meaning.</p>



<p>Overall, this was a profoundly enjoyable and moving concert that will stay with me for a long time. I had never heard Mozart’s Requiem live before, and I was surprised by the difference it makes. I felt that the music had more life, more intensity, more depth. I could perceive the details, the nuances, the emotions of the musicians and the singers. I also felt more involved, more connected, more participant of the work. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I listened to Glenn Gould&#8217;s 1968 recording.</p>



<p>The most evident difference between Beethoven&#8217;s original and Liszt&#8217;s transcription is the instrumentation. Beethoven&#8217;s composition, created for a full orchestra, provides a vast palette of colours, timbres, and effects, allowing the music to be expressed with expansive variety.</p>



<p>In contrast, Liszt&#8217;s transcription scored solely for piano, introduces intrinsic physical constraints evident in the performance: The range and depth of sounds are not as broad as those produced by an orchestra; a piano&#8217;s sustained notes fall short when compared to those of wind or string instruments; and while dynamic contrasts can be substantial, they typically do not reach the extremes possible within an orchestra, even though the version I listened to did had significant dynamic variation.</p>



<p>However, there is a distinctive positive aspect to Liszt&#8217;s arrangement: intimacy. A single instrument, managed by one performer, transforms a grand, collective work into a more personal and individual experience. The piano takes the spotlight and, particularly during the Romantic era, places the pianist at the forefront. A single instrument offers performers greater liberty and room for expression; they can shape the tempo, articulation, and pedalling, ultimately making the performance a personal statement of the player&#8217;s own style.</p>



<p>I believe that Liszt’s piano version captures a lot of the spirit of the symphony, following the same structure and themes as Beethoven’s original. Liszt also tries to evoke the same feelings and moods, like tension, drama, contrast, and resolution. It’s not just a copy, but a new interpretation that honours Beethoven’s talent.</p>



<p>Regarding my preference, I found merit in listening to both versions, as they provide distinct interpretations of the same composition. However, if I had to pick one, I&#8217;d go with Beethoven’s original symphony. I feel it embodies the music&#8217;s essence more authentically and powerfully. I also appreciate Beethoven&#8217;s skill in balancing and contrasting various sections, themes, and instruments, as well as the way he develops and resolves musical ideas.</p>

<p>Listening to Albéniz&#8217;s &#8220;Suite Española No. 1&#8221;, I was immediately drawn to the piece &#8220;Asturias (Leyenda)&#8221; for its familiar Spanish elements. As a Portuguese listener, I found parallels to music from my own country.</p>



<p>The piano mimics a Spanish guitar, reflecting the central role of the guitar in Spanish musical culture. Repeated rhythmic strumming patterns capture the spirit of Spanish folk music traditions.</p>



<p>An insistent flamenco rhythm drives the piece forward, evoking the heel-taps of dancers. The struck chords suggest the clapping hands often accompanying flamenco.</p>



<p>The melody itself encapsulates Spanish folk idioms with its modal tonality and distinctive phrasing. This is the very essence of Iberian traditional music.</p>



<p>In naming the piece after the Asturias region, Albéniz implies a musical portrait, conjuring a sense of Spanish regional identity and local color. The title prepares the listener to be transported to the province through sound.</p>

<p>I happened to catch this concert and decided to listen since it featured a Portuguese artist playing the Portuguese guitar, something you don&#8217;t often see on international channels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t heard of Marta Pereira da Costa before, although I knew her name. She&#8217;s the world&#8217;s first and only professional female Portuguese guitar player in Fado music.</p>



<p>Right away the sound reminded me of Carlos Paredes, a legendary Portuguese guitarist, but with a fresher vibe, mainly from the percussion. Traditionally the Portuguese guitar is accompanied by two guitars, but here it&#8217;s one guitar plus percussion, bringing a modern twist which I enjoy.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m biased since I love the Portuguese guitar, but Marta&#8217;s playing conveys so much expression and goes beyond mellow tunes. Even faster, danceable songs have a singing, soaring quality from her guitar.</p>



<p>Another thing I enjoyed was how Marta lets the other instruments shine, especially in the last song. The interplay of bass and treble, each with its moment, creates a really beautiful, rich sound.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hector Berlioz&#8217;s Symphonie Fantastique, composed in 1830, perfectly reflects the obsessive mind of its composer, Berstein said in&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hector Berlioz&#8217;s Symphonie Fantastique, composed in 1830, perfectly reflects the obsessive mind of its composer, Berstein said in its Young People&#8217;s Concerts. But when I first listened to the symphony, I hadn&#8217;t watched Berstein&#8217;s video, so I expected something more contained and safe like other works from that period. But I soon realized why it&#8217;s called &#8220;Fantastique.&#8221; For me, the word &#8220;fantastique&#8221; evokes not grandness but a sense of surreal fantasy. In my interpretation, the symphony, rather than presenting a linear narrative, unfolds as flashes of disconnected dreams, each reflecting the protagonist&#8217;s shifting emotions and his fixation on an unattainable woman.</p>



<p>The first dream depicts meeting his beloved; the second involves a failed attempt to reach her at a ball; the third transports him to a tranquil rural setting, offering a brief respite from the turmoil; the fourth descends from a dream into a nightmarish execution; the final movement plunges him into a fantastical afterlife world. My feeling at the end is that maybe the woman of his dreams was only a woman in his dreams. </p>



<p>The reason I previously stated that I felt Fantastique was related to fantasy,  was due to the surreal and psychedelic nature of the music, which portrays the lovesick hallucinations and nightmares of the protagonist. Musically, Berlioz employed unexpected dynamic changes and unsettling orchestration, such as the use of real thunder in the storm scenes, taking a step further from Beethoven’s approach. He also innovatively used the main theme. This idée fixe is not merely a static melody; it undergoes a captivating transformation throughout the symphony, mirroring the protagonist’s evolving emotions and the unfolding narrative. As the symphony progresses, the idée fixe becomes increasingly distorted and anguished, reflecting the depths of the protagonist’s obsession and despair.</p>



<p>The first appearance of the idée fixe seems different from when a main theme is typically introduced, for example, in Beethoven&#8217;s Symphony No. 6. First, it doesn&#8217;t appear until around 5 minutes into the first movement, after an extended setup section &#8211; almost like an introduction leading us into the dream. When the idée fixe finally enters, it is in the form of a long, unaccompanied melody in the woodwinds, with bursts of energetic strings punctuating it. This unique presentation reminded me a bit of the surprising and unsettling rhythms in Stravinsky&#8217;s Rite of Spring. That unexpected rhythm must have been a shocking revelation for early 20th-century listeners.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="596" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-1024x596.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1823" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-1024x596.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-300x175.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-768x447.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-1536x893.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-2048x1191.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-640x372.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-960x558.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03.png 2816w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Although as I said before, the Idée fixe is transformed through the movements, its use in the fourth movement is extremely symbolic in its subtlety and, I must say, humour. This movement engages in the musical depiction of a march to execution. After the pastoral setting of the previous movement, the music abruptly shifts to the protagonist&#8217;s march to the scaffold, accompanied by a marching band. I was surprised because I expected a solemn setting, but instead it sounds almost celebratory, like a fanfare. The booming percussion and horns set a marching rhythm while the strangely cheerful melodies in the woodwinds and strings portray the crowd jeering the prisoner to his death. Just before the fatal blow, the idée fixe appears one last time on the clarinet, only to be suddenly, brutally cut off, symbolizing the severing of the head. The vivid musical imagery transported me right to the exact scene Berlioz intended to depict, which I found brilliant.</p>



<p>In the fourth movement, there are two main themes—a descending theme and a march theme—as well as a countermelody for the first theme. These all contribute to the overall feeling of the movement. The descending theme introduces a sense of despair, while the march theme brings the strangely cheerful contrast I mentioned earlier. One interesting thing is how the descending theme contrasts with the Idée Fixe melody—the Idée Fixe has a hopeful, ascending trajectory, whereas the descending theme embarks on a continuous, hopeless downward journey.</p>

<p>In the end, I must say that I adored this symphony. I feel that Berlioz brings a dramatic and theatrical sensibility to the symphonic writing, vividly portraying the emotional world of his desperate protagonist. So while fantastique may not be about grandness in the heroic sense, it represents a daring new musical language filled with psychedelic fantasy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Beethoven&#8217;s first piano sonata (No. 1 in F minor, Op 2) displays the hallmarks of the Classical style.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Beethoven&#8217;s first piano sonata (No. 1 in F minor, Op 2) displays the hallmarks of the Classical style. It contains a straightforward sonata form structure, opening with a lively first movement dotted with playful melodies. The middle movements provide contrast &#8211; a peaceful Adagio followed by a brisk dance-like section similar to a minuet. The finale introduces a vigorous theme. Throughout the piece, Beethoven focuses on balanced phrases and graceful melodies, supported by conventional harmony and rhythms &#8211; all trademarks of the Classical period.</p>



<p>In contrast, his final piano sonata (No. 32 in C minor, Op 111) exhibits innovations that push toward Romanticism. While still structured into movements, the form is more ecstatic, especially in the mystical opening movement. In this sonata, I hear many more chromatic harmonies and elastic rhythms and feel there&#8217;s an emotional range from brooding melancholy to joyful jubilation. The enriched harmonic palette and depth of expression represent the early Romantic style. </p>



<p>My research, in general, supports my feelings.</p>



<p>In the Opus 2 sonatas of his early period, Beethoven hews more closely to the balanced elegance of Mozart and Haydn. But flashes of his revolutionary voice emerge even then in the intense, turbulent passages. It contains a straightforward sonata form structure, opening with a lively first Molto Allegro movement characterized by accelerating small phrases leading to mini-climaxes, followed by pauses for theatrical effect. The middle Adagio movement offers the only overtly &#8216;pretty&#8217; music in the whole sonata &#8211; simple, serene melodies decorated with lavish ornamentation. The Allegretto finale features a slightly anxious minute tune pieced together from repeated fragments, counteracted by a smoother, more elegant major-mode Trio section.</p>



<p>The Op. 111 is regarded as one of Beethoven&#8217;s best piano compositions. It is a departure from previous sonatas, having only two movements, which led his publisher to question if it wasn&#8217;t a mistake. The sonata is described as powerful, passionate and inventive. For example, Beethoven transforms a simple and singable theme into five variations, ending in a serene and transcendent mood. Yet the animated fugue demonstrates Beethoven&#8217;s contrapuntal mastery cultivated in the Classical tradition. This piano sonata encapsulates Beethoven&#8217;s musical evolution from formal lucidity toward mystical, subjective soundscapes, prefiguring Romantic ideals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Antonio Vivaldi wrote three concertos for a small, high-pitched instrument called the &#8220;flautino&#8221;. The exact instrument Vivaldi intended is unknown, but scholars believe it was either the sopranino recorder or the flageolet. In the 18th century, the transverse flute replaced both the recorder and flageolet and a new edition of Vivaldi&#8217;s concerto was published for the piccolo, a member of the flute family. This is the version that is typically performed today and it was the one I listened to.</p>

<p>As soon as the orchestra begins the opening Allegro molto, the piccolo enters with a joyful, singing melody in the upper octave that immediately grabs my attention. The piccolo part requires technical agility as it features fast runs and trills, but the melodies flow so naturally that the difficulty is masked and it looks easy.</p>



<p>The calm and emotional middle Largo movement offers a lovely change from the faster outer movements. The piccolo carries a gorgeous, flowing melody above soft strings, reminiscent of a soulful operatic aria. It&#8217;s my favourite part—a moment where the piccolo&#8217;s expressiveness truly shines.</p>



<p>The concluding Allegro brings back the cheerful mood, with the piccolo presenting new melodic material over the orchestra&#8217;s constant, pulsing motion. The themes are fragmented with trills, creating a perpetually moving, spinning sensation. The cadenza features more rapid runs that showcase the soloist&#8217;s skill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Of course, I already knew the melody of the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, since it is one of the most used melodies in Christmas ads. But at this time I listened to it closely. In the beginning, I was immediately struck by the beauty of the music. The melody is light and airy and has a childish magical quality that transports you to another world. The use of the celesta gives the music a unique, ethereal and enchanting sound.</p>



<p>The presence of the bass clarinet is brief but it is truly remarkable. It brings a new tone and colour that adds depth to the beginning of the piece. The choice of the bass clarinet seems to bring a warm, mellow and rounded sound in contrast to the brighter, crystalline tones of the celesta. This elevates the overall feeling of the fantastical and mysterious setting.</p>



<p>Overall, it evokes a profound sense of innocent joy and wonder for me. The music exudes a youthful spirit of fantasy and imagination. It&#8217;s a timeless piece that brings out the inner child in me. Every listen renews feelings of wide-eyed enchantment and marvel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The bass clarinet is a woodwind instrument with a deep, rich tone, it provides a foundation for the woodwind section and entire ensemble. Though the bass clarinet has a relatively short history compared to other orchestral instruments, it has evolved into an expressive voice capable of solo works as well as supporting roles.</p>



<p>The earliest predecessor of the bass clarinet was the basset horn, developed in the 1770s. This instrument paved the way for lower-pitched clarinets. The first true bass clarinets emerged in the late 18th century. Heinrich Grenser is credited with creating one of the earliest examples in 1793. However, it was the pioneering instrument maker Adolphe Sax who developed the first fully satisfactory bass clarinet in 1838. Sax gave the instrument a wider bore and re-designed the key work to improve intonation across all registers. His innovations established the bass clarinet design that is still used today.</p>



<p>While the bass clarinet was slow to be accepted into orchestras at first, composers soon began to appreciate its unique timbre. Meyerbeer featured the instrument prominently in his 1836 opera Les Huguenots, one of the earliest uses of the bass clarinet in the orchestra. By the late 19th century, the bass clarinet had become a permanent member of the orchestra&#8217;s woodwind section. Its mellow, velvety tone contrasted with the more piercing oboe and soprano clarinet timbres.</p>



<p>In the orchestra, the bass clarinet typically provides harmonic support in the tenor and bass range. It handles the lower woodwind parts while the bassoon takes higher tenor lines. The bass clarinet has a remarkable three-octave range, overlapping the bassoon at the bottom end and the soprano clarinet at the top. This allows composers flexibility in orchestration. The instrument&#8217;s dark, brooding resonance lends itself well to dramatic effects.</p>



<p>Many composers took advantage of the bass clarinet&#8217;s solo potential as well. In Mahler&#8217;s Symphony No. 6, the bass clarinet introduces a moving theme in the first movement. Tchaikovsky exploits the instrument&#8217;s deep sound in The&nbsp;Nutcracker&#8217;s Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. Stravinsky showcases the agility of the bass clarinet at the beginning of The Rite Of Spring.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The history of the piccolo is closely tied to that of the flute. The first transverse flute was&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The history of the piccolo is closely tied to that of the flute. The first transverse flute was developed in the Middle Ages as an adaptation of the recorder. As military bands adopted the flute, a smaller version was created to make the flute parts more prominent. This petite flute was initially keyed like a recorder with six finger holes and was used to play melodies an octave above the flute.</p>



<p>In the early 18th century, the first piccolos appeared in orchestral scores, including works by Jean-Philippe Rameau. However, it was initially referred to by names like &#8220;flautino&#8221; or &#8220;petite flute&#8221; rather than piccolo. The instrument continued to develop alongside the flute, especially after Theobald Böehm invented the modern flute fingering system in 1832. Böehm&#8217;s revolutionary key mechanism was soon adapted for the piccolo as well.</p>



<p>One of the earliest major works to feature the piccolo was Handel&#8217;s opera Rinaldo in 1711. Composers began to utilize its unique shrill timbre to provide colour and brilliance. For example, Beethoven used the piccolo in his 6th Symphony to imitate the sound of whistling birds. Its high register allows it to be heard over the entire orchestra, making it an excellent accent instrument.</p>



<p>Today, the piccolo is a standard member of the orchestra and band. Its most common variant is pitched an octave above the concert flute, although piccolos pitched a major third above the flute are also used. Its highest notes can reach up to C7, above the treble clef staff.</p>



<p>The piccolo&#8217;s bright sound serves to bring out melodic lines and add sparkle to orchestral textures. As one of the highest instruments in the orchestra, the piccolo&#8217;s clear notes cut through dense arrangements. Composers often utilize the piccolo to introduce themes or complement the woodwinds. </p>



<p>While associated with the flute section, the piccolo player may switch between the regular flute and piccolo multiple times in a single piece. Due to its penetrating timbre, the piccolo is used with good judgment to avoid overpowering the ensemble. However, short piccolo solos and highlights prevent listener fatigue.</p>



<p>Piccolo parts require advanced techniques to handle the altissimo register and quick figurations composers write. Rapid passages showcase the piccolo&#8217;s agile nature. Trills, runs, and arpeggios demand precise finger dexterity. The small size necessitates strict embouchure control. Intonation can also prove tricky with so few open finger holes to adjust the pitch.</p>



<p>While the piccolo often plays an accompaniment role, there are also many famous solos and melodies written for it. For example, the piccolo solo in the first movement of Shostakovich&#8217;s 6th Symphony. The soloist plays with delicate restraint, creating a thoughtful and powerful moment. Other works that highlight the piccolo include Tchaikovsky&#8217;s The Nutcracker, which features the piccolo along with the flute flute engaging in a lively duet, in the Chinese Dance. and John Philip Sousa&#8217;s &#8220;The Stars and Stripes Forever,&#8221; which features a famous piccolo countermelody above the marching band.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>John Coltrane&#8217;s composition &#8220;Naima&#8221; is a lush, emotional ballad that showcases his virtuosic command of the tenor saxophone. The song is a tribute to Coltrane’s wife, Juanita Naima Grubbs, and is one beautiful ballads. The saxophone is the centerpiece of the song, accompained by the piano, the bass and the drums.</p>



<p>As soon as the saxophone enters, I am enveloped in the bittersweet melancholy of the piece. The tone is robust yet smooth, almost vocal-like in the way he caresses each note with vibratos and slight inflections that hint at a longing.</p>



<p>The flexibility and range of the saxophone allows Coltrane to truly sing through his instrument, conveying a depth of feeling that spans smooth joy to deep sorrow. I find his playing meditative and prayerful.</p>



<p>One of the things that makes Coltrane’s saxophone so expressive is his use of dynamics. He’s able to play softly and delicately one moment and then switch to a more forceful and aggressive style the next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last night I had the pleasure of attending a live performance of Mozart&#8217;s Requiem. When the conductor stepped up, he surprised us all by announcing they would open with Samuel Barber&#8217;s Adagio for Strings before moving into the Requiem. Though I knew the piece from movies and commercials, I had never truly listened closely before. I found it profoundly moving.</p>



<p>The opening immediately establishes a heavy, mournful mood brimming with emotional weight. It&#8217;s easy to understand why this piece is often played at funerals, including Einstein&#8217;s.</p>



<p>The main theme is deceptively simple &#8211; just three notes ascending. Yet the aching slowness, the dragging tempo, creates the sense of struggling to lift upwards only to fall back down. I loved how the stately, elongated melody passes from the violins to the violas and finally, the cellos, maintaining its emotional power throughout.</p>



<p>To me, it sounded extremely beautiful, but the melody alone doesn&#8217;t convey the full emotional impact. That comes from the harmony of the other strings, which inspire the melody with all its feelings. The rich harmonies and colours of the string orchestra add emotive depth. </p>



<p>This piece perfectly captures the universality of grief, transcending time and place. Though it was composed in 1936, it speaks profoundly to the shared human experience across cultures and generations. Little did Barber know what the world was about to witness and how this song would be embraced as an expression of mourning, remembrance, and hope.</p>



<p>In the end, it proved the perfect prelude to Mozart&#8217;s Requiem. Well-chosen, maestro.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This part of the course was challenging, but the end result made it all worth it. I never expected to spend so much time on it, especially since I have a full-time job and two young children. However, I can’t say that I regret the time spent because it was well worth it.</p>



<p>One of the most interesting aspects of this part was studying how composers in the 20th century started breaking the established conventions of tonality and harmony. It’s also interesting to see how this connects to major events like the World Wars.</p>



<p>Most of my time was spent diving deep into research for this assignment. I followed the advice of choosing a style that I was not familiar with, so I decided to focus on microtonal music. Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed learning about this style even though it challenged every notion and expectation that I had about its music.</p>



<p>For my research, I had one big question in mind for this assignment. How does microtonality improve the expressiveness of music? And the answer is clear: microtonality gives composers a wider range of pitches and harmonies to use. The effect is a more nuanced feel that’ll create diverse musical effects. It’s almost as if you gave a painter an even bigger palette of colours. Essentially, it allows music to have stronger emotions and meanings.</p>



<p>In my assignment, I think I was able to present my findings in an easy way to understand. However, I think there’s definitely still more to learn about this topic that wasn’t covered here. One thing is for sure, microtonalist composers liked to use this as a way to explore new ways of expression. And we can definitely see that in their work ranging from Carrillo to Collier.</p>



<p>For me, the biggest discovery was the connection between microtonality and the human voice. As Partch demonstrated in his opera King Oedipus, microtonality can capture the natural inflexions and variations of the voice that aren&#8217;t limited to 12 tones. This makes it a powerful tool for expressing human emotion and experience.</p>



<p>One question that still lingers in my mind is: is microtonal music a style or technique? On one hand, there are complete musical pieces composed entirely with microtonal intervals which suggests that microtonality is a distinctive style. Then, on the other hand, I learned that it can be used in any genre or style as an expressive tool. Maybe it’s both depending on how it’s applied and perceived.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I think this research was valuable because I was able to appreciate and understand microtonal music better. Plus, it inspired me to try composing my own music using microtonal intervals. Which should be easier with today&#8217;s technology.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Microtonal music doesn&#8217;t have a universally accepted definition. For example, The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Microtonal music doesn&#8217;t have a universally accepted definition. For example, The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians discusses microtones but not microtonal music (Ader, 2020). But it generally refers to using musical notes between the standard intervals.</p>



<p>The lack of consensus may be because microtonality has wide applications &#8211; from subtle timbre changes to entirely new sounds challenging traditional concepts of harmony and melody. But what is true about it is that microtonal music has the potential to broaden music&#8217;s expressive range. Dividing tones into fractions under a semitone allows composers to create new harmonies, melodies, and textures, evoking more emotions and ideas, and accurately simulating non-Western music.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that discussing microtonal music risks being too Western-centric. Equal temperament is the main tuning in Western popular music (Carlos, 1987). However, most world music, past and present, uses larger or smaller intervals than a semitone. Microtonality is integral to music cultures like Arab maqamat, African traditional, Indian classical shruti, Indonesian gamelan, Chinese, and more &#8211; each with unique tuning systems (Geer, 2014).</p>



<p>The microtonality found in many traditional musical traditions is often intuitive, based on the natural harmonics of instruments and the human voice. In contrast, the development of microtonality in Western music in the early twentieth century was more theoretical and experimental.</p>



<p>Ader defends that the fragmentation that occurred in the world of art during the early twentieth century was a major catalyst for the development of microtonality in music (2020). This was due to the breaking down of traditional forms in poetry and visual arts, which drove artists to explore the essence of their art forms, challenge conventions, and find new modes of expression. Poets began to focus on phonemes and sound, while visual artists dismantled traditional structures. This spirit of experimentation and focus on the most elemental components of an art form also inspired composers to explore microtonality.</p>



<p>Several composers explored microtonality, including Ivan Wyschnegradsky, Ferruccio Busoni, Charles Ives, and Ben Johnston. Alois Hába, Harry Partch, and Julián Carrillo represent slightly different perspectives and are worth discussing further.</p>



<p>Alois Hába (1893-1973), a Czech composer, teacher, and theorist, was a microtonal music pioneer. He grew up in Moravia, where he was influenced by local folk music and subsequently developed an interest in microtones (Forkert, 2020:79). Further encouraged by composers like Ferruccio Busoni and Hermann Scherchen, Hába created his own quarter-tone system, aiming to enhance tonality rather than replace it. As a teacher and theorist at the Prague Conservatoire, he educated many in microtonal composition and advocated for tonality preservation while using microtones. His compositions, including quartets, operas, and chamber music, blended tonal and microtonal elements in a distinct sound. His immense contribution to microtonal music influenced many composers, marking important milestones in 20th-century music.</p>



<p>Harry Partch (1901-1974) was an American just intonation pioneer. He was inspired by a German physicist’s book, leading him to create over 30 custom instruments for a 43-note octave scale, compared to the conventional 12-note. His pursuit led him to create over 30 custom musical instruments capable of producing a scale with an impressive 43 notes per octave, a significant departure from the conventional 12-note octave found on the piano. He invented his own notation system to represent the microtones in his music (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, no date). Partch’s motivation was to emulate the fluidity and expressive range of the human voice, which he believed was inadequately represented by traditional scales. Throughout his life, Partch remained dedicated to pushing the boundaries of music, challenging established norms, and exploring the untapped potential of sound. His enduring legacy is preserved at institutions like the Harry Partch Institute at the University of Washington, where musicians and enthusiasts continue to study, perform, and even recreate his innovative instruments.</p>



<p>The Mexican composer Julián Carrillo (1875-1965) claimed to have discovered microtones in 1895 by dividing violin strings into sixteenths. However, he did not compose microtonal music until 1922 when he became aware of the European microtone scene. Carrillo then developed an elaborate microtonal system called Sonido 13 that divided the octave into quarter tones and smaller intervals. He promoted Sonido 13 as a revolutionary break from the 12-tone octave that would destroy existing music, in contrast to European composers who saw microtones as an extension of tradition. Carrillo also theorized his system extensively in books and articles, conducting tuning experiments on harps and making conclusions about harmonics and acoustics. Though often aggressive in tone, Carrillo&#8217;s writings laid out a systematic microtonal theory unmatched by his European contemporaries. With Sonido 13, Carrillo sought to assert Mexico&#8217;s claim over microtones against European musical dominance.</p>



<p>The influence of pioneering composers in microtonality has resonated through the years. Contemporary composers, such as Horaţiu Rădulescu, Krzysztof Penderecki, and Ryo Noda, have contributed to notating microtonality into the contemporary musical canon.</p>



<p>Modern Western music has not forgotten microtonality, although it has long been used as an ornamental embellishment to add tension. The most familiar example is the bending of notes, where pitches often end up between the semitone intervals, creating microtones. A more recent example is Hans Zimmer&#8217;s use of microtonal string glissandos in the Joker&#8217;s theme for The Dark Knight soundtrack. The strings rise through several microtones between chromatic pitches, creating an extremely unsettling sound. A similar microtonal string effect occurs at the end of Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;How to Disappear Completely.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although temperament and expanded tunings were not historically adopted by pop and rock musicians, often avoiding them in favour of heavy pitch correction with auto-tune, there has been a recent surge in interest from modern artists. Dua Lipa, Sza, Jacob Collier, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, and They Might Be Giants have incorporated microtones into their music, pushing the boundaries of pop, rock, and electronica.</p>



<p>Technology has played a pivotal role in pushing microtonality into the forefront of music. Software like Ableton Live has made it easier to integrate microtonal tunings (Hart, 2016). This has led many microtonal EDM musicians to craft their own tunings, seeking new intervals and sonorities beyond conventional tuning systems.</p>



<p>Ultimately, microtonal music has the potential to enlarge the expressive potential of music by adding finer nuances and more complex language. By dividing the usual Western twelve-tone scale into smaller intervals it is possible to arrive at new harmonies and melodies unavailable within the common system. This creates more varied emotional expressions and new sound textures and colours. Comparable to how unquantized percussion revolutionised hip-hop in the 1990s, microtonality can contradict listeners&#8217; assumptions, creating tension and release different from what is possible within the established Western system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul></ul>



<p>I must admit, prior to this, I was unfamiliar with Partch so this is my initial experience listening to any of his compositions. Partch was indeed a uniquely creative artist, as he was known for not only inventing his own musical instruments but also scoring his compositions for a 43-tone scale unique to these instruments.</p>



<p>Despite being created over 70 years ago (1950), this piece remains surprisingly fresh and innovative. The composition is marked by its distinct sound, thanks to the use of Partch&#8217;s own instruments like the Bass Marimba and the Hypobass.</p>



<p>Although the microtonal melodies and harmonies of the piece often sounded to me as dissonant and jarring, it&#8217;s the unsettling sound contrasted with the comical visual of the instruments that makes it so unique. The sonata is a satirical work going into themes of madness, delusion, and paranoia.</p>



<p>This composition thoroughly blends humour and lightness with hints of darker territories. The lyrics of the piece might seem nonsensical on the surface, but they carry potential interpretations concerning the human condition.</p>



<p>Listening to &#8216;Sonata Dementia&#8217; is a challenging experience. The microtonality might initially seem daunting, but it may not be as intricate as expected. The initial dissonance from the 43-tone scale, which might seem hard to accept at first, gradually becomes more harmonic and natural as the pieces develop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently listened to some parts of King Oedipus, an opera composed by Harry Partch. I was drawn to listen to it because of the information about how Partch started to dive into microtonality, as it more closely resembles the natural human voice. This actually makes total sense for opera. People don&#8217;t speak in 12 semitones, but actually in hundreds of microtones and opera relies heavily on the expression of the voice. As I listened to King Oedipus, I noticed how the voices sounded more like speech than singing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partch&#8217;s music for King Oedipus is a unique blend of microtonality, percussion, and spoken word. The voices sound more natural, not sung, but spoken. The instruments follow the vocals and strangely don&#8217;t sound as strange as they do in other microtonal pieces by Partch. The microtonality allows the voices to more closely match natural speech patterns, rather than conforming to the 12 notes of standard Western music. I enjoyed listening to King Oedipus, even though I did not hear the whole opera. It was a refreshing and stimulating experience that opened my ears to new possibilities of musical expression.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Julian Carrillo&#8217;s Seis casi-sonatas en cuartos de tono para violoncello solo, performed by Gerardo Gimenez Cacho, offers a fascinating glimpse into the expressive potential of microtonal music. As someone accustomed to the familiar 12-tone equal temperament of Western classical music, I found these quarter-tone sonatas surprisingly easy to listen to and appreciate. The solo cello format helps make the microtones feel intimate rather than jarring.</p>



<p>With these sonatas, I could understand how dividing the octave into smaller intervals can open up new sonic palettes and colours. Microtonality provides the performer access to the &#8220;cracks between the keys&#8221; &#8211; those poignant notes that float between our conventional Western pitches. The cello seems to emote in ways that would be impossible with merely 12 notes.</p>



<p>I cannot imagine how difficult these pieces must be to perform well, given the challenge of precisely nailing pitches outside of the equal temperament celloists spend years mastering. The skill demonstrated in this recording is hugely impressive.</p>



<p>Occasionally the quarter tones sound somewhat unsettling, but more often I found they enhanced the cello&#8217;s innate expressiveness. For example, the aching melody in the third movement of Sonata No. 4 attains an extra sadness from its microtonal sounds. The result is something simultaneously familiar and novel.</p>



<p>The quarter tones may initially sound like &#8220;out of tune&#8221; notes, but one&#8217;s ear quickly adjusts, and their emotional resonance becomes apparent. Julian Carrillo has created a compelling showcase for the cello as an instrument of uncommon subtlety. Even for listeners new to microtonality, these Casi-sonatas offer an accessible and rewarding introduction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Listening to Jacob Collier&#8217;s &#8220;In The Bleak Midwinter&#8221; was an enlightening experience for me as I researched microtonality in modern music. As one of the most talented young musicians today, Collier&#8217;s ingenious use of microtones immediately drew me in. The track begins deceivingly simple but slowly builds in complexity. At one point, Collier modulates to what sounds like a G#. However, with microtonal inflexions, he has actually modulated to the key of G half-sharp major &#8211; something I did not detect on the first listen! The modulation is brilliantly executed, such that the music flows seamlessly.  I had to understand how he modulated and David Bruce helped me on that.</p>

<p>As I re-listened and focused on the microtonal shift, I better appreciated Collier&#8217;s technical mastery and innovative musicality. &#8220;In The Bleak Midwinter&#8221; proves he is not just one of the best musicians of our time, but one boldly expanding the boundaries of Western music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Radiohead is not a band that I particularly enjoy listening to, but I decided to listen to How to Disappear Completely to hear its use of microtonality. </p>



<p>The song starts off with a simple guitar and Thom Yorke&#8217;s falsetto vocals, nothing too unusual for a Radiohead track. The lyrics are vague and ambiguous, but they convey a sense of detachment and dissociation from reality. The song gradually builds up with layers of orchestral strings, guitar effects, and electronic sounds, creating a rich and complex sonic landscape. About two-thirds of the way through, the strings come in playing microtonal intervals that clash with the conventional instrumentation. These non-standard pitches on the strings create an unsettling, tense atmosphere contrasting with the dreamy opening section. The microtonal strings sound almost like they&#8217;re playing a separate song altogether, weaving an anxious counter-melody against the main chords. </p>



<p>This incoherent effect highlights Yorke&#8217;s lyrics about feeling disconnected from reality. While Radiohead isn&#8217;t my go-to band, I found &#8220;How to Disappear Completely&#8221; an interesting song with the use of microtonality to convey emotional dissociation in music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I enjoyed Ives&#8217; Three Quarter Tone Pieces for Two Pianos more than Hába&#8217;s quarter-tone sonata. The interplay between the two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart, creates an intriguing sense of conversation. One piano is tuned to standard western 12-tone equal temperament, while the other uses quarter tones. At first, they both sound out of tune, which has a quirky, childlike quality. But at moments they harmonize in an unconventional way that sounds oddly &#8220;in tune.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I kept listening, I began to familiarize myself with the microtonal language. The quarter tones initially sound discordantly unfamiliar, but gradually become interesting as my ears adapt. Although the microtonal effect hasn&#8217;t become conventionally pleasing to my ears accustomed to the 12-note scale, I can recognize the inventive nature and derive pleasure from the music on its own merits.</p>



<p>Overall, the quarter-tone pieces demonstrate that microtonality is an acquired taste that requires time to appreciate. The outcome is a captivating sound that I can find enjoyable, even though it hasn&#8217;t fully convinced me.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Strange is the first word that comes to my mind when listening to Hába&#8217;s Sonata for Quarter-Tone Piano,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Strange is the first word that comes to my mind when listening to Hába&#8217;s Sonata for Quarter-Tone Piano, Op. 62. After researching microtonality, I&#8217;ve come to enjoy the concept and composers&#8217; reasons for exploring it. But the truth is my ears are so accustomed to the 12-semitone scale that I initially find microtonal music weird. Recent examples in rock and jazz, like King Gizzard and Jacob Collier, are growing on me. Yet even in the slower, more lyrical second movement of Hába&#8217;s sonata, I struggle to fully appreciate the quarter tones. </p>



<p>Making an effort to keep an open mind, I can sense the pioneering spirit of discovery in Hába’s quarter-tone innovations. They impart an otherworldly, dreamlike quality as my ear gradually adjusts. But my long familiarity with 12-tone equal temperament means microtones continue to sound strange at first, even as I recognize their creative possibilities. However, after listening to it more carefully, I started to notice there&#8217;s some beauty and subtlety of the quarter tones. The sonata has a lot of variation and contrast that I can see me appreciating it the more I listen to it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While graphic scores may seem like an unfamiliar concept to many, they hold profound importance in the world of music composition. Rather than using traditional musical notation, graphic scores convey musical instructions through abstract symbols, shapes and colours &#8211; offering more openness to interpretation between composer and performer. </p>



<p>One of the earliest known uses of graphic notation can be seen in the 15th-century score &#8220;Belle, Bonne, Sage&#8221; by Baude Cordier. Crafted in the shape of a heart, it was a pioneering example of &#8220;eye music&#8221; &#8211; utilizing the visual design of the score as part of the composition. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-795x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1707" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-795x1024.png 795w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-233x300.png 233w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-768x990.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-300x387.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-640x825.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1.png 838w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></figure>



<p>Modern graphic notation truly emerged in the 20th century. Morton Feldman&#8217;s 1950 work &#8220;Projection 1&#8221; for solo cello featured scores that resembled abstract art or circuit diagrams more than standard sheet music. It showcased a trully visual innovation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="850" height="253" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1709" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2.png 850w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2-300x89.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2-768x229.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2-640x190.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></figure>



<p>What fascinates me most about graphic scores is their versatility. Some composers provide detailed guidelines to steer performers towards a specific vision, like George Crumb&#8217;s illuminating score for &#8220;Agnus Dei [SYMBOL]&#8221;, which is less abstract and relies on traditional notation symbols.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="639" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-1024x639.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1711" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-1024x639.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-300x187.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-768x479.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-1536x958.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-2048x1278.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-640x399.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-960x599.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4.png 2436w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>However, others opt to leave symbols purposefully vague, inviting creative dialogue between visual structure and a performer&#8217;s artistic sensibilities. Cornelius Cardew&#8217;s massive &#8220;Treatise&#8221; is a stunning example, offering no instructions on interpretation or instrumentation across its 193 pages.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="638" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1024x638.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1710" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1024x638.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-300x187.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-768x479.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1536x957.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-640x399.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-960x598.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>More than just an alternative form of notation, graphic scores blur the lines of distinction between visual art and music composition. The visual design becomes an integral part of conveying musical ideas, shedding light on how we perceive and synthesize different modes of art. Some graphic scores can even represent or visualize an existing piece of music, creating a physical manifestation for an otherwise abstract, intangible sound landscape, like for example the work of Nicholas Rougeux.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="966" height="1449" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1712" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited.png 966w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-200x300.png 200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-683x1024.png 683w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-768x1152.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-300x450.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-640x960.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-960x1440.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As a Led Zeppelin fan, I was eager to check out the band Greta Van Fleet after a friend&#8217;s recommendation. While I enjoyed several of their retro-rock tracks that pay homage to Zeppelin&#8217;s classic sound, the song &#8220;Light My Love&#8221; stood out as my favourite.</p>



<p>The piano melody at the start sets up an interesting intro, but after a few bars, the song explodes into a full-on rock explosion. The lead singer, Josh Kiszka, has a voice that sounds remarkably similar to the legendary Robert Plant &#8211; soaring and crystalline one moment, then shifting into joyful wails that drive the energy ever higher.</p>



<p>Though the chorus repeats in typical pop fashion, the anthemic sound of guitars and drums keeps it from being repetitive. Kiszka unleashes some spectacular high screams that electrify the lyrics. Overall, while Greta Van Fleet wears their influences proudly, &#8220;Light My Love&#8221; shows they can also craft an exhilarating retro-rock song that stands on its own. For a Led Zeppelin fan like me, it left me eager to hear more from this talented young band.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I really enjoy Steve Reich&#8217;s Clapping Music. It&#8217;s a creative and fascinating piece that uses only clapping to build intricate rhythms. There are no harmonies or melodies—just two performers clapping.</p>



<p>The background of this composition is also interesting. In 1972, Reich was inspired by a flamenco duo&#8217;s clapping patterns in Brussels and decided to apply his compositional technique called phasing to clapping. This resulted in a piece that became a major milestone in Reich&#8217;s career and helped reinforce Minimalism as a fresh perspective after the complexity of atonality.</p>



<p>The piece has clear instructions for the performers. The two performers begin clapping their assigned patterns in unison. One performer maintains their pattern unchanged, while the other performer gradually shifts their pattern ahead by one eighth-note at a time. This process of phase shifting creates a polyrhythmic texture as the parts drift apart. It&#8217;s hypnotic to hear the simple claps interweave. As the patterns phase apart, the texture grows denser and more energetic. When they realign, it&#8217;s satisfyingly resolved.</p>



<p>I admire how Reich does so much with something so basic. The phasing technique adds great depth to something so simple. The repeating patterns make me feel meditative and mindful. It&#8217;s always surprising to hear the different rhythms emerge. The subtle changes keep me engaged throughout the almost 5 minutes . This music shows Reich&#8217;s skill with rhythm and repetition: using just claps, he creates music that is complex and trance-like. Ultimately, I believe the piece serves as a creative study of musical texture and rhythm using only the fundamental human instrument: the clap.</p>



<p>One final small detail: At the end of a live performance, the audience uses the same instrument as the performers. I believe it&#8217;s the only piece of music where this happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Shostakovich faced inte­nse criticism and potential perse­cution from Soviet authorities for his controversial ope­ra, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. In response­ to Stalin&#8217;s anger at a performance of the opera, Shostakovich withdrew his Fourth Symphony. According to several publications, Shostakovich composed the Fifth Symphony in 1937 to rede­em himself and align with Soviet ide­als. This symphony served as an opportunity for him to showcase his talent while moving away from the avant-garde nature of his music that had previously been denounced.</p>



<p>The final movement&#8217;s different interpre­tations, influenced by the different interpretations of the tempo, have sparked extensive debates. Some conductors prefer to play it faster than others.</p>



<p>Listening to various recordings, a faster tempo such as the recording of Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic tends to convey a sense of forward momentum, a relentless push towards what could be perceived as a triumph. On the other hand, slower performances, like the one conducted by Yevgeny Mravinsky and performed by the Leningrad Philharmonic, allow for the finer details of the piece to sink in. They offer the listener more time to breathe in the music and as a result, the piece sounds more laboured, possibly invoking darker, ominous undertones.</p>



<p>When taking a closer listening, one can understand that, beyond tempo, phrasing and dynamics also shape interpretations about this final movement. I personally like it best when it&#8217;s played at a moderate speed. This lets the music move forward while giving space for the small details. It finds a good balance.</p>



<p>After my research and several listenings, I found that the faster tempo seems to dismiss the turmoil and complexities underpinning this symphony&#8217;s creation. A slower tempo, while adding additional detail and space for interpretation, can add an overemphasized drama.</p>



<p>Given the circumstances under which Shostakovich composed this symphony, it seems more correct to interpret the finale as not a full triumph nor complete despair, but rather an ambiguous commentary reflecting Shostakovich&#8217;s precarious position.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Benjamin Britten&#8217;s opera Peter Grimes premiered at Sadler&#8217;s Wells Theatre in London on June 7, 1945. Britten had begun sketching the work in 1941 while living in America with his partner Peter Pears during WWII. After reading George Crabbe&#8217;s poem &#8216;The Borough,&#8217; Britten felt a surge of inspiration to write an opera set in the Suffolk fishing village of his youth. Though he used Crabbe&#8217;s character Peter Grimes as his protagonist, Britten departed from the poem&#8217;s storyline to craft an original libretto with Montagu Slater. The libretto humanizes Grimes while retaining his inherent violence and ambiguity.</p>



<p>Peter Grimes follows the story of a fisherman named Peter Grimes who is accused of murdering his apprentice boys. The opera explores themes of mob mentality and persecution of outsiders. The use of tonality in &#8216;Peter Grimes&#8217; is characterized by tritone relationships. The opera&#8217;s dramatic movement is generated by tonal progressions between the keys of A and E flat, symbolizing the impossibility of coexistence for Grimes and the Borough. It is this eerie score depicting the inner turmoil of the protagonist Peter Grimes, that lends the emotional power to the opera.</p>



<p>Peter Grimes was hailed as a landmark in British opera when it premiered. The conductor was Reginald Goodall and Peter Pears performed the role of Grimes. It was the first of Britten&#8217;s operas to gain international acclaim and launched his career as one of the leading opera composers of the 20th century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sonatas and interludes for Prepared Piano &#8211; This piece has a strong focus on rhythm. The prepared piano, with objects placed on and between strings, creates an unconventional timbre. Yet within this unique soundworld, Cage constructs an organized and cohesive musical work. I heard some resemblance to Javanese Gamelan music and some parts reminded me of the Rite of Spring.</p>



<p>Imaginary Landscape No. 4 &#8211; Cage&#8217;s first piece of chance music. By tuning radios to different frequencies, chance collages of sounds, speech and music emerge. The juxtaposition of these fragments is unpredictable but often intriguing. It&#8217;s music created by randomness rather than conscious design. Though it abandons traditional musical elements, it has a sense of playfulness and spontaneity that I find amusing.</p>



<p>Roaratorio, an Irish circus on Finnegans Wake &#8211; I found it really hard to enjoy this long composition. Combines field recordings, spoken word, and segments of Irish traditional music into a sound collage. The complex overlays create textures and rhythms. </p>



<p>Regarding serial and chance music, both approaches challenge conventional tonality and require an open mind from the listener. Cage demonstrates that music can emerge from unconventional sound sources, chance procedures and found objects. He accomplished to expand the conceptions of music, art and listening.</p>



<p>The serialist pieces have a very ordered, logical structure that comes through clearly in the listening. The rigid rules of serialism &#8211; avoiding repetition, and ordered rotations through the 12 tones &#8211; result in cerebral, mathematical music.</p>



<p>In contrast, Cage&#8217;s chance music lacks that calculated complexity. The randomness and unpredictability create a more chaotic, spontaneous feel. While the serialist process is evident to the listener, Cage&#8217;s process is opaque. We cannot directly hear compositional systems, but I find this obscure and surprising thought interesting.</p>



<p>I  still believe that my definition of music is still valid in this discussion. While the composer organizes sounds and applies musical techniques, the real art happens in the listener&#8217;s mind. As Cage showed, music can emerge from non-traditional sounds when the listener lends them meaning. My definition recognizes how the listener&#8217;s role gives life and validity to music. Without the listener&#8217;s act of listening, there is no music.</p>



<p>Cage&#8217;s chance pieces may not convey traditional emotional arcs, but they can evoke moods like dissatisfaction, serendipity, and even humour. Serialist works induce intellectual stimulation more than direct emotion. But even in this case, a listener need not comprehend the serial process to be affected by the music&#8217;s dramatic quality.</p>



<p>So while the compositional approach shapes aesthetic effect, I believe music can deliver emotional impact being it systematically composed or leaving it to chance. The listener&#8217;s subjective experience remains central to lending music it meaning.</p>



<p>While the compositional approach undoubtedly shapes the aesthetic effect, I believe music retains the power to deliver emotional impact whether coming from a serialist complexity or Cage&#8217;s randomness. Ultimately, the listener&#8217;s subjective experience remains central to lending music its meaning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I decided to perform John Cage&#8217;s 4&#8217;33&#8221; alone in my living room. I set a timer to keep up track of the time. At first, there was complete silence as I sat motionless on a chair. After about a minute, I started to hear subtle sounds &#8211; the gentle creaking of the wooden floor, distant traffic noises outside, and the occasional sound of myself shifting in their chair. These ambient sounds almost took on a musical quality as I focused intently on listening.</p>



<p>The effect was surprisingly mesmerizing. In the absence of deliberate music, the mundane sounds, often unnoticed, took centre stage, and I immediately understood what Cage intended with this piece.</p>



<p>Around the two-minute mark, the silence was broken by my stomach rumbling loudly. I had to stifle a laugh at this unexpected bodily interjection. A few moments later, a siren wailed in the distance. The juxtaposition of these random noises with the intended silence of the piece was amusing to me.</p>



<p>When the 4 minutes and 33 seconds were up, I felt a sense of accomplishment. Although an audience may have enhanced the experience, performing 4&#8217;33&#8221; alone made me appreciate the musical potential of everyday sounds. I found beauty in the silence between the noises. This piece definitely expanded my perspective on what can be considered music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There were several composers I could choose from this period. Still, since I have an appreciation for merging styles of music, and I always liked Rhapsody in Blue, I decided to investigate George Gershwin&#8217;s work.</p>



<p>George Gershwin (1898 &#8211; 1937), a son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, became inspired to pursue music at a young age. He began writing songs while working for a music publisher in Manhattan’s Tin Pan Alley, which led to his first major hit, “Swanee” in 1916. Gershwin collaboratively wrote some of the most popular songs of the interwar period with his brother Ira, a number of which have remained standards in jazz music such as Summertime, I Got Rhythm and They Can’t Take That Away From Me. Gershwin also composed several renowned classical pieces such as Rhapsody in Blue, and An American in Paris, as well as the opera Porgy and Bess.</p>



<p>To understand the impact of Gershwin&#8217;s work, it&#8217;s helpful to analyse the context of the interwar national identity crisis. After WWI, countries looked to culture to define their identities. However, in the US, this was different. The country had many cultural traditions due to immigration and migration, leading to new musical styles. In 1893, Dvořák thought Black music should be the basis for an American classical style. By the 1920s, African-American genres like ragtime, blues, and jazz were popular nationwide. Gershwin used jazz in Rhapsody in Blue to create a unique American classical piece, that blended European and African American sounds, fulfilling Dvořák&#8217;s idea that Black music could define an American style.  Rhapsody in Blue was commissioned by Paul Whiteman with the intent of “classicizing” jazz to increase its respectability among white audiences. It debuted with Gershwin himself as the piano soloist, with a jazz band and a string section for accompaniment.</p>



<p>Listening to Rhapsody in Blue with this context in mind I can get even more out of the piece. I always loved how it mixed different styles, but now I can see how it blends together European and African-American music in a very special way. I think the piano part really stands out in this, changing from arpeggios and flourishes from Classic European music to more jazzy and bluesy ones.</p>



<p>Another Gershwin song I liked listening to was &#8220;I Got Rhythm&#8221;, which was written by the Gershwin brothers for the Broadway musical &#8220;Girl Crazy&#8221;. During this period, Broadway musicals were an important way to showcase music and were based on European operettas and comic operas. However, they were different as they included spoken dialogue, making them more accessible to everyone.</p>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t listened to it before, and the first time I listened to it, it sounded familiar, as if I had heard it before. After several listenings, I realised it was the syncopation and the call-response so usual in jazz that made it sound familiar. Actually, the chord progression from I Got Rhythm is known as the &#8220;rhythm changes&#8221;, and it&#8217;s the foundation for many other popular jazz tunes. </p>



<p>After realising the impact of this song, I decided to listen to his symphonic work Variations on &#8220;I Got Rhythm&#8221; for Piano and Orchestra. It caught me by surprise. It isn&#8217;t a piece of catchy pop music but it is inventive and, experimental but at the same time there&#8217;s always the jazzy feeling. I felt this could be the base of the development of Raphosy in Blues.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs4vYVdof8bc85dyGfx6svA"></a></p>



<p>Gershwin had a big influence on American music, even though his career was short. His works blended classical, jazz, and popular music, firmly establishing him as a leading figure in American modernism. His Broadway musicals, defied the notion that serious music had to remain distinct from popular culture, proving that meaningful music music could also entertain and be popular. While some classical critics initially questioned his approach, audiences and musicians loved it. His unique approach broke down music style barriers and brought an entire country together since he and others helped create a new American sound.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Maurice Ravel&#8217;s &#8220;Bolero&#8221; is a very well-known piece and is a masterful illustration of both orchestration and gradual development. Repeated continually, its single melody and rhythm manage to avoid monotony. Instead, Ravel uses a diversity of tonal colours, orchestral variation and incremental crescendo.</p>



<p>While not directly related to the music itself, I found Ravel&#8217;s background interesting context. His father was an accomplished inventor who created new machines and early cars. I believe that this exposure to machinery and technology as a child likely influenced Ravel&#8217;s fascination with mechanical sounds and rhythms, as evidenced in Bolero&#8217;s persistent snare drum beat.</p>



<p>Another intriguing aspect is Ravel&#8217;s use of the saxophone, uncommon in orchestral works of the era but prevalent in jazz. After listening, I researched possible jazz influences on Ravel. Indeed, he enjoyed jazz artists like Duke Ellington during a 1928 North American tour. He admired the percussive double bass and brassy glissandi. This openness seemingly inspired his experimentation in Bolero.</p>



<p>I&nbsp;deeply admire Ravel’s orchestration in &#8216;Bolero&#8217;.&nbsp;He fully exploits each instrument&#8217;s unique characteristics. His strategy of introducing the melody using different instruments in succession creates a unique texture and colour for each iteration of the theme. It’s not about a simple increase in the volume that results in the crescendo, but a careful layering of instruments that creates an intensifying texture within the piece.</p>



<p>The brief departure from the tonic key in the final segment of the piece, an unexpected occurrence in a piece that otherwise sticks rigidly to a single key, adds a mesmerising final twist. All the while, the steady percussion and pizzicato strings act as a grounding force, adding even more depth to the enthralling climax.</p>

<p>Varèse&#8217;s &#8220;Amériques&#8221; leaves me with mixed feelings. On one hand, I can appreciate its groundbreaking nature. Composed shortly after he moved to the U.S., you can sense this longing and curiosity, like he&#8217;s exploring new worlds. It&#8217;s wild and dissonant, with these intricate mixtures of percussion and wind instruments.</p>



<p>After hearing it, my definition of what music is hasn&#8217;t changed. I don&#8217;t want to come off as boastful, but I&#8217;m still convinced that music is a blend of sounds designed by a composer,  executed by a performer, which holds emotional significance for a human listener. This composition confirms my belief. Whether this is music or not really depends on the listener&#8217;s interpretation. In my view, it certainly is, although I didn&#8217;t fully appreciate it.</p>



<p>I actually want to appreciate &#8220;Amériques&#8221; for showcasing Varèse&#8217;s innovative spirit. But its interruptive, ever-changing nature also distances me from fully connecting with the music on an emotional level. While groundbreaking for its time, parts of its execution undermine my ability to fully experience what Varèse set out to convey about his new home and surroundings. Overall, I admire what he achieved, but also find myself holding it at arm&#8217;s length musically on repeated listens.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;A remarkable step forward on the way towards the ideal of symphonic unity (…) With his fifth symphony Sibelius raises the genre of the symphony to an entirely new cyclic level.&#8221;</p>
<cite><em>Veijo Murtomäki, musicologist, 1990</em></cite></blockquote>



<h4 id="sibelius-symphony-no-5-in-e-flat-major-op-82" class="wp-block-heading">Sibelius&#8217; Symphony No. 5 in E-flat Major, Op. 82</h4>



<p>If there were any doubts about Sibelius being a national treasure even in his lifetime, they were completely dispelled by his 5th Symphony. Commissioned by the Finnish government to celebrate Sibelius&#8217;s 50th birthday – a national holiday – the symphony was premiered on the 8th December 1915, with Sibelius conducting the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. While the premiere in 1915 garnered success, it didn&#8217;t meet Sibelius&#8217;s personal standards. The work was revised twice, in 1916 and 1919, until it got the version we can hear today.</p>



<p>The uniqueness of this symphony lies in its cyclic unity &#8211; perhaps inspired by the cyclic nature of Finnish Folk music &#8211; with motifs recurring and transforming throughout the entire work. Its melodies are influenced by the sparse folk tunes of remote northern regions. The primal cell, heard in the opening horn call, contains the genetic code for all the important themes that follow. Sibelius moulds these themes with tremendous skill, subtly transforming them in each movement yet always retaining their essence.</p>



<p>The emotional pinnacle of the symphony is reached in the finale. Inspired by the sight of sixteen swans in flight, the finale depicts their rustling wings with trembling strings beneath an expansive melody. A majestic &#8220;swan theme&#8221; is introduced by horns. As the work reaches its conclusion, this theme transforms into an exultant shout of triumph.</p>



<p>Today, Symphony No. 5 stands not just as a patriotic reminder of Finland&#8217;s nationalistic spirit, but also stands as one of his finest achievements, capturing both the raw beauty of the Finnish landscape and the meditative spirit it inspired in the composer through its now-legendary &#8220;Swan Hymn.&#8221; Its evocation of the majestic swans continues to move listeners decades after its composition.</p>



<p>Experience the unfolding narrative of this symphony as it tells a mosaic story of a composer, his homeland, and the uncontrollable forces of life itself. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Debussy – Jeux (1912) The ballet&#8217;s title tells the story of a boy and two girls searching for&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4 id="debussy-jeux-1912" class="wp-block-heading">Debussy – Jeux (1912)</h4>



<p>The ballet&#8217;s title tells the story of a boy and two girls searching for a tennis ball but ending up playing other games, some childlike and others romantic. It&#8217;s like a musical mystery, where things change and evolve. The main thing I get from this piece is its fleeting nature. Everything seems brief – short motifs, regular tempo changes, and a lack of stability. But somehow, it all feels connected. When listening, I felt that Debussy was trying to convey a sense of childishness – inconsequential, unfocused, and whimsical. But at the same time, it feels sweet, dreamy, and magical. Strangely for a Debussy piece, there&#8217;s not much dissonance.</p>



<h4 id="stravinsky-the-rite-of-spring-1913" class="wp-block-heading">Stravinsky – The Rite of Spring (1913)</h4>



<p>The Rite of Spring is one of my favourite music pieces. I love its intensity, rough rhythms, and surprises. It begins with a beautiful and iconic bassoon at a higher pitch, which clashes with expectations because one would anticipate an oboe or clarinet playing that folk melody. Throughout the piece, there are unexpected dynamics and rhythms, often relying on dissonance and interruptions. I believe Stravinsky intended to provoke and make the listener uncomfortable, evoking a sense of despair similar to a young girl being sacrificed by dancing herself to death. The use of percussion is crucial for the ballet&#8217;s dance aspect and to convey that feeling of unease.</p>



<p>Interestingly, whenever I hear this piece, it reminds me of metal music concerts, where chaos and loud noises reign. In both the Rite of Spring and metal concerts, the percussive element of the instruments is what moves and excites people. It&#8217;s remarkable how this aspect remains unchanged despite the 100-year difference.</p>



<h4 id="schoenberg-pierrot-lunaire-1913" class="wp-block-heading">Schoenberg – Pierrot Lunaire (1913)</h4>



<p>This was the hardest piece to listen to. The Sprechstimme technique goes against what I was expecting for the vocal melody. This creates a spooky and unsettling feeling that I reckon may go along with the story. The harmony in this music doesn&#8217;t follow the traditional rules and doesn&#8217;t have a clear melody or a familiar pattern. Overall, even though it might have been challenging for me to appreciate this unusual music, I believe it may reveal many interesting and thought-provoking structures that when explored more deeply may be surprisingly creative. At the same time, it&#8217;s really hard for me to understand what impact this piece had on the overall music.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Comparing the three, despite being written just one year apart, they are completely different styles. Looking at today&#8217;s music, I find it refreshing to see that there was a time when the best composers were exploring completely different styles. If I were to give these three pieces a personality, I would say that Debussy&#8217;s is more emotional and sensitive, while Stravinsky&#8217;s is more primal and brute. Schoenberg’s is somehow much less earthly, more imaginative, and surreal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently discovered Public Service Broadcasting when I heard their music performed by the 88-piece BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Jules Buckley. I liked it from the start and have been listening to it repeatedly.</p>



<p>I enjoyed how the music remains mostly the same but gradually adds different instruments and textures in a big build-up. </p>



<p>The most surprising aspect for me was the blend of drums and orchestra. I think exploring drums in an orchestral context adds a modern rhythmic element. I also liked the mix of pre-recorded sounds, electronic, and acoustic instruments. They fit together seamlessly, making it hard to distinguish between them.</p>



<p>Overall, it&#8217;s a perfect fusion of pop and classical music, with experimental elements that I appreciate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This course unit was quite challenging, especially since I decided to take on a full-time job alongside my studies. Balancing a full-time job, being a parent, and studying part-time has been quite demanding. As a result, my reflection centres around my perception that I wasn&#8217;t able to go as deeply into the subjects as I would have liked.</p>



<p>I found the first two projects to be incredibly valuable. They kickstarted my reflection on various aspects of music, such as its nature, what constitutes good music, and the differences between popular and classical music. This led me to question many of my preconceived notions.</p>



<p>One thing that pleasantly surprised me in this unit was the diverse range of music I was exposed to. From movie soundtracks to Indian music and contemporary styles I hadn&#8217;t encountered before, it expanded my musical horizons. Since my musical background was one of my main challenges, this exposure was truly beneficial. In hindsight, I think it would have been great to take this course as my first.</p>



<p>But, looking back, I wish I had spent more time on each subject. For example, I had a strong affinity for holy minimalist composers, and I would have loved to explore them further. On the other hand, microtonality and spectralism were not as enjoyable for me. I believe that with more time and study, I might have come to understand and appreciate what these composers are trying to convey.</p>



<p>The projects that focused on the Batman soundtrack and researching Magnus Lindberg were the ones I dedicated the most time to. Perhaps that&#8217;s why I found them particularly rewarding. Both projects allowed me to exercise a skill I had developed in the Stylistic Techniques course: writing about music. In both cases, I aimed to bring my own perspective to the table, going beyond regurgitating information readily available online. I hope I succeeded in conveying my own viewpoint while grounding it in factual information.</p>



<p>When I consider the overall content of the unit, I realize that some projects, such as those on orchestral instruments and music notation, had already been covered in other courses. If this had been my first course, those projects would have been perfect. However, since I had already delved into those topics before, I chose to skip them and dedicate more time to other projects.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I see progression in my studies, particularly in the broadening of my &#8220;musical baggage&#8221;. As for my writing skills, I have discovered that I find reflective texts much easier to write than &#8220;listening&#8221; ones. The most important lesson I have learned thus far is the need to improve my listening skills. I want to write about my experiences with music in a way that is clear, accurate, and captures everything that makes the music special to me.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Religious composers (holy minimalism) John Tavener &#8211; The LambI liked this song. I didn&#8217;t know John Tavener until&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 id="religious-composers-holy-minimalism" class="wp-block-heading">Religious composers (holy minimalism)</h3>



<p><strong>John Tavener &#8211; The Lamb<br></strong>I liked this song. I didn&#8217;t know John Tavener until today, and I was very impressed by this choral piece. It was peaceful, calm, and it seemed to be written to enjoy the echo of a church. This means that I didn&#8217;t feel sudden changes in the voices. Instead, they seemed to float on their own and slowly fade out.</p>



<p><strong>Arvo Pärt &#8211; Spiegel im Spiegel<br></strong>Another piece that I enjoyed, and I didn&#8217;t know the composer. The piano is very simple, but I think its purpose is to allow the violin to express long sustained notes. I can imagine this being played at a church, and the sound echoing through the walls. I have the desire to understand how deeply rooted this song is in Estonian traditional music.</p>



<p><strong>Henryk Górecki &#8211; Symphony No 3<br></strong>The music seems very peaceful but mournful at the same time, especially in the middle of the first movement when the soprano starts singing. I liked that the first half of the first movement seems like it is building up for a big explosion, but it never arrives. Overall, I think this symphony could be a soundtrack for a movie or documentary. I believe Zimmer thought so too.</p>



<h3 id="minimalism" class="wp-block-heading">Minimalism</h3>



<p><strong>Steve Reich &#8211; Music for 18 Musicians<br></strong>I find this type of music harder to enjoy. The simple sound and repetitive nature with subtle changes are not my preference. I understand the exploration of sounds, similar to Ravel&#8217;s Bolero, and can appreciate it to some extent. However, the length of the repetition is too much for me. Listening to it as a whole might induce a trance-like feeling and it made me wonder if this kind of music could also be used for religious purposes.</p>



<p><strong>Terry Riley &#8211; In C<br></strong>I tried to listen attentively to the entire piece, but once again, aside from the interesting exercise, I don&#8217;t find this art form truly enjoyable. What stood out to me was how the introduction of new sounds and instruments took the music on different paths. This was more noticeable when I skipped ahead a few minutes from time to time. I understand that the composer probably didn&#8217;t intend his music to be listened to this way, but for me, it provided a more interesting experience.</p>



<p><strong>Philip Glass &#8211; Glassworks<br></strong>I found this album much easier to appreciate than the previous two. Although there is still repetition, there is a sense of progression. It feels like the music is going somewhere. Some moments reminded me of Radiohead, which added another layer of interest. Another notable aspect of Glass&#8217;s music is the varied tempo compared to the previous pieces, creating interesting contrasts between songs.</p>



<h3 id="new-complexity" class="wp-block-heading">New complexity</h3>



<p><strong>Brian Ferneyhough &#8211; Exordium<br></strong>It&#8217;s difficult for me to write about this piece. I felt uncomfortable at times and wasn&#8217;t sure if I liked it or not. It seemed highly complex and lacked direction after my initial hearing. It felt more like an exploration of sounds rather than a cohesive composition. While I acknowledge that there is certainly thought behind this piece, I couldn&#8217;t fully grasp it.</p>



<h3 id="choral-music-tonality" class="wp-block-heading">Choral music/tonality</h3>



<p><strong>John Rutter &#8211; Requiem<br></strong>All of Rutter&#8217;s Requiem felt accessible to me. Even though I wasn&#8217;t familiar with the artist, there was a sense of déjà vu while listening to the pieces. It reminded me of Górecki, and I could imagine it as a movie soundtrack. The harmonies are simple, and the instrumentation is understated. However, this simplicity doesn&#8217;t diminish the emotional impact. For example, Agnus Dei felt mysterious and sombre to me.</p>



<p><strong>Eric Whitacre &#8211; Cloudburst<br></strong>The introduction was surprising and bewildering, with the gradual rise of all the sounds. I couldn&#8217;t determine if it was purely vocal or if other instruments were involved. I enjoyed how the voices floated at times, each having its own line, but I was even more captivated when they harmonized and created a powerful sonority.</p>



<h3 id="microtonality-and-spectralism" class="wp-block-heading">Microtonality and spectralism</h3>



<p><strong>Tristan Murail &#8211; Allegories<br></strong>I have limited knowledge of microtonality and spectralism, so this is a new experience for me. This particular piece left me uncertain about my feelings by the end. I attempted to identify recurring elements, but I struggled to do so. Instead, I found myself focusing on the electronic sounds and trying to differentiate them from the acoustic sounds. It was challenging for me to discern between the two. I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if this blurring of sounds was intentional on the part of the composer.</p>



<p><strong>Gérard Grisey – Les Espaces Acoustiques<br></strong>The overall pace of the music is slow, but it has a captivating effect. The first piece starts with a beautiful melody played by the viola which I really enjoyed. It had a certain pattern that kept coming back, and I couldn&#8217;t help but focus on it. As the piece progressed, more instruments joined in, which I found less interesting than the solo instrument.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 id="classical-music" class="wp-block-heading">Classical Music</h3>



<p>I haven&#8217;t been into classical music before. As a child, I didn&#8217;t have many chances to experience it, and as I got older, I leaned towards other genres. But since I started this course, my understanding and, consequently, my love for classical music have grown.</p>



<h3 id="contemporary-music" class="wp-block-heading">Contemporary Music</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m not very familiar with this genre, especially contemporary classical music. Nowadays, I don&#8217;t pay as much attention to it as I do to more traditional classical music.</p>



<h3 id="country-music" class="wp-block-heading">Country Music</h3>



<p>As someone who didn&#8217;t grow up in North America, country music did not made part of my listening environment as a child. I&#8217;ve come across some interesting songs, but I haven&#8217;t paid much attention to it. Lately, I&#8217;ve been enjoying the music of Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton.</p>



<h3 id="dance-music" class="wp-block-heading">Dance Music</h3>



<p>I was exposed to this genre a lot while growing up, whether through my brother or from going to nightclubs. However, it never really captured my interest. For me, the intensive repetition of music, with endless loops, bores me. Nevertheless, I do enjoy listening to Prodigy and Fatboy Slim.</p>



<h3 id="early-music" class="wp-block-heading">Early Music</h3>



<p>I have to admit, I didn&#8217;t listen to this genre very often. My main exposure to it was during my studies, when I explored it for academic reasons.</p>



<h3 id="folk-music" class="wp-block-heading">Folk Music</h3>



<p>I enjoy listening to Portuguese Folk Music, but besides my own country&#8217;s folk heritage, I don&#8217;t know much about folk music from around the world. The folk music I am familiar with is mainly from classical compositions that incorporated elements of folk music.</p>



<h3 id="jazz-music" class="wp-block-heading">Jazz Music</h3>



<p>Jazz took some time to grow on me. Initially, I didn&#8217;t have much of an affinity for it. However, as I delved deeper into learning about instruments and music theory, my appreciation for jazz started to blossom. Nowadays, it&#8217;s one of the genres I listen to the most. Stan Getz and Billie Holiday played a significant role in cultivating my love for jazz.</p>



<h3 id="musical-theatre-music" class="wp-block-heading">Musical Theatre Music</h3>



<p>As a child, I didn&#8217;t understand why characters in musical movies suddenly burst into song during conversations. This made me dislike the genre as a whole, including Disney movies. Over time, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate the music itself, but I still don&#8217;t enjoy the theatrical and cinematic elements that accompany it.</p>



<h3 id="opera-music" class="wp-block-heading">Opera Music</h3>



<p>Opera music, like musical theater, presents a similar challenge due to its complexity and occasional intricate ornamentation.</p>



<h3 id="pop-music" class="wp-block-heading">Pop Music</h3>



<p>What&#8217;s not to like in Pop Music? It&#8217;s catchy, easy to listen to, and often uplifting. I like pop music in general, especially when it offers something unique. Current pop artists I admire are Dua Lipa, Lizzo and Mark Ronson.</p>



<h3 id="rnb-music" class="wp-block-heading">R’n’B Music</h3>



<p>I was more exposed to R&#8217;n&#8217;B in the 2000&#8217;s when artists like Alicia Keys and Beyoncé exploded. However, my recent interest has shifted towards 70s music, which features incredible R&#8217;n&#8217;B artists like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder.</p>



<h3 id="rap-music" class="wp-block-heading">Rap Music</h3>



<p>Rap music is a genre that I either really love or strongly dislike. I&#8217;ve listened to a lot of rap music, particularly in the 2000s, which helped me develop an appreciation for artists like Eminem and Outkast. Recently, I&#8217;ve been enjoying De La Soul and The Roots after discovering J Dilla&#8217;s songs.</p>



<h3 id="reggae-music" class="wp-block-heading">Reggae Music</h3>



<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t know much about Reggae beyond Bob Marley. It&#8217;s mostly unfamiliar territory to me.</p>



<h3 id="rock-music" class="wp-block-heading">Rock Music</h3>



<p>In general, my listening attention is divided between Rock and Funk, so it&#8217;s a genre I appreciate a lot. I love the combination of bass, guitar, and drums. It&#8217;s amazing how these instruments can create such great music. I also find it fascinating how Rock has evolved over the years.</p>



<h3 id="soul-music" class="wp-block-heading">Soul Music</h3>



<p>As I&#8217;m getting older, I&#8217;ve been enjoying Soul music more and more. I&#8217;m particularly drawn to Soul songs that feature a strong bass line and keyboard melodies. They grab my attention right away.</p>



<p></p>



<h1 id="exploring-new-music" class="wp-block-heading">Exploring new music</h1>



<h3 id="reggae" class="wp-block-heading">Reggae</h3>



<p><strong>Ini Kamoze &#8211; World A Music</strong></p>



<p>I like how the beats syncopate on the 2nd and 4th. The sound that catches my attention the most is the reverb—it&#8217;s a bit excessive, but it adds that characteristic Reggae touch. The bassline is wonderfully uncomplicated, yet it perfectly complements the overall mood of the song. The vocals have such a relaxed vibe, which again aligns beautifully with the song and the genre. Overall, I really enjoyed it, although I must admit that the repetitive nature can get a bit monotonous after a while.</p>



<p><strong>Freak Out &#8211; Jackie Mittoo</strong></p>



<p>I enjoyed listening to this song. Even though it maintains the characteristic repetitiveness of Reggae, I find that being an instrumental piece adds a refreshing touch. What&#8217;s more, it strikes a perfect balance with the reverb—it&#8217;s not overpowering, and I genuinely appreciate that.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 id="opera" class="wp-block-heading">Opera</h3>



<p><strong>Mark-Anthony Turnage – Lament for a Hanging Man</strong></p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t the kind of opera I was expecting to listen to. Most of the operas I&#8217;ve listened to were composed before the 19th century. But this one, released in 1995, has a more modern vibe. The instruments used in the orchestra are diverse, including saxophones, bass clarinets, and percussion. This creates different sounds and rhythms that sometimes feel energetic and unpredictable, while other times they are more controlled and melodic. Overall, I liked it more than I was expecting. Especially the jazzy parts.</p>



<h3 id="indian" class="wp-block-heading">Indian</h3>



<p><strong>Ravi Shankar – Song From The Hills</strong></p>



<p>Besides the main differences of not having a common Western harmonic development, the difference I found insteresting in this music is the instrumentation. For example, in this piece, they use instruments like the tabla, which is a type of drum that creates rhythmic beats. It adds a lively and energetic feel to the music. There is also a shaking instrument that produces a shaking sound that adds some texture to the overall sound. Personally, I enjoyed listening to this piece and its unique style. However, since it doesn&#8217;t relate directly to my own culture, I couldn&#8217;t connect with it on a deep level. Even though this style of music may not be familiar to us, it can still be enjoyable to listen to and appreciate.</p>

<p>Before we dive into the topic, I want to share a quick observation. When I first encountered the term &#8220;contemporary music,&#8221; my immediate thought was about classical contemporary music. However, I questioned myself and wondered why that was the case. What exactly is contemporary music? So, I researched, and the most satisfactory answer for me came from the Berkeley website, which defines contemporary music as an approach rather than a specific genre. It involves creating and performing rhythmically, harmonically, and texturally current music while incorporating diverse influences and cross-pollination of genres (Mirisola, 2019). </p>



<p>Living in Lisbon, a big city, offers many opportunities to enjoy live music by composers who are currently active. The Portuguese music scene is lively right now, with new composers emerging regularly, while still honoring established ones. What&#8217;s interesting is that Portugal, especially Lisbon, is a melting pot of cultures, and this diversity is reflected in the contemporary music scene. It&#8217;s amazing to witness the fusion of hip-hop and classical music, Cape Verdean melodies blending with fado, and even the recent combination of Flamenco and pop music. The physical spaces complement this musical movement, showing the interconnectedness of it all. There are more dedicated venues for contemporary music, both large ones like Centro Cultural de Belém and Gulbenkian, and smaller spaces throughout the city, even the streets themselves become stages for different composers.</p>



<p>Contemporary music analysis can be quite a challenge. We&#8217;ve seen throughout history that time plays a crucial role in determining its true worth. It needs the space to grow and evolve before we can make a fair judgment. That&#8217;s when we can truly grasp what will stand the test of time and hold cultural significance in the future. I understand that contemporary music serves as a mirror of our times, capturing the spirit and emotions of the present era. It thrives on pushing boundaries and challenging conventional norms, constantly evolving to reflect the changing world around us. But at times it may be challenging to fully grasp the intricacies of contemporary music. Whenever I come across contemporary music that doesn&#8217;t conform to the usual standards, my initial reaction tends to be one of hesitation. I find myself wondering if it&#8217;s using certain sounds and techniques just for the sake of it, without a clear purpose. But I make an effort to listen and try to understand its value. Let me share an example: when I first listened to Magnus Lindberg&#8217;s Kraft, I wasn&#8217;t immediately drawn in. It sounded like random noise, I have to admit. However, as I delved deeper into researching the composer, I realized the importance of considering it within the broader musical landscape. But that&#8217;s the analytical side of appreciating music. On an emotional level, I often find that the more unconventional the music, the less it captures my interest.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Magnus Lindberg, born in 1958 in Helsinki, burst onto the global contemporary music scene in the early 80s,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Magnus Lindberg, born in 1958 in Helsinki, burst onto the global contemporary music scene in the early 80s, seamlessly blending different styles, from total serialism to rock.</p>



<p>Finland nurtured his composition career. He joined Sibelius Academy at 15, studying under Paavo Heininen, who fueled his interest in European trends. In 1977, he co-founded Korvat auki with Kaija Saariaho and Esa-Pekka Salonen. In 1980, he founded Toimii Ensemble a creative laboratory that became the birthplace of his innovative compositional experiments.</p>



<p>Mellor (2016) highlights the fascinating evolution of Lindberg&#8217;s compositional style. Over about two decades, he transitioned from an impassioned modernist to a &#8220;mellow composer&#8221; who crafts exquisite orchestral pieces with hints of Romanticism.</p>



<p>After his studies, he travelled to Paris and Berlin, where he discovered punk rock and specifically the German metal band Einstürzende Neubauten. This exposure changed his musical style, turning him into an &#8220;angry modernist,&#8221; (Mellor, 2016) as reflected in his most ambitious composition, Kraft (1985), written for orchestra, electronics, and junkyard percussion. When I heard it, I understood why it is considered such a powerful piece. It radiates tremendous strength, astonishing the listener with its bold changes in dynamics. It brought to mind Stravinsky&#8217;s Rite of Spring, but went even further in terms of instrumentation and a feeling of aggression. While I didn&#8217;t find it as captivating as Rite of Spring overall, there were elements, particularly at the start of each section, that I enjoyed.</p>



<p>In 1994, he composed Aura, a symphony in four movements for a large orchestra. As I listened to each part, I noticed something unexpected—it seemed closer to Rite of Spring rather than moving further away. Interestingly, I even recognized a hint of the famous Rite of Spring rhythm around the ninth minute of the first movement in the recording by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. On the whole, there is a sense of clarity, balance, and harmony that sharply contrasts with Kraft. If I had to guess how Lindberg&#8217;s sound would evolve ten years after Kraft, I would have imagined a greater emphasis on electronic elements rather than acoustic ones. This pleasant surprise increased my admiration for Aura.</p>



<p>In 2002, he created the Clarinet Concerto, which garnered positive reviews from the critics I read. Surprisingly, it is his most popular piece on Spotify. And I can see why. Compared to the previous two compositions, this piece felt more approachable, melodious, and well-structured. The instrumentation has a more traditional quality. It felt like a refined version of Aura. According to Clemments (2005), this single-movement work is sprinkled with allusions to other composers. Although I may not possess the musical knowledge to identify them, I was delighted to recognize the reference to Gershwin&#8217;s Rhapsody in Blue. Actually, that was my favourite part of this piece.</p>



<p>Overall, I was delighted to meet Magnus Lindberg. One thing that stood out in the compositions I listened to was his ability to combine tension/release. His music slowly builds up suspense, and then it bursts forth with pure joy. But what matters to me is how this demonstrates that artists can evolve and freely change their sound without being tied to a specific style. It reminded me of an interview with Rosalía where she says that she couldn&#8217;t do two similar albums because she desires to showcase her diverse emotions across different moments in time. It&#8217;s truly a testament to artistic evolution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tchaikovsky&#8217;s Seasons is probably the less known &#8220;seasons&#8221; of major composers. My opinion is that, because they were composed for a bigger audience, including amateurs, they lack the virtuosity and complexity that pianists prefer in order to showcase their skills.</p>



<p>The collection was composed between November 1875 and May 1876 and commissioned by Nikolay Matveyevich Bernard, the publisher of Le Nouvelliste, a monthly music magazine in St. Petersburg. The intention of the publisher was to release one piece per month, but Tchaikovsky wrote the majority of the pieces between April and May 1876.</p>



<p>In opposition to Vivaldi&#8217;s &#8220;The Four Seasons&#8221;, Tchaikovsky&#8217;s seasons are composed of 12 pieces, each one dedicated to each month of the year, showcasing a glimpse of something characteristic of the month, for example, Carnival (February), The Harvest (August) or Christmas (December).</p>



<p>I would not say that this romantic work is programmatic, but one cannot definitely distance himself from the theme of each piece and hear it as absolute music.</p>



<p>My thoughts after listening to each piece:</p>



<ul>
<li>January: Warm, cosy, and familiar, Evokes a feeling of being at home with the cold outside, warmed by a fireplace and surrounded by loved ones.</li>



<li>February: Playful, cheery, festive. Just like Carnival should be.</li>



<li>March: Melancholic and distant, evoking a sense of reflection for the cold month of March.</li>



<li>April: Charming and optimistic. The end of winter means the start of spring.</li>



<li>May: Serene and tranquil, but warm just like the nights of May.</li>



<li>June: There&#8217;s a certain melancholy in this piece that I find beautiful. It looks like a very romantic piece.</li>



<li>July: The summer spirit is present with a catchy and cheerful tone.</li>



<li>August: The initial and final sections of this piece weren&#8217;t to my liking. It feels chaotic and excessively flourishing for my taste.</li>



<li>September: Majestic and spirited. It resembles a fanfare that complements the eerie ambience of this time of year.</li>



<li>October: Among the pieces in this set, this one evokes a particularly somber mood, but is my favourite. Winter is coming.</li>



<li>November: Somehow, the beggining, reminds me of impressionist pieces. It showcases familiar tunes and notable variations.</li>



<li>December: A refined and courteous waltz-like composition, that brings a warm and festive sensation.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, I think Tchaikovsky successfully captured the essence of each month, while also preserving a sense of coherence throughout the entire composition. It was a fantastic initial listening, and I eagerly anticipate revisiting it in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dark Knight, the second film of the Dark Knight Trilogy, is one of my favourite movies. The reason I love it is that it portrays both the hero and villain as flawed, human characters with blurred lines between good and bad. However, I had never watched it with a focus on the music until now.</p>



<p>Composed by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, the music beautifully captures the duality of the characters. Acoustic instruments (mostly orchestral instruments) dominate when Bruce Wayne appears, while electronic instruments (ranging from electric guitars to synthesizers and audio effects) take over when Batman is present. This stark contrast creates a tranquil atmosphere for Bruce and intense action sequences for Batman.</p>



<p>Intense scenes often feature string ostinati or percussive 16th-note rhythms. Ostinati create sonic continuity when using shorter note values and busy rhythms, they enhance forward momentum and drive.</p>



<p>Despite the complex character development, the main characters&#8217; motifs are remarkably simple. Batman&#8217;s motif consists of two notes (D-F), and the Joker&#8217;s motif is a single note (D). These motifs are strategically used throughout the film to highlight each character&#8217;s presence and convey their essence.</p>



<p>Batman&#8217;s motif, often played by brass with digital effects, brings brightness and hope. It signifies his moments of triumph, like emerging unscathed from the Batmobile crash. On the other hand, the Joker&#8217;s motif, a single note played by a processed cello and razorblade-driven electric guitar, creates a nervy, unsettling feeling akin to an ever-present mosquito. Sometimes the note ascends aimlessly over the D drone, capturing Joker&#8217;s anarchist mindset.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="194" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-1024x194.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1596" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-1024x194.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-300x57.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-768x146.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-640x121.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-960x182.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49.png 1298w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The film&#8217;s core message is that Batman and the Joker are not as different as they seem. Analyzing these motifs made me realize that musically they are related as well.  Both motifs start with the same note, D, but Batman&#8217;s controlled ascent to F contrasts with the Joker&#8217;s anarchic, uncontrollable rise.</p>



<p>This exercise was enjoyable, and it sparked my interest in analyzing how Batman and his villains have been musically portrayed over time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Japanese traditional music, also called hōgaku, is generally defined as all Japanese musical forms from the 10th century,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Japanese traditional music, also called <em>hōgaku</em>, is generally defined as all Japanese musical forms from the 10th century, until the introduction of Western music. But the consensus is that the term <em>hōgaku</em> refers to traditional Japanese music made during or after Japan’s Edo Period (17th to mid-19th centuries) (Sonosky, 2013).</p>



<p>During my research, I found an article by Britten Dean (1985) that discusses Japanese traditional music. According to Dean, unfamiliar Western listeners often perceive it as monotonous, aimless, and shrill. The author attributes this perception to five main differences compared to Western music: monophony, scales, noise, singing, and subtlety. While a detailed explanation can be found in the article, a brief overview is enough to grasp the essential elements of this style.</p>



<p>Traditional Japanese instrumental music features unique instruments such as koto, shamisen (strings meant to be plucked), shakuhachi, fue, shinobue (types of flute), and percussion instruments like shimedaiko, okawa, and kotsuzumi.</p>



<p>Dean mentions that Japanese traditional music follows a long tradition of having a single melody without supporting chords. This can make the music seem thin and lack the progressive harmony that Western listeners expect. It may give the impression of simplicity, but an example provided by the author illustrates the complexity of a single melody. At times, the voice and accompaniment play the same melody but are intentionally desynchronized by a half-beat.</p>



<p>According to Dean, Japanese traditional music primarily relies on the pentatonic scale. This scale is evident in instruments like the five-hole shakuhachi and the tuning of the koto strings. Variations of the pentatonic scale (perhaps the equivalent of Western music modes) often result in a wider interval between the last note of the scale and the tonic, exceeding a whole step. Consequently, the prominence of the leading note is not as anticipated, giving the music a sense of lacking progression and purpose.</p>



<p>Dean also explores the idea of noise, highlighting its contrasting use in Japanese traditional music compared to Western music. While noise is typically avoided in Western music, it serves as an artistic expression in Japanese traditional music. For instance, when the shamisen&#8217;s string is struck by the plectrum, a subtle clicking sound is produced. Contemporary composers even push the boundaries by incorporating intentional beating and pounding of instruments to create a diverse range of sounds. Although these sounds may appear dissonant, they harmoniously blend with the music and are aesthetically pleasing.</p>



<p>Japanese traditional music is also known for its prominent vocal element, as the majority of compositions are sung. Unlike in Western music, Japanese singers do not focus on projecting their voices because there are fewer accompanying instruments. Furthermore, a convention dictates that singers should refrain from showing their teeth. As a result, Japanese singing is characterized by a gentle delivery and a narrower range of vocal dynamics compared to Western music.</p>



<p>Finally, subtlety is a prominent aspect of Japanese traditional music. In the past, hōgaku was intended for intimate settings with small audiences in compact spaces. As a result, the contrast in volume is minimized, and the extremes of the dynamic range are consciously avoided. This creates a sense of consistent and stable music, where the surprises lie within the subtle details.</p>



<p>In the end, I came to understand that while these features strongly contrast with Western music, there is one aspect that stands out as even more remarkable and contrasting. Traditional Japanese music has remained nearly unchanged for nine centuries, while Western music has undergone constant evolution. This leads me to believe it is a music deeply rooted in tradition, embracing gradual enhancements, and upholding a profound reverence for past composers.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Having familiarized myself with the notable aspects of hōgaku, I am now able to appreciate them through actual listening, as demonstrated in the aforementioned example. Sankyoku, a musical form involving a koto player who also sings, accompanied by a samisen and a shakuhachi, allows me to perceive the delicacy, ethereal quality, seemingly spontaneous nature, and monophonic texture. Moreover, I find it intriguing to observe the lack of synchronization between the vocals and instruments, a detail that had previously eluded my attention.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>After exploring additional compositions, I discovered that hōgaku possesses a wonderful sense of serenity, seriousness, and contemplation while maintaining a delicate balance and lightness.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There is no music that can be classified as inherently good or bad. In my perspective, art defies&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is no music that can be classified as inherently good or bad. In my perspective, art defies the notion of being labelled as incorrect. Poems, dances, sculptures—they can&#8217;t be deemed as wrong. The same applies to music; there is no right or wrong. Its value lies in the connection it forges with the listener. Interestingly, this notion was shared with me by a 19-year-old person I had a conversation. When I inquired about their perception of good and bad pop music, they responded by saying that good music must have a captivating rhythm and powerful meaning to themselves.</p>



<p>Considering this, it is really hard for me to tell what makes pop music good or bad. However, it is easier for me to distinguish between pop music I feel is relevant to me and the ones that don&#8217;t.</p>



<p>A truly good or relevant pop song must possess a blend of remarkable melodies, seamless harmonic progressions, grab the listeners&#8217; attention in the first seconds, and incorporate repetition. Above all, it should offer a touch of innovation, presenting a fresh perspective to the realm of music, thereby paving the way for future compositions.</p>



<p>My favourite example of pop music is Queen&#8217;s Bohemian Rhapsody. Despite being classified as Rock Music, it is also recognized as Progressive Pop due to its incorporation of various features from the Progressive Rock genre, including dramatic contrasts and frequent tempo shifts. Astonishingly, they managed to merge the three distinct sections of the song seamlessly, resulting in a cohesive piece with catchy melodies, captivating instrumentals, and powerful lyrics. For that reason, it is regarded as one of the most important songs of all time. Each time I listen to it, I am amazed by how effortlessly they transition between sections while still maintaining their distinctiveness. Furthermore, it has another remarkable feature for a pop song: it clocks in at nearly 6 minutes, yet it never feels lengthy.</p>



<p>Another example of excellent pop music, though in a contrasting genre, is Los Del Rio&#8217;s Macarena, specifically the Bayside Boys remix. This song epitomizes pop music at its finest. It dominated the charts in 1996 and even secured the No. 7 spot on Billboard&#8217;s All-Time Top 100 in 2012. With its catchy melody, simple two-chord harmony, and a blend of clave rhythm and techno beats, this song is undeniably pop. The Spanish-English lyrics are lively and empowering to women, contributing to the girl power movement alongside the Spice Girls. Furthermore, it had a lasting impact on Latin music for years to come. While it may not align with my taste nor be a song I would listen to repeatedly, I acknowledge that it possesses all the qualities of exceptional pop music.</p>



<p>A more recent example of great pop music is SZA&#8217;s Kill Bill, released in 2022. This song was an immediate success, spending 19 weeks in the top three of Billboard&#8217;s Hot 100. Its most remarkable aspect is the contrast of a truly beautiful melody with dark lyrics. This contrast is enhanced by an exquisite introduction, a captivating boom-bap rhythm, and simple harmonies. The song, superficially, sounds like a simple pop song but going into the complex composition, we find that it deviates from the typical structure and incorporates intentionally off-key instruments. It is this innovative compositional work that attracts me to the song, and it will likely serve as a trendsetter for similar music in the future.</p>



<p>Conversely, bad or irrelevant pop music is predictable, recycling previous musical forms, and attempting to ride the success trends of its time. In other words, it becomes excessively formulaic.</p>



<p>A recent example of a poor pop song is Meghan Trainor&#8217;s Mother. Following the success of her earlier hit, All About That Bass, which showcased innovative lyrics and messaging, Trainor attempted to replicate that triumph by creating a song that adheres almost identically to the formula of her previous success. It features the same rhythm, and excessively polished sound, and utilizes a familiar melody to increase its appeal. As a result, it comes across as mechanically produced, lacking the artist&#8217;s artistic vision, ultimately rendering it disposable.</p>



<p>Another instance is Rebecca Black&#8217;s Friday. Although it achieved tremendous popularity, it is widely regarded as one of the worst-recorded songs. The lyrics are superficial, the vocals are heavily processed with autotune, and the instrumentation feels synthetic. It is a song that becomes predictable from the very beginning and, in my opinion, it remains relevant today, but solely for its negative quality.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I believe that there are no inherently good or bad songs. However, certain characteristics differentiate the significance and relevance of music throughout the history of pop music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Composed in 1888, Gymnopédie No. 1 is one of three piano pieces. The term &#8220;gymnopédie&#8221; refers to a dance performed by young men in ancient Greece, characterized by their nudity. Satie&#8217;s music beautifully captures a sense of ethereal beauty and melancholic nostalgia.</p>



<p>As I learned in my previous studies, Satie influenced Debussy in rejecting the conventions and rules of the era. Gymnopédie No. 1 holds great historical significance as it marked a departure from the prevailing Romantic style of that time.</p>



<p>The composition revolves around a single musical idea, depicted in the image below. To me, it resembles a steady heartbeat that pervades the entire piece, setting its rhythm and atmosphere. Throughout the composition, I anticipated an eruption or a contrasting texture, like in Debussy&#8217;s Clair de Lune, but it never arrived. Even the melody lacks such contrast, with the only variety stemming from the harmony.</p>

<p>Interestingly, upon initial listening, the melody seems simplistic and somewhat predictable, while the harmonies are surprisingly unexpected. Although I couldn&#8217;t find a tonal centre, the music appears to shift between D Major and G Major, introducing delightful contrasts, such as the A minor.</p>

<p>After several listens, I find the music to be ethereal, creating a contemplative and soothing experience. The choice of the piano as the instrument contributes to this sensation, as it conveys tranquillity more effectively than an orchestra, such as Debussy&#8217;s orchestration. The absence of a narrative or progression in the music makes me wonder whether Satie paved the way for ambient music.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Defining pop music proves to be a more challenging task compared to defining classical music. The scope of classical music encompasses a wide range of definitions. For instance, Oxford Dictionaries defines classical music as &#8220;music written in a Western musical tradition, usually using an established form (for example a symphony).&#8221; Personally, I perceive classical music in a broader sense, encompassing compositions performed by traditional acoustic instruments without a vocal melody. On the contrary, pop music transcends the confines of a singular genre. Pop music, at its core, is music that is appreciated by a mass audience. When looking at the Music Genres Wikipedia entry, we discover that popular music encompasses numerous genres, with pop music serving as a sub-genre with dozens of genres in itself. As a result, the genres that constitute pop music have undergone continuous evolution since the mid-1950s. For instance, during the 1950s, rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll dominated the pop music scene, while in the early 1990s, Latin music took centre stage, and in the late 2000s, dance music emerged as a prominent force.</p>



<p>The main clash in the definition of pop and classical music is highlighted in the Oxford Dictionary of Music. According to the dictionary, &#8220;since the late 1950s (&#8230;) pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus[ic]&#8221; (Kennedy, 1994:686). This definition raises intriguing questions. Does it imply that there are only two distinct genres of music? Does it suggest that classical music can never attain the status of popular music?</p>



<p>Among the various articles I read on this topic, the one written by James O. Young, titled &#8220;How Classical Music is Better than Popular Music&#8221; (2016)  struck a chord with me. Although I must admit that I do not agree with the title, I agree with the article&#8217;s main argument. Young states that, in general, classical music is more expressive than pop music because it possesses more expressive resources. Classical compositions often boast a broader range of harmonic resources, including complex chord progressions, intricate counterpoint, and rich orchestration, thereby increasing their potential for &#8220;psychological insight and profundity&#8221; (Young, 2016).</p>



<p>For me, Young&#8217;s perspective can be summarized as variety.  Classical compositions tend to have fewer repetitions and more unexpected progressions compared to popular music. Given that the latter is tailored to a wide audience, it&#8217;s unsurprising that they have more repetitions and basic harmonic structures to make it easier to listen, memorize and enjoy. That makes me wonder if this is why modulation is becoming rarer in popular music.</p>



<p>Given this, it&#8217;s not surprising that classical music is frequently seen as superior to popular music. Usually, people tend to think that complex works are better than simpler ones, but this is a subjective belief that might not be entirely accurate. Creating something simple that resonates with a wide audience is a difficult task, and creating complexity just for the sake of it might not turn it into an interesting work.</p>



<p>When it comes to art, I tend to appreciate simpler works. I truly believe that simple art is not an easy art. When faced with Rococo architecture and Bauhaus buildings, my preference leans towards the latter. The same with painting, poetry and music. I find it truly captivating when an artist can express their perspectives and emotions through the simplicity of their art, thereby engaging a wider audience that may otherwise be pushed away from complexity.</p>



<p>In summary, I don&#8217;t believe that the question of good and bad music applies to a discussion about what differentiates popular music and classical music. These are two music genres, each encompassing multiple subgenres, with unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Classical music is expected to exhibit greater expressiveness, diversity, and intellectual depth. Popular music is expected to have the ability to appeal to a large audience and to be more accessible to composers. Given the choice, I would opt for pop music due to its democratic nature, benefiting both composers and listeners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trying to define music is a rabbit hole that many musicologists, ethnomusicologists, philosophers, musicians, music students, and others alike, have fallen. Researching through Google and the UCA Library has confirmed this observation. The nature of music is inherently subjective, and it is as hard as attempting to define any other form of art.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it is a great exercise to do, especially when starting this unit.</p>



<p>To kick off this exercise, I went into the world of other people&#8217;s music definitions. I hopped from dictionary entries to books, interviews, essays, and opinion articles. Among the definitions I found, some were analytical and detached, such as the Concise Oxford Dictionary&#8217;s description as &#8220;the art of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion.&#8221; Other definitions had a philosophical tone, such as Beethoven&#8217;s perspective that &#8220;Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy.&#8221; I also encountered spiritual viewpoints, like Charlie Parker&#8217;s belief that &#8220;Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom.&#8221; I even came across thought-provoking definitions, such as Frank Zappa&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;Anything can be music.&#8221;</p>



<p>This helped form my own opinion about how I would define music. </p>



<p>Music can be characterized by elements that are relatively easier to define, such as rhythm, melody, and harmony. These components are concrete, measurable, and easy to categorize. And we can indeed say that if these elements are present, it can be identified as music. However, deep down, I intuitively know that music is much more than the sum of those elements. Music transcends the boundaries of its components. So, what is music?</p>



<p>In order for music to exist, it requires three essential participants: the composer, the performer, and the listener. Interestingly, these roles can sometimes be fulfilled by the same person. Think of a pianist improvising alone in a room. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the composer and performer don&#8217;t need to be exclusively human. Take the example of a bird joyfully singing its song. Yet, when it comes to the listener in this trio, it must be a human being. A bird cannot claim to be truly listening to music, as it lacks the rational capacity to understand the emotional impact behind the composition and performance. Only a human listener has the rational ability to identify and appreciate the emotional effect that those sounds, can have. Thus, I maintain that the definition of music is largely shaped by the listener rather than just by the sounds.</p>



<p>Of course, it is fair to say that this definition could be challenged, considering that people who are deaf cannot physically hear music. However, they possess the remarkable ability to perceive and discern the presence of music through alternative means, such as vibrations. That is precisely why I intentionally used the term &#8220;listen&#8221; instead of &#8220;hear.&#8221; A deaf person can listen to music by other meanings other than using their ears. </p>



<p>If I were to draft an analytical and impartial definition of music, it would say that music is a compilation of sounds crafted by a composer and executed by a performer, which holds emotional significance for a human listener.</p>



<p>However, personally, I find myself drawn to a definition that carries a touch more spirit. Ultimately, I gravitate towards the perspective offered by Frank Zappa. I would say that music is anything that the listener decides is music.</p>
