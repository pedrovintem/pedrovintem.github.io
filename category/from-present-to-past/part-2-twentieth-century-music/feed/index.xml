										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This part of the course was challenging, but the end result made it all worth it. I never expected to spend so much time on it, especially since I have a full-time job and two young children. However, I can’t say that I regret the time spent because it was well worth it.</p>



<p>One of the most interesting aspects of this part was studying how composers in the 20th century started breaking the established conventions of tonality and harmony. It’s also interesting to see how this connects to major events like the World Wars.</p>



<p>Most of my time was spent diving deep into research for this assignment. I followed the advice of choosing a style that I was not familiar with, so I decided to focus on microtonal music. Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed learning about this style even though it challenged every notion and expectation that I had about its music.</p>



<p>For my research, I had one big question in mind for this assignment. How does microtonality improve the expressiveness of music? And the answer is clear: microtonality gives composers a wider range of pitches and harmonies to use. The effect is a more nuanced feel that’ll create diverse musical effects. It’s almost as if you gave a painter an even bigger palette of colours. Essentially, it allows music to have stronger emotions and meanings.</p>



<p>In my assignment, I think I was able to present my findings in an easy way to understand. However, I think there’s definitely still more to learn about this topic that wasn’t covered here. One thing is for sure, microtonalist composers liked to use this as a way to explore new ways of expression. And we can definitely see that in their work ranging from Carrillo to Collier.</p>



<p>For me, the biggest discovery was the connection between microtonality and the human voice. As Partch demonstrated in his opera King Oedipus, microtonality can capture the natural inflexions and variations of the voice that aren&#8217;t limited to 12 tones. This makes it a powerful tool for expressing human emotion and experience.</p>



<p>One question that still lingers in my mind is: is microtonal music a style or technique? On one hand, there are complete musical pieces composed entirely with microtonal intervals which suggests that microtonality is a distinctive style. Then, on the other hand, I learned that it can be used in any genre or style as an expressive tool. Maybe it’s both depending on how it’s applied and perceived.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I think this research was valuable because I was able to appreciate and understand microtonal music better. Plus, it inspired me to try composing my own music using microtonal intervals. Which should be easier with today&#8217;s technology.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Microtonal music doesn&#8217;t have a universally accepted definition. For example, The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Microtonal music doesn&#8217;t have a universally accepted definition. For example, The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians discusses microtones but not microtonal music (Ader, 2020). But it generally refers to using musical notes between the standard intervals.</p>



<p>The lack of consensus may be because microtonality has wide applications &#8211; from subtle timbre changes to entirely new sounds challenging traditional concepts of harmony and melody. But what is true about it is that microtonal music has the potential to broaden music&#8217;s expressive range. Dividing tones into fractions under a semitone allows composers to create new harmonies, melodies, and textures, evoking more emotions and ideas, and accurately simulating non-Western music.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that discussing microtonal music risks being too Western-centric. Equal temperament is the main tuning in Western popular music (Carlos, 1987). However, most world music, past and present, uses larger or smaller intervals than a semitone. Microtonality is integral to music cultures like Arab maqamat, African traditional, Indian classical shruti, Indonesian gamelan, Chinese, and more &#8211; each with unique tuning systems (Geer, 2014).</p>



<p>The microtonality found in many traditional musical traditions is often intuitive, based on the natural harmonics of instruments and the human voice. In contrast, the development of microtonality in Western music in the early twentieth century was more theoretical and experimental.</p>



<p>Ader defends that the fragmentation that occurred in the world of art during the early twentieth century was a major catalyst for the development of microtonality in music (2020). This was due to the breaking down of traditional forms in poetry and visual arts, which drove artists to explore the essence of their art forms, challenge conventions, and find new modes of expression. Poets began to focus on phonemes and sound, while visual artists dismantled traditional structures. This spirit of experimentation and focus on the most elemental components of an art form also inspired composers to explore microtonality.</p>



<p>Several composers explored microtonality, including Ivan Wyschnegradsky, Ferruccio Busoni, Charles Ives, and Ben Johnston. Alois Hába, Harry Partch, and Julián Carrillo represent slightly different perspectives and are worth discussing further.</p>



<p>Alois Hába (1893-1973), a Czech composer, teacher, and theorist, was a microtonal music pioneer. He grew up in Moravia, where he was influenced by local folk music and subsequently developed an interest in microtones (Forkert, 2020:79). Further encouraged by composers like Ferruccio Busoni and Hermann Scherchen, Hába created his own quarter-tone system, aiming to enhance tonality rather than replace it. As a teacher and theorist at the Prague Conservatoire, he educated many in microtonal composition and advocated for tonality preservation while using microtones. His compositions, including quartets, operas, and chamber music, blended tonal and microtonal elements in a distinct sound. His immense contribution to microtonal music influenced many composers, marking important milestones in 20th-century music.</p>



<p>Harry Partch (1901-1974) was an American just intonation pioneer. He was inspired by a German physicist’s book, leading him to create over 30 custom instruments for a 43-note octave scale, compared to the conventional 12-note. His pursuit led him to create over 30 custom musical instruments capable of producing a scale with an impressive 43 notes per octave, a significant departure from the conventional 12-note octave found on the piano. He invented his own notation system to represent the microtones in his music (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, no date). Partch’s motivation was to emulate the fluidity and expressive range of the human voice, which he believed was inadequately represented by traditional scales. Throughout his life, Partch remained dedicated to pushing the boundaries of music, challenging established norms, and exploring the untapped potential of sound. His enduring legacy is preserved at institutions like the Harry Partch Institute at the University of Washington, where musicians and enthusiasts continue to study, perform, and even recreate his innovative instruments.</p>



<p>The Mexican composer Julián Carrillo (1875-1965) claimed to have discovered microtones in 1895 by dividing violin strings into sixteenths. However, he did not compose microtonal music until 1922 when he became aware of the European microtone scene. Carrillo then developed an elaborate microtonal system called Sonido 13 that divided the octave into quarter tones and smaller intervals. He promoted Sonido 13 as a revolutionary break from the 12-tone octave that would destroy existing music, in contrast to European composers who saw microtones as an extension of tradition. Carrillo also theorized his system extensively in books and articles, conducting tuning experiments on harps and making conclusions about harmonics and acoustics. Though often aggressive in tone, Carrillo&#8217;s writings laid out a systematic microtonal theory unmatched by his European contemporaries. With Sonido 13, Carrillo sought to assert Mexico&#8217;s claim over microtones against European musical dominance.</p>



<p>The influence of pioneering composers in microtonality has resonated through the years. Contemporary composers, such as Horaţiu Rădulescu, Krzysztof Penderecki, and Ryo Noda, have contributed to notating microtonality into the contemporary musical canon.</p>



<p>Modern Western music has not forgotten microtonality, although it has long been used as an ornamental embellishment to add tension. The most familiar example is the bending of notes, where pitches often end up between the semitone intervals, creating microtones. A more recent example is Hans Zimmer&#8217;s use of microtonal string glissandos in the Joker&#8217;s theme for The Dark Knight soundtrack. The strings rise through several microtones between chromatic pitches, creating an extremely unsettling sound. A similar microtonal string effect occurs at the end of Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;How to Disappear Completely.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although temperament and expanded tunings were not historically adopted by pop and rock musicians, often avoiding them in favour of heavy pitch correction with auto-tune, there has been a recent surge in interest from modern artists. Dua Lipa, Sza, Jacob Collier, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, and They Might Be Giants have incorporated microtones into their music, pushing the boundaries of pop, rock, and electronica.</p>



<p>Technology has played a pivotal role in pushing microtonality into the forefront of music. Software like Ableton Live has made it easier to integrate microtonal tunings (Hart, 2016). This has led many microtonal EDM musicians to craft their own tunings, seeking new intervals and sonorities beyond conventional tuning systems.</p>



<p>Ultimately, microtonal music has the potential to enlarge the expressive potential of music by adding finer nuances and more complex language. By dividing the usual Western twelve-tone scale into smaller intervals it is possible to arrive at new harmonies and melodies unavailable within the common system. This creates more varied emotional expressions and new sound textures and colours. Comparable to how unquantized percussion revolutionised hip-hop in the 1990s, microtonality can contradict listeners&#8217; assumptions, creating tension and release different from what is possible within the established Western system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul></ul>



<p>I must admit, prior to this, I was unfamiliar with Partch so this is my initial experience listening to any of his compositions. Partch was indeed a uniquely creative artist, as he was known for not only inventing his own musical instruments but also scoring his compositions for a 43-tone scale unique to these instruments.</p>



<p>Despite being created over 70 years ago (1950), this piece remains surprisingly fresh and innovative. The composition is marked by its distinct sound, thanks to the use of Partch&#8217;s own instruments like the Bass Marimba and the Hypobass.</p>



<p>Although the microtonal melodies and harmonies of the piece often sounded to me as dissonant and jarring, it&#8217;s the unsettling sound contrasted with the comical visual of the instruments that makes it so unique. The sonata is a satirical work going into themes of madness, delusion, and paranoia.</p>



<p>This composition thoroughly blends humour and lightness with hints of darker territories. The lyrics of the piece might seem nonsensical on the surface, but they carry potential interpretations concerning the human condition.</p>



<p>Listening to &#8216;Sonata Dementia&#8217; is a challenging experience. The microtonality might initially seem daunting, but it may not be as intricate as expected. The initial dissonance from the 43-tone scale, which might seem hard to accept at first, gradually becomes more harmonic and natural as the pieces develop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently listened to some parts of King Oedipus, an opera composed by Harry Partch. I was drawn to listen to it because of the information about how Partch started to dive into microtonality, as it more closely resembles the natural human voice. This actually makes total sense for opera. People don&#8217;t speak in 12 semitones, but actually in hundreds of microtones and opera relies heavily on the expression of the voice. As I listened to King Oedipus, I noticed how the voices sounded more like speech than singing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partch&#8217;s music for King Oedipus is a unique blend of microtonality, percussion, and spoken word. The voices sound more natural, not sung, but spoken. The instruments follow the vocals and strangely don&#8217;t sound as strange as they do in other microtonal pieces by Partch. The microtonality allows the voices to more closely match natural speech patterns, rather than conforming to the 12 notes of standard Western music. I enjoyed listening to King Oedipus, even though I did not hear the whole opera. It was a refreshing and stimulating experience that opened my ears to new possibilities of musical expression.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Julian Carrillo&#8217;s Seis casi-sonatas en cuartos de tono para violoncello solo, performed by Gerardo Gimenez Cacho, offers a fascinating glimpse into the expressive potential of microtonal music. As someone accustomed to the familiar 12-tone equal temperament of Western classical music, I found these quarter-tone sonatas surprisingly easy to listen to and appreciate. The solo cello format helps make the microtones feel intimate rather than jarring.</p>



<p>With these sonatas, I could understand how dividing the octave into smaller intervals can open up new sonic palettes and colours. Microtonality provides the performer access to the &#8220;cracks between the keys&#8221; &#8211; those poignant notes that float between our conventional Western pitches. The cello seems to emote in ways that would be impossible with merely 12 notes.</p>



<p>I cannot imagine how difficult these pieces must be to perform well, given the challenge of precisely nailing pitches outside of the equal temperament celloists spend years mastering. The skill demonstrated in this recording is hugely impressive.</p>



<p>Occasionally the quarter tones sound somewhat unsettling, but more often I found they enhanced the cello&#8217;s innate expressiveness. For example, the aching melody in the third movement of Sonata No. 4 attains an extra sadness from its microtonal sounds. The result is something simultaneously familiar and novel.</p>



<p>The quarter tones may initially sound like &#8220;out of tune&#8221; notes, but one&#8217;s ear quickly adjusts, and their emotional resonance becomes apparent. Julian Carrillo has created a compelling showcase for the cello as an instrument of uncommon subtlety. Even for listeners new to microtonality, these Casi-sonatas offer an accessible and rewarding introduction.</p>

<p>Listening to Jacob Collier&#8217;s &#8220;In The Bleak Midwinter&#8221; was an enlightening experience for me as I researched microtonality in modern music. As one of the most talented young musicians today, Collier&#8217;s ingenious use of microtones immediately drew me in. The track begins deceivingly simple but slowly builds in complexity. At one point, Collier modulates to what sounds like a G#. However, with microtonal inflexions, he has actually modulated to the key of G half-sharp major &#8211; something I did not detect on the first listen! The modulation is brilliantly executed, such that the music flows seamlessly.  I had to understand how he modulated and David Bruce helped me on that.</p>

<p>As I re-listened and focused on the microtonal shift, I better appreciated Collier&#8217;s technical mastery and innovative musicality. &#8220;In The Bleak Midwinter&#8221; proves he is not just one of the best musicians of our time, but one boldly expanding the boundaries of Western music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Radiohead is not a band that I particularly enjoy listening to, but I decided to listen to How to Disappear Completely to hear its use of microtonality. </p>



<p>The song starts off with a simple guitar and Thom Yorke&#8217;s falsetto vocals, nothing too unusual for a Radiohead track. The lyrics are vague and ambiguous, but they convey a sense of detachment and dissociation from reality. The song gradually builds up with layers of orchestral strings, guitar effects, and electronic sounds, creating a rich and complex sonic landscape. About two-thirds of the way through, the strings come in playing microtonal intervals that clash with the conventional instrumentation. These non-standard pitches on the strings create an unsettling, tense atmosphere contrasting with the dreamy opening section. The microtonal strings sound almost like they&#8217;re playing a separate song altogether, weaving an anxious counter-melody against the main chords. </p>



<p>This incoherent effect highlights Yorke&#8217;s lyrics about feeling disconnected from reality. While Radiohead isn&#8217;t my go-to band, I found &#8220;How to Disappear Completely&#8221; an interesting song with the use of microtonality to convey emotional dissociation in music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I enjoyed Ives&#8217; Three Quarter Tone Pieces for Two Pianos more than Hába&#8217;s quarter-tone sonata. The interplay between the two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart, creates an intriguing sense of conversation. One piano is tuned to standard western 12-tone equal temperament, while the other uses quarter tones. At first, they both sound out of tune, which has a quirky, childlike quality. But at moments they harmonize in an unconventional way that sounds oddly &#8220;in tune.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I kept listening, I began to familiarize myself with the microtonal language. The quarter tones initially sound discordantly unfamiliar, but gradually become interesting as my ears adapt. Although the microtonal effect hasn&#8217;t become conventionally pleasing to my ears accustomed to the 12-note scale, I can recognize the inventive nature and derive pleasure from the music on its own merits.</p>



<p>Overall, the quarter-tone pieces demonstrate that microtonality is an acquired taste that requires time to appreciate. The outcome is a captivating sound that I can find enjoyable, even though it hasn&#8217;t fully convinced me.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Strange is the first word that comes to my mind when listening to Hába&#8217;s Sonata for Quarter-Tone Piano,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Strange is the first word that comes to my mind when listening to Hába&#8217;s Sonata for Quarter-Tone Piano, Op. 62. After researching microtonality, I&#8217;ve come to enjoy the concept and composers&#8217; reasons for exploring it. But the truth is my ears are so accustomed to the 12-semitone scale that I initially find microtonal music weird. Recent examples in rock and jazz, like King Gizzard and Jacob Collier, are growing on me. Yet even in the slower, more lyrical second movement of Hába&#8217;s sonata, I struggle to fully appreciate the quarter tones. </p>



<p>Making an effort to keep an open mind, I can sense the pioneering spirit of discovery in Hába’s quarter-tone innovations. They impart an otherworldly, dreamlike quality as my ear gradually adjusts. But my long familiarity with 12-tone equal temperament means microtones continue to sound strange at first, even as I recognize their creative possibilities. However, after listening to it more carefully, I started to notice there&#8217;s some beauty and subtlety of the quarter tones. The sonata has a lot of variation and contrast that I can see me appreciating it the more I listen to it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While graphic scores may seem like an unfamiliar concept to many, they hold profound importance in the world of music composition. Rather than using traditional musical notation, graphic scores convey musical instructions through abstract symbols, shapes and colours &#8211; offering more openness to interpretation between composer and performer. </p>



<p>One of the earliest known uses of graphic notation can be seen in the 15th-century score &#8220;Belle, Bonne, Sage&#8221; by Baude Cordier. Crafted in the shape of a heart, it was a pioneering example of &#8220;eye music&#8221; &#8211; utilizing the visual design of the score as part of the composition. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="1024" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-795x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1707" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-795x1024.png 795w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-233x300.png 233w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-768x990.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-300x387.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-640x825.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1.png 838w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></figure>



<p>Modern graphic notation truly emerged in the 20th century. Morton Feldman&#8217;s 1950 work &#8220;Projection 1&#8221; for solo cello featured scores that resembled abstract art or circuit diagrams more than standard sheet music. It showcased a trully visual innovation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="850" height="253" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1709" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2.png 850w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2-300x89.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2-768x229.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2-640x190.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></figure>



<p>What fascinates me most about graphic scores is their versatility. Some composers provide detailed guidelines to steer performers towards a specific vision, like George Crumb&#8217;s illuminating score for &#8220;Agnus Dei [SYMBOL]&#8221;, which is less abstract and relies on traditional notation symbols.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="639" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-1024x639.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1711" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-1024x639.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-300x187.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-768x479.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-1536x958.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-2048x1278.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-640x399.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-960x599.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4.png 2436w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>However, others opt to leave symbols purposefully vague, inviting creative dialogue between visual structure and a performer&#8217;s artistic sensibilities. Cornelius Cardew&#8217;s massive &#8220;Treatise&#8221; is a stunning example, offering no instructions on interpretation or instrumentation across its 193 pages.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="638" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1024x638.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1710" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1024x638.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-300x187.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-768x479.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1536x957.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-640x399.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-960x598.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>More than just an alternative form of notation, graphic scores blur the lines of distinction between visual art and music composition. The visual design becomes an integral part of conveying musical ideas, shedding light on how we perceive and synthesize different modes of art. Some graphic scores can even represent or visualize an existing piece of music, creating a physical manifestation for an otherwise abstract, intangible sound landscape, like for example the work of Nicholas Rougeux.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="966" height="1449" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1712" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited.png 966w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-200x300.png 200w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-683x1024.png 683w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-768x1152.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-300x450.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-640x960.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-960x1440.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As a Led Zeppelin fan, I was eager to check out the band Greta Van Fleet after a friend&#8217;s recommendation. While I enjoyed several of their retro-rock tracks that pay homage to Zeppelin&#8217;s classic sound, the song &#8220;Light My Love&#8221; stood out as my favourite.</p>



<p>The piano melody at the start sets up an interesting intro, but after a few bars, the song explodes into a full-on rock explosion. The lead singer, Josh Kiszka, has a voice that sounds remarkably similar to the legendary Robert Plant &#8211; soaring and crystalline one moment, then shifting into joyful wails that drive the energy ever higher.</p>



<p>Though the chorus repeats in typical pop fashion, the anthemic sound of guitars and drums keeps it from being repetitive. Kiszka unleashes some spectacular high screams that electrify the lyrics. Overall, while Greta Van Fleet wears their influences proudly, &#8220;Light My Love&#8221; shows they can also craft an exhilarating retro-rock song that stands on its own. For a Led Zeppelin fan like me, it left me eager to hear more from this talented young band.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I really enjoy Steve Reich&#8217;s Clapping Music. It&#8217;s a creative and fascinating piece that uses only clapping to build intricate rhythms. There are no harmonies or melodies—just two performers clapping.</p>



<p>The background of this composition is also interesting. In 1972, Reich was inspired by a flamenco duo&#8217;s clapping patterns in Brussels and decided to apply his compositional technique called phasing to clapping. This resulted in a piece that became a major milestone in Reich&#8217;s career and helped reinforce Minimalism as a fresh perspective after the complexity of atonality.</p>



<p>The piece has clear instructions for the performers. The two performers begin clapping their assigned patterns in unison. One performer maintains their pattern unchanged, while the other performer gradually shifts their pattern ahead by one eighth-note at a time. This process of phase shifting creates a polyrhythmic texture as the parts drift apart. It&#8217;s hypnotic to hear the simple claps interweave. As the patterns phase apart, the texture grows denser and more energetic. When they realign, it&#8217;s satisfyingly resolved.</p>



<p>I admire how Reich does so much with something so basic. The phasing technique adds great depth to something so simple. The repeating patterns make me feel meditative and mindful. It&#8217;s always surprising to hear the different rhythms emerge. The subtle changes keep me engaged throughout the almost 5 minutes . This music shows Reich&#8217;s skill with rhythm and repetition: using just claps, he creates music that is complex and trance-like. Ultimately, I believe the piece serves as a creative study of musical texture and rhythm using only the fundamental human instrument: the clap.</p>



<p>One final small detail: At the end of a live performance, the audience uses the same instrument as the performers. I believe it&#8217;s the only piece of music where this happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Shostakovich faced inte­nse criticism and potential perse­cution from Soviet authorities for his controversial ope­ra, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. In response­ to Stalin&#8217;s anger at a performance of the opera, Shostakovich withdrew his Fourth Symphony. According to several publications, Shostakovich composed the Fifth Symphony in 1937 to rede­em himself and align with Soviet ide­als. This symphony served as an opportunity for him to showcase his talent while moving away from the avant-garde nature of his music that had previously been denounced.</p>



<p>The final movement&#8217;s different interpre­tations, influenced by the different interpretations of the tempo, have sparked extensive debates. Some conductors prefer to play it faster than others.</p>



<p>Listening to various recordings, a faster tempo such as the recording of Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic tends to convey a sense of forward momentum, a relentless push towards what could be perceived as a triumph. On the other hand, slower performances, like the one conducted by Yevgeny Mravinsky and performed by the Leningrad Philharmonic, allow for the finer details of the piece to sink in. They offer the listener more time to breathe in the music and as a result, the piece sounds more laboured, possibly invoking darker, ominous undertones.</p>



<p>When taking a closer listening, one can understand that, beyond tempo, phrasing and dynamics also shape interpretations about this final movement. I personally like it best when it&#8217;s played at a moderate speed. This lets the music move forward while giving space for the small details. It finds a good balance.</p>



<p>After my research and several listenings, I found that the faster tempo seems to dismiss the turmoil and complexities underpinning this symphony&#8217;s creation. A slower tempo, while adding additional detail and space for interpretation, can add an overemphasized drama.</p>



<p>Given the circumstances under which Shostakovich composed this symphony, it seems more correct to interpret the finale as not a full triumph nor complete despair, but rather an ambiguous commentary reflecting Shostakovich&#8217;s precarious position.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Benjamin Britten&#8217;s opera Peter Grimes premiered at Sadler&#8217;s Wells Theatre in London on June 7, 1945. Britten had begun sketching the work in 1941 while living in America with his partner Peter Pears during WWII. After reading George Crabbe&#8217;s poem &#8216;The Borough,&#8217; Britten felt a surge of inspiration to write an opera set in the Suffolk fishing village of his youth. Though he used Crabbe&#8217;s character Peter Grimes as his protagonist, Britten departed from the poem&#8217;s storyline to craft an original libretto with Montagu Slater. The libretto humanizes Grimes while retaining his inherent violence and ambiguity.</p>



<p>Peter Grimes follows the story of a fisherman named Peter Grimes who is accused of murdering his apprentice boys. The opera explores themes of mob mentality and persecution of outsiders. The use of tonality in &#8216;Peter Grimes&#8217; is characterized by tritone relationships. The opera&#8217;s dramatic movement is generated by tonal progressions between the keys of A and E flat, symbolizing the impossibility of coexistence for Grimes and the Borough. It is this eerie score depicting the inner turmoil of the protagonist Peter Grimes, that lends the emotional power to the opera.</p>



<p>Peter Grimes was hailed as a landmark in British opera when it premiered. The conductor was Reginald Goodall and Peter Pears performed the role of Grimes. It was the first of Britten&#8217;s operas to gain international acclaim and launched his career as one of the leading opera composers of the 20th century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sonatas and interludes for Prepared Piano &#8211; This piece has a strong focus on rhythm. The prepared piano, with objects placed on and between strings, creates an unconventional timbre. Yet within this unique soundworld, Cage constructs an organized and cohesive musical work. I heard some resemblance to Javanese Gamelan music and some parts reminded me of the Rite of Spring.</p>



<p>Imaginary Landscape No. 4 &#8211; Cage&#8217;s first piece of chance music. By tuning radios to different frequencies, chance collages of sounds, speech and music emerge. The juxtaposition of these fragments is unpredictable but often intriguing. It&#8217;s music created by randomness rather than conscious design. Though it abandons traditional musical elements, it has a sense of playfulness and spontaneity that I find amusing.</p>



<p>Roaratorio, an Irish circus on Finnegans Wake &#8211; I found it really hard to enjoy this long composition. Combines field recordings, spoken word, and segments of Irish traditional music into a sound collage. The complex overlays create textures and rhythms. </p>



<p>Regarding serial and chance music, both approaches challenge conventional tonality and require an open mind from the listener. Cage demonstrates that music can emerge from unconventional sound sources, chance procedures and found objects. He accomplished to expand the conceptions of music, art and listening.</p>



<p>The serialist pieces have a very ordered, logical structure that comes through clearly in the listening. The rigid rules of serialism &#8211; avoiding repetition, and ordered rotations through the 12 tones &#8211; result in cerebral, mathematical music.</p>



<p>In contrast, Cage&#8217;s chance music lacks that calculated complexity. The randomness and unpredictability create a more chaotic, spontaneous feel. While the serialist process is evident to the listener, Cage&#8217;s process is opaque. We cannot directly hear compositional systems, but I find this obscure and surprising thought interesting.</p>



<p>I  still believe that my definition of music is still valid in this discussion. While the composer organizes sounds and applies musical techniques, the real art happens in the listener&#8217;s mind. As Cage showed, music can emerge from non-traditional sounds when the listener lends them meaning. My definition recognizes how the listener&#8217;s role gives life and validity to music. Without the listener&#8217;s act of listening, there is no music.</p>



<p>Cage&#8217;s chance pieces may not convey traditional emotional arcs, but they can evoke moods like dissatisfaction, serendipity, and even humour. Serialist works induce intellectual stimulation more than direct emotion. But even in this case, a listener need not comprehend the serial process to be affected by the music&#8217;s dramatic quality.</p>



<p>So while the compositional approach shapes aesthetic effect, I believe music can deliver emotional impact being it systematically composed or leaving it to chance. The listener&#8217;s subjective experience remains central to lending music it meaning.</p>



<p>While the compositional approach undoubtedly shapes the aesthetic effect, I believe music retains the power to deliver emotional impact whether coming from a serialist complexity or Cage&#8217;s randomness. Ultimately, the listener&#8217;s subjective experience remains central to lending music its meaning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I decided to perform John Cage&#8217;s 4&#8217;33&#8221; alone in my living room. I set a timer to keep up track of the time. At first, there was complete silence as I sat motionless on a chair. After about a minute, I started to hear subtle sounds &#8211; the gentle creaking of the wooden floor, distant traffic noises outside, and the occasional sound of myself shifting in their chair. These ambient sounds almost took on a musical quality as I focused intently on listening.</p>



<p>The effect was surprisingly mesmerizing. In the absence of deliberate music, the mundane sounds, often unnoticed, took centre stage, and I immediately understood what Cage intended with this piece.</p>



<p>Around the two-minute mark, the silence was broken by my stomach rumbling loudly. I had to stifle a laugh at this unexpected bodily interjection. A few moments later, a siren wailed in the distance. The juxtaposition of these random noises with the intended silence of the piece was amusing to me.</p>



<p>When the 4 minutes and 33 seconds were up, I felt a sense of accomplishment. Although an audience may have enhanced the experience, performing 4&#8217;33&#8221; alone made me appreciate the musical potential of everyday sounds. I found beauty in the silence between the noises. This piece definitely expanded my perspective on what can be considered music.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There were several composers I could choose from this period. Still, since I have an appreciation for merging&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There were several composers I could choose from this period. Still, since I have an appreciation for merging styles of music, and I always liked Rhapsody in Blue, I decided to investigate George Gershwin&#8217;s work.</p>



<p>George Gershwin (1898 &#8211; 1937), a son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, became inspired to pursue music at a young age. He began writing songs while working for a music publisher in Manhattan’s Tin Pan Alley, which led to his first major hit, “Swanee” in 1916. Gershwin collaboratively wrote some of the most popular songs of the interwar period with his brother Ira, a number of which have remained standards in jazz music such as Summertime, I Got Rhythm and They Can’t Take That Away From Me. Gershwin also composed several renowned classical pieces such as Rhapsody in Blue, and An American in Paris, as well as the opera Porgy and Bess.</p>



<p>To understand the impact of Gershwin&#8217;s work, it&#8217;s helpful to analyse the context of the interwar national identity crisis. After WWI, countries looked to culture to define their identities. However, in the US, this was different. The country had many cultural traditions due to immigration and migration, leading to new musical styles. In 1893, Dvořák thought Black music should be the basis for an American classical style. By the 1920s, African-American genres like ragtime, blues, and jazz were popular nationwide. Gershwin used jazz in Rhapsody in Blue to create a unique American classical piece, that blended European and African American sounds, fulfilling Dvořák&#8217;s idea that Black music could define an American style.  Rhapsody in Blue was commissioned by Paul Whiteman with the intent of “classicizing” jazz to increase its respectability among white audiences. It debuted with Gershwin himself as the piano soloist, with a jazz band and a string section for accompaniment.</p>



<p>Listening to Rhapsody in Blue with this context in mind I can get even more out of the piece. I always loved how it mixed different styles, but now I can see how it blends together European and African-American music in a very special way. I think the piano part really stands out in this, changing from arpeggios and flourishes from Classic European music to more jazzy and bluesy ones.</p>



<p>Another Gershwin song I liked listening to was &#8220;I Got Rhythm&#8221;, which was written by the Gershwin brothers for the Broadway musical &#8220;Girl Crazy&#8221;. During this period, Broadway musicals were an important way to showcase music and were based on European operettas and comic operas. However, they were different as they included spoken dialogue, making them more accessible to everyone.</p>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t listened to it before, and the first time I listened to it, it sounded familiar, as if I had heard it before. After several listenings, I realised it was the syncopation and the call-response so usual in jazz that made it sound familiar. Actually, the chord progression from I Got Rhythm is known as the &#8220;rhythm changes&#8221;, and it&#8217;s the foundation for many other popular jazz tunes. </p>



<p>After realising the impact of this song, I decided to listen to his symphonic work Variations on &#8220;I Got Rhythm&#8221; for Piano and Orchestra. It caught me by surprise. It isn&#8217;t a piece of catchy pop music but it is inventive and, experimental but at the same time there&#8217;s always the jazzy feeling. I felt this could be the base of the development of Raphosy in Blues.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs4vYVdof8bc85dyGfx6svA"></a></p>



<p>Gershwin had a big influence on American music, even though his career was short. His works blended classical, jazz, and popular music, firmly establishing him as a leading figure in American modernism. His Broadway musicals, defied the notion that serious music had to remain distinct from popular culture, proving that meaningful music music could also entertain and be popular. While some classical critics initially questioned his approach, audiences and musicians loved it. His unique approach broke down music style barriers and brought an entire country together since he and others helped create a new American sound.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Maurice Ravel&#8217;s &#8220;Bolero&#8221; is a very well-known piece and is a masterful illustration of both orchestration and gradual development. Repeated continually, its single melody and rhythm manage to avoid monotony. Instead, Ravel uses a diversity of tonal colours, orchestral variation and incremental crescendo.</p>



<p>While not directly related to the music itself, I found Ravel&#8217;s background interesting context. His father was an accomplished inventor who created new machines and early cars. I believe that this exposure to machinery and technology as a child likely influenced Ravel&#8217;s fascination with mechanical sounds and rhythms, as evidenced in Bolero&#8217;s persistent snare drum beat.</p>



<p>Another intriguing aspect is Ravel&#8217;s use of the saxophone, uncommon in orchestral works of the era but prevalent in jazz. After listening, I researched possible jazz influences on Ravel. Indeed, he enjoyed jazz artists like Duke Ellington during a 1928 North American tour. He admired the percussive double bass and brassy glissandi. This openness seemingly inspired his experimentation in Bolero.</p>



<p>I&nbsp;deeply admire Ravel’s orchestration in &#8216;Bolero&#8217;.&nbsp;He fully exploits each instrument&#8217;s unique characteristics. His strategy of introducing the melody using different instruments in succession creates a unique texture and colour for each iteration of the theme. It’s not about a simple increase in the volume that results in the crescendo, but a careful layering of instruments that creates an intensifying texture within the piece.</p>



<p>The brief departure from the tonic key in the final segment of the piece, an unexpected occurrence in a piece that otherwise sticks rigidly to a single key, adds a mesmerising final twist. All the while, the steady percussion and pizzicato strings act as a grounding force, adding even more depth to the enthralling climax.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Varèse&#8217;s &#8220;Amériques&#8221; leaves me with mixed feelings. On one hand, I can appreciate its groundbreaking nature. Composed shortly after he moved to the U.S., you can sense this longing and curiosity, like he&#8217;s exploring new worlds. It&#8217;s wild and dissonant, with these intricate mixtures of percussion and wind instruments.</p>



<p>After hearing it, my definition of what music is hasn&#8217;t changed. I don&#8217;t want to come off as boastful, but I&#8217;m still convinced that music is a blend of sounds designed by a composer,  executed by a performer, which holds emotional significance for a human listener. This composition confirms my belief. Whether this is music or not really depends on the listener&#8217;s interpretation. In my view, it certainly is, although I didn&#8217;t fully appreciate it.</p>



<p>I actually want to appreciate &#8220;Amériques&#8221; for showcasing Varèse&#8217;s innovative spirit. But its interruptive, ever-changing nature also distances me from fully connecting with the music on an emotional level. While groundbreaking for its time, parts of its execution undermine my ability to fully experience what Varèse set out to convey about his new home and surroundings. Overall, I admire what he achieved, but also find myself holding it at arm&#8217;s length musically on repeated listens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;A remarkable step forward on the way towards the ideal of symphonic unity (…) With his fifth symphony Sibelius raises the genre of the symphony to an entirely new cyclic level.&#8221;</p>
<cite><em>Veijo Murtomäki, musicologist, 1990</em></cite></blockquote>



<h4 id="sibelius-symphony-no-5-in-e-flat-major-op-82" class="wp-block-heading">Sibelius&#8217; Symphony No. 5 in E-flat Major, Op. 82</h4>



<p>If there were any doubts about Sibelius being a national treasure even in his lifetime, they were completely dispelled by his 5th Symphony. Commissioned by the Finnish government to celebrate Sibelius&#8217;s 50th birthday – a national holiday – the symphony was premiered on the 8th December 1915, with Sibelius conducting the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. While the premiere in 1915 garnered success, it didn&#8217;t meet Sibelius&#8217;s personal standards. The work was revised twice, in 1916 and 1919, until it got the version we can hear today.</p>



<p>The uniqueness of this symphony lies in its cyclic unity &#8211; perhaps inspired by the cyclic nature of Finnish Folk music &#8211; with motifs recurring and transforming throughout the entire work. Its melodies are influenced by the sparse folk tunes of remote northern regions. The primal cell, heard in the opening horn call, contains the genetic code for all the important themes that follow. Sibelius moulds these themes with tremendous skill, subtly transforming them in each movement yet always retaining their essence.</p>



<p>The emotional pinnacle of the symphony is reached in the finale. Inspired by the sight of sixteen swans in flight, the finale depicts their rustling wings with trembling strings beneath an expansive melody. A majestic &#8220;swan theme&#8221; is introduced by horns. As the work reaches its conclusion, this theme transforms into an exultant shout of triumph.</p>



<p>Today, Symphony No. 5 stands not just as a patriotic reminder of Finland&#8217;s nationalistic spirit, but also stands as one of his finest achievements, capturing both the raw beauty of the Finnish landscape and the meditative spirit it inspired in the composer through its now-legendary &#8220;Swan Hymn.&#8221; Its evocation of the majestic swans continues to move listeners decades after its composition.</p>



<p>Experience the unfolding narrative of this symphony as it tells a mosaic story of a composer, his homeland, and the uncontrollable forces of life itself. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Debussy – Jeux (1912) The ballet&#8217;s title tells the story of a boy and two girls searching for&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4 id="debussy-jeux-1912" class="wp-block-heading">Debussy – Jeux (1912)</h4>



<p>The ballet&#8217;s title tells the story of a boy and two girls searching for a tennis ball but ending up playing other games, some childlike and others romantic. It&#8217;s like a musical mystery, where things change and evolve. The main thing I get from this piece is its fleeting nature. Everything seems brief – short motifs, regular tempo changes, and a lack of stability. But somehow, it all feels connected. When listening, I felt that Debussy was trying to convey a sense of childishness – inconsequential, unfocused, and whimsical. But at the same time, it feels sweet, dreamy, and magical. Strangely for a Debussy piece, there&#8217;s not much dissonance.</p>



<h4 id="stravinsky-the-rite-of-spring-1913" class="wp-block-heading">Stravinsky – The Rite of Spring (1913)</h4>



<p>The Rite of Spring is one of my favourite music pieces. I love its intensity, rough rhythms, and surprises. It begins with a beautiful and iconic bassoon at a higher pitch, which clashes with expectations because one would anticipate an oboe or clarinet playing that folk melody. Throughout the piece, there are unexpected dynamics and rhythms, often relying on dissonance and interruptions. I believe Stravinsky intended to provoke and make the listener uncomfortable, evoking a sense of despair similar to a young girl being sacrificed by dancing herself to death. The use of percussion is crucial for the ballet&#8217;s dance aspect and to convey that feeling of unease.</p>



<p>Interestingly, whenever I hear this piece, it reminds me of metal music concerts, where chaos and loud noises reign. In both the Rite of Spring and metal concerts, the percussive element of the instruments is what moves and excites people. It&#8217;s remarkable how this aspect remains unchanged despite the 100-year difference.</p>



<h4 id="schoenberg-pierrot-lunaire-1913" class="wp-block-heading">Schoenberg – Pierrot Lunaire (1913)</h4>



<p>This was the hardest piece to listen to. The Sprechstimme technique goes against what I was expecting for the vocal melody. This creates a spooky and unsettling feeling that I reckon may go along with the story. The harmony in this music doesn&#8217;t follow the traditional rules and doesn&#8217;t have a clear melody or a familiar pattern. Overall, even though it might have been challenging for me to appreciate this unusual music, I believe it may reveal many interesting and thought-provoking structures that when explored more deeply may be surprisingly creative. At the same time, it&#8217;s really hard for me to understand what impact this piece had on the overall music.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Comparing the three, despite being written just one year apart, they are completely different styles. Looking at today&#8217;s music, I find it refreshing to see that there was a time when the best composers were exploring completely different styles. If I were to give these three pieces a personality, I would say that Debussy&#8217;s is more emotional and sensitive, while Stravinsky&#8217;s is more primal and brute. Schoenberg’s is somehow much less earthly, more imaginative, and surreal.</p>
