										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A master of contrapuntal composition, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina composed 105 masses and 250 motets in the Italian Renaissance. A significant figure in the development of polyphony, he represented the conservatism of the 16th century on the subject of church music.</p>



<p>Though it is widely believed that Palestrina saved polyphony by himself, it is a myth that is widely accepted, although it is also true that the Council of Trent (1545-1563) stressed the importance of musical clarity and Palestrina himself advocated it (Monson, 2002).</p>



<p>Palestrina&#8217;s Missa Brevis (Short Mass) was first published in 1570 and is considered one of his most famous works. There are four voices in the Kyrie (Cantus, Altus, Tenor, and Bassus). With the exception of a brief homophonic section at the end of the second Kyrie, the texture is almost exclusively polyphonic. With a gentle melodic line and simple harmony, this piece stays in F major with only occasional chromatic changes, creating a restful, calm atmosphere.</p>

</h2>



<p>Listen to a recording of the <em>Kyrie </em>from Palestrina’s <em>Missa Brevis </em>and follow with a score.<br>Read the following comments about features of the music, and note an instance where each occurs in the score. You may find it to be most effective if you mark each occurrence onto a printout of the score or annotate a pdf of it electronically. Keep your annotations for reference later.</p>



<ul><li>The entry of each vocal part is in imitation.</li><li>The texture is polyphonic &#8211; consisting of several independently moving, though coordinated, vocal parts.</li><li>The melody lines themselves move smoothly &#8211; mainly flowing by step with occasional leaps but then often turning back and returning to where they came from, or nearby.</li><li>Each part rises and falls, helping to create a sense of direction but with no single part assuming dominance over the others.</li><li>The ranges of the individual voice parts lie mainly within an octave and there is a general sense of balance to the individual melodic lines. They rise and fall in about equal measure, exploring the full range of the voice evenly.</li><li>The words are repeated and are clearly audible. The words overlap, each part at times following, at times leading, to create the musical texture.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<h3 id="claudio-monteverdi-1567-1643">Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643)</h3>



<p>Monteverdi was an Italian composer, violinist, singer, and priest. He is often considered a revolutionary who marked the transition from Renaissance to Baroque music.</p>



<p>Until the age of forty, Monteverdi worked primarily on madrigals, composing a total of nine books. In about four years, Monteverdi completed his first book of twenty-one madrigals for five voices. Overall, the first eight madrigals show the massive development from Renaissance polyphonic to baroque monodic styles.</p>



<p>He wrote L&#8217;Orfeo, one of the earliest operas in the history of music, an innovative work that remains a part of today&#8217;s orchestra&#8217;s repertoire. Additionally, he has written sacred music.</p>



<h3 id="orlando-di-lasso-1532-1594">Orlando di Lasso (1532 &#8211; 1594)</h3>



<p>Lasso was a Franco-Flemish composer. With more than two thousand compositions to his credit, he was a prolific and versatile author. This collection includes all genres of his day, secular and sacred, including the mass, secular chanson in several languages, Latin motets, hymns, and madrigals. When he held the position of Kapellmeister at the Munich court, at the end of his life, he cultivated sacred music with a special dedication.</p>



<p>He is considered the chief representative of the mature polyphonic style of the Netherlands school, along with Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. At the end of the 16th century, he was one of the most famous and influential musicians in Europe.</p>



<p>Regarding his madrigals, which he penned while living in Rome, his style was clear and concise, and his tunes were memorable.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The main reason I chose to compare these two madrigals is their contrasting themes. Lasso&#8217;s one is a jovial, lighthearted, and almost mocking monologue between a German soldier and a supposedly Italian woman. Contrary to Monteverdi, his lament is a sombre recognition of death in late life.</p>



<p>From the very beginning, these contrasting themes are evident.&nbsp;Matona, mia cara begins with all four voices in an F Major chord and in a fast tempo. The song develops with a mostly homophonic texture and a very marked rhythm, especially in the &#8220;Don, don, don&#8221; section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ah, Dolente partita opens with only two voices in unison, singing a long, high E. The two voices stay in unison until bar 4 when they drift apart. As a result, it sounds very sorrowful and enigmatic. As the other voices enter, they do so timidly and not simultaneously. Only in bar 15 do all five voices sing together. However, just after that, in bar 16, the top two voices become silent. This creates a variety of aural experiences that convey the theme of lamentation.</p>



<p>Monteverdi&#8217;s madrigal has a more polyphonic texture than Lasso&#8217;s. Consequently, Ah, Dolente partita has a richer sound ambience, but Matona, mia cara has a stronger rhythmic mark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a final contrast, I would like to mention the melodic shape. In Lasso&#8217;s madrigal, there are some upward and downward lines, with a lot of repetition of the melody, so it could be sung in a group with a dance-like feeling.&nbsp;Monteverdi&#8217;s melody, however, tends to move downward or remain flat, which is most evident towards the end, as if the music is taking small steps toward death.</p>

<p>The chords are G minor, E major, D major, G major, D major, and F# Major.</p>



<h5 id="does-this-chord-progression-call-to-mind-any-music-you-know-from-later-eras">Does this chord progression call to mind any music you know from later eras?<br></h5>



<p>Although it didn&#8217;t sound like anything I&#8217;d heard before, I researched why this progression sounded so good together. One of the hints I found was that Gesualdo used mediant chords and doubly chromatic mediant chords, which indeed is true in this chord progression. E major is a doubly chromatic mediant from G minor. </p>

<h5 id="how-would-you-describe-the-music-in-bb-9-20-and-the-texture-at-bb-40-42">How would you describe the music in bb. 9-20 and the texture at bb. 40-42?</h5>



<p>In bars 9-20, I would describe it as a chromatic imitative counterpoint.</p>



<p>The texture at bb. 40-42 is homophonic.</p>



<h5 id="what-does-the-word-dolore-mean-at-b-55">What does the word ‘dolore’ mean at b. 55?</h5>



<p>It means pain, sorrow, and grief.</p>



<h5 id="in-your-own-words-describe-the-kind-of-harmony-melody-and-texture-that-gesualdo-has-employed-to-carry-its-meaning">In your own words, describe the kind of harmony, melody and texture that Gesualdo has employed to carry its meaning.</h5>



<p>By itself, the word &#8220;dolore&#8221; implies sorrow, but in the context of the text, it can also mean relief.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>&#8220;but a soul without a heart can feel no sorrow.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>If the character dies or at least has his heart figuratively taken away, he becomes numb and cannot feel pain. A relief from the grief associated with the lover&#8217;s departure.</p>



<p>This is why the texture starts out polyphonic and with dissonances and then turns homophonic and consonant. Additionally, the melody creates a U shape. Starting moving downwards, taking the meaning of the word &#8220;dolore&#8221; to inconsolable grief, shifting to a rising melody towards the final G major chord. I interpret this last rising as Gesualdo&#8217;s acceptance of pain as an immutable truth or perhaps a morbid pleasure from the composer suffering from insanity at the end of his life.</p>
