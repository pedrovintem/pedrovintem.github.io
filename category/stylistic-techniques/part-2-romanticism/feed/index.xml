<p>Richard Strauss (1864-1949), a child prodigy with exceptional musical aptitude, composed two symphonies and concertos for horn and violin by the time he was twenty years of age. He hailed from Munich and was the son of Franz Strauss, a celebrated horn player who held Mozart, Beethoven, and Haydn in high esteem as his &#8220;musical trinity&#8221; (Kennedy, 2006).</p>



<p>In 1874, he attended the Ludwigsgymnasium where he studied music theory with Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer, conductor of the Munich Court Orchestra. During his studies with Meyer, Strauss learned about Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn and other classical composers.</p>



<p>By the time Strauss was 18, he had already written around 150 pieces in a conservative style that resembled Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. But at 21, he began to rebel against this traditional sound.</p>



<p>In 1885, he moved to Meiningen to work with Hans von Bülow, a renowned conductor. He learnt about opera from Brahms and perfected his conducting technique, while being exposed to the two main currents of Germanic music at the time. Those advocating &#8220;pure music&#8221; (e.g., Joachim, Hanslick) hailed Brahms&#8217; music and opposed those who propagated &#8220;music of the future&#8221; (e.g., Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner) (Malheiros dos Santos, 2018).</p>



<p>Strauss met Alexander Ritter (1833-1896), a composer and violinist in the Meiningen Orchestra, who had an immense influence on him. An avid follower of Wagner, Ritterer shifted Strauss&#8217; focus from abstract works towards modern orchestral works inspired by literature. This was despite his father&#8217;s disapproval of Wagner&#8217;s music. In 1889, Strauss completed his first mature masterpiece Don Juan (Dotsey, 2019).</p>



<p>The idea behind composing Don Juan was born in 1885, during a performance of Paul Heyse&#8217;s Don Juans Ende in Frankfurt. However, Strauss&#8217; direct source was an incomplete poem from 1851 written by Nicolaus Lenau. In contrast to the classic conception of Don Juan as a rake and impostor, Lenau portrayed him as an idealist searching for ultimate love, eventually becoming discontented with himself.</p>



<p>In his composition of Don Juan, Strauss focused on the individual pursuit of an idealised form of love that perpetually eludes him. This is expressed musically through a continuous rise and fall in emotion that culminates in the protagonist&#8217;s demise by duel.</p>



<p>Strauss wrote Don Juan for a large instrumental ensemble consisting of 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes and English horn, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons and contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, cymbals, glockenspiel, harp, and strings.</p>



<p>Strauss&#8217; structure of Don Juan mirrors the story told by Nikolaus Lenau, beginning with a presentation of the protagonist, followed by two episodes of love affairs and an orgiastic scene which leads to a duel with Don Pedro resulting in his (assumed) death.</p>



<p>At the outset of this piece, Strauss employs the whole orchestra to create a boisterous, heroic rising pattern which adds vigour and propulsion to the main theme.</p>



<p>The initial scene (beginning at 00:56 of the recording I listened to) appears to be the introduction of Don Juan&#8217;s initial conquest and romantic relationship with a woman. There is a duet between the violins (woman) and horns and cello (Don Juan), that culminates in a very interesting and surprising dark climax at G.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="456" height="1024" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08-456x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1057" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08-456x1024.png 456w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08-134x300.png 134w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08-300x674.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></figure>



<p>The second scene (at 05:32) appears to be another conquest by Don Juan, suggesting a greater emotional connection this time. The plaintive flute and especially the endearing oboe melody are employed to convey the ardour of his love. This sentiment ultimately reaches a triumphant high point as the horns play the heroic theme.</p>



<p>The carnival scene (at 10:27) functions as a transitional section as it spirals out of control. It starts with tranquil strings, but quickly gains intensity and creates an intense atmosphere. As the scene progresses, Strauss juxtaposes various iterations of Don Juan&#8217;s theme on top of one another.</p>



<p>The fight scene (at 15:00) maintains the tension built in the preceding scene, ending suddenly to echo Don Juan&#8217;s death at the hands of Don Pedro.</p>



<p>The death scene (at 15:37) is an understated and sorrowful conclusion with the bassoons giving Don Juan a final breath.</p>



<p>Listening to the full piece is clear that Strauss uses the full orchestra and its individual timbres to express Don Juan&#8217;s emotional journey to the audience. At the start, he is portrayed as audacious and confident through sweeping arpeggios and complex orchestration. His love stories are tender and romantic, with Strauss employing range, colour and instrumentation to illustrate the character&#8217;s humanity. He accentuates Don Juan&#8217;s boldness through powerful instruments such as brass while utilising woodwinds to depict his insecurities.</p>



<p>Strauss&#8217; use of dynamics is a notable feature in his composition of Don Juan. As an example, it ranges between ff and fff only for woodwinds, horns, and strings in the A. Another example is the beautiful slow movement in L, which ranges from p to ppp. In addition to conveying the storyline to the listener, this creates an interesting contrast that prevents the music from becoming monotonous.</p>



<p>The exact structure of Don Juan has been a source of detective work for the past century, with the piece being described by some as a free sonata and by others as either a rondo or a fusion between the two (Hepokoski, 1997). Nonetheless, it is clear that Strauss wanted to move away from conventional structures.</p>



<p>Romantic-era composers sought more open ways to express their musical ideas, instead of the strict forms used by classical composers (i.e. Haydn&#8217;s sonata form). With this newfound freedom, they could employ melody, harmony and texture to evoke a narrative, a character or an atmosphere; thus new genres such as Programme Music, Concert Overture and Symphonic Poem were created.</p>



<p>In the collection of his thoughts, Recollections and Reflections, edited by biographer Willi Schuh, Strauss voiced his support for these novel orchestral forms. He stated that “New ideas must seek out new forms for themselves: the basic principle adopted by Liszt in his symphonic works, in which the poetic idea really did act simultaneously as the structural element, became from then onwards the guideline for my own symphonic works.” (Strauss and Schuh, 1974).</p>



<p>Strauss was aware of the pioneering progressions in Programme Music from Liszt, a pianist who revolutionised programme music with his novel genre, the symphonic poem.</p>



<p>The term &#8216;symphonic poem&#8217; describes a programmatic work composed for an orchestra which draws inspiration from a range of outside sources, such as poems, stories and artwork. This style of composition was adopted to meet nineteenth-century aesthetic objectives; by relating music to something non-musical, allowing multiple movements to be combined into one section and raising instrumental program music up to the same level as opera (Macdonald, 2001).</p>



<p>In addition, composers of symphonic poems had the freedom to alter the stories and characters, as Strauss appears to do with Don Juan. It remains uncertain whether he is faithful to Lenau&#8217;s representation, or if he uses melodic themes and orchestral colouring to suggest a character who is more actively engaged with life rather than one who is jaded. This could be described as the enchantment of romanticism in art, expressed by their search for unlimited possibilities in composition which allows listeners to enter into a realm of introspection and imagination rather than being restricted by form.</p>



<p>Strauss also drew much influence from Wagner, particularly in terms of chromaticism, harmonic structures, and the use of leitmotifs. In his composition of Don Juan, this is evident through the varied orchestration and gradual evolution of motifs to evoke drama and emotion. These musical ideas effectively convey the psychological nature of its characters.</p>



<p>It wasn’t just the piece’s structure and the use of the motifs that made Don Juan innovative. The piece demands great technical virtuosity from its performers in terms of range, breath control and virtuosic execution, as in A. This is emblematic of the Romantic era which sought to develop great technical virtuosity.</p>

<p>In summary, Richard Strauss&#8217;s Don Juan is a remarkable example of Program Music from the Romantic era. It displays his aptitude in utilizing various musical elements to convey the protagonist’s inner world whilst simultaneously stirring emotions in its listeners. Through the incorporation of leitmotifs, chromaticism and technically challenging orchestral parts, Strauss has produced a sophisticated and powerful composition that reflects music’s capacity to narrate stories.</p>

<p>Les Préludes is a symphonic poem composed by Franz Liszt and premiered in 1854. His symphonic poem is one of his most famous compositions and is often seen as an example of the genre. This work is based on a poem by Alphonse de Lamartine of the same name that explores ideas of fate and destiny. Liszt uses a variety of musical devices to illustrate Lamartine&#8217;s poem, including changes in tempo and dynamics, harmonic shifts, and orchestral colour.</p>



<p>Liszt&#8217;s use of thematic transformation in Les Préludes is one of the most striking aspects of the work. Thematic transformation is a compositional technique whereby a musical theme is altered or transformed in order to create a distinct idea or mood. In Les Préludes, Liszt uses this technique to great effect, transforming the main theme of destiny into several different musical ideas that represent different aspects of the poem.</p>



<p>Beginning with three notes (C-B-E), the piece is a dreamy introduction. In a thematic transformation, this motif will be repeated throughout the work. Using this single motif, the music moves from a dawn of enchantment to a tumultuous battle to a triumphant ending.</p>



<p>My first experience listening to Liszt&#8217;s Les Préludes was incredibly moving. With Liszt&#8217;s use of thematic transformation, I could really feel the tension that he had created, although sometimes it was challenging to discern where the main theme was. I really like this piece of music.</p>

<p>Luís de Freitas Branco was a Portuguese composer, musicologist, and professor of music who played a pre-eminent part in developing Portuguese music in the first half of the 20th century. He wrote over 150 pieces of music, including orchestral works, chamber music and works for the stage, as well as songs and choral works. Suite Alentejana No. 1 is one of his most famous works and is known for its energetic rhythms, colourful orchestration and vibrant melodies.</p>



<p>The piece is written for a large orchestra with 3 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, castanets and harp, as well as strings.</p>



<p>Luís de Freitas Branco&#8217;s Suite Alentejana No. 1, written in 1919, is a celebrated work that demonstrates his preference for the Alentejo region of Portugal. Personally, the third and final movement, known as the Fandango, stands out for its vibrant energy and eloquent orchestration. It is written for orchestra with elements of folk music from Alentejo such as a binary-metered rhythm and castanets incorporated into the piece. The form of the piece is tripartite (A-B-A), with an English horn solo leading to a choral section in between two energised sections featuring returning themes. As we close the Fandango brilliantly, the exuberance and vigour of the first section return.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Chopin: Nocturne No. 3 in B Major, Op. 9, No. 3" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0NCRKFajfFE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Maria João Pires&#8217; performance was the first I heard. The dynamic range is quite wide and there is a lot of rubato. It seems that she plays faster prior to the louder dynamics and slower prior to the quieter markings. The performance becomes less monotonous and more interesting as a result.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Like Maria João Pires, Rubinstein uses a lot of rubato, especially on the highest notes. In his performance, he sustains high notes subtly to create a more dramatic effect. In spite of the short dynamic range in the Agitato, the last section is intense and played with an astonishing force.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>I listened to Nakamura&#8217;s live performance. During the performance there was a lot of use of rubato, moving faster and slower several times within a short period of time. The first ornaments are played very slowly, compared to other performances, and she doesn&#8217;t completely stop at the fermatas. As a whole, I feel like a lot of creative liberties were taken during the performance regarding speed.</p>



<p></p>

<p>This recording by Lisiecki is the one that follows the score more closely. Particularly the stacatto at the end of the main phrase. It was the only performer I listened to who played stacatto and it opened my eyes to a new perspective. Throughout the piece there is very little rubato nor a lot of variation in dynamics, making it less dramatic than other performances.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Foderova&#8217;s performance is very intense. Maybe because it&#8217;s a live performance. A lot of that intensity comes from the rubato and some creative liberties she takes with the score, but mainly from her pauses. She uses dramatic pauses, especially at the end of the Agitato, which lasts for almost six seconds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Every artistic form that requires performers, such as theatre, cinema, dance, or music, always raises the question: how&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Every artistic form that requires performers, such as theatre, cinema, dance, or music, always raises the question: how personal should a performance be? Should the interpretation of written art be faithful to the author&#8217;s intentions? Does it make sense to contextualize old works to the era in which they were performed? Is there a set of rules to follow? If so, does that make a performance authentic? What is authenticity?</p>



<p>There are many questions when it comes to Performance Practice. I won&#8217;t be able to answer all of them, but I&#8217;ll try to answer &#8220;What is Performance Practice?&#8221;, &#8220;What factors should a performer consider when interpreting a score?&#8221; and &#8220;What makes a good performance?&#8221;.</p>



<p>The field of Performance Practice or Historical Informed Practice studies performance (Rile, 2014), specifically how performance was practised in the past. In general, it focuses on works from the 18th century and earlier that have no contemporary recordings. In order to make an informed interpretation of a piece, a performer should take into account that music reflects the culture of the place where it was composed. In addition to its composer&#8217;s personality, it reflects the values of its society at the time the piece was composed and the instruments available.</p>



<p>A successful performance practice involves a number of factors inherent to the music, including sound, physical space, tuning and temperament, articulation, tempo, and dynamics (Duffin, 2017).</p>



<p>Sound, for instance, describes how instruments sounded at the time of composition. Many instruments have changed since then. Some don&#8217;t exist anymore, and others weren&#8217;t invented until the 18th century (such as the piano). Therefore, when choosing instruments to play, the performer must consider the sound the composer intended.</p>



<p>Dynamic and tempo are also examples. It is usually up to the interpreter to decide what those indications in the scores mean. In terms of tempo, metronomes weren&#8217;t invented until the 19th century, so pieces written before that can&#8217;t be gauged concretely. In fact, there is some debate about whether Bach&#8217;s music has been played faster or slower over time (Niles, 2018). Similarly, dynamics are ambiguous. A forte or piano can mean something different to different performers or even to different venues.</p>



<p>A historically informed performance is also influenced by factors that are extrinsic to music. This includes the social and political context, the piece&#8217;s commission, and the venue where it was to be performed. Factors such as these can help determine intrinsic musical characteristics.</p>



<p>In the end, the most influential factor is the personality of the performer, which influences the interpretation of the piece greatly. Without a performer&#8217;s interpretation, all performances of a piece would sound the same. It is my belief that most composers would not wish to remove that human trait from a performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All arts are human by definition. As a result, such arts will always feature interpretation, improvisation, adaptation, contextualization, ambition, and imagination. Ultimately, what makes a&nbsp;good&nbsp;performance, and specifically good performance practice, will come down to the performer&#8217;s&nbsp;good&nbsp;judgment.</p>

<p>Sonata in D Major, TWV 44:1 is a piece of Baroque music composed by the German composer Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767). It combines elements of concerto and suite genres and is composed for trumpet, strings, and basso continuo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three movements make up the piece, each with its own distinctive character. In Sinfonia Spirituoso, the opening trumpet fanfare presents a lively and energetic start. The second movement, Largo, displays two violins in intimate harmony with the basso continuo. With its lively tempo and energetic tone, the closing movement Vivace brings the piece to a triumphant conclusion.</p>



<p>I found it to be a captivating work of Baroque music with an interesting and multifaceted composition. The opening fanfare immediately captivated me with its bold and triumphant sound.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Some claim that the world is gradually becoming united, that it will grow into a brotherly community as distances shrink and ideas are transmitted through the air. Alas, you must not believe that men can be united in this way.</p><cite>Fyodor Dostoevsky,&nbsp;<em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>&nbsp;(1880)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Globalisation is “a term that describes a new era of human communication and interconnection across cultural, national, and geographic boundaries” (Beaster-Jones, 2013). In other words, it refers to a growing relationship between culture, economy, and people, with an emphasis on the economic side. In this text, cosmopolitanism and globalisation must be distinguished. The first one is a socioeconomic force that strives to homogenize consumption. The second is a personal attitude towards embracing diversity and humanizing it (Petriglieri, 2016).</p>



<p>A modern concept of globalisation might have started with the Roman Empire, which interconnected the world (part of it, to be precise), leading to easier mobility (Bora &amp; Bonelli, 2019). Globalisation was made truly global around the 16th century when the relationship between countries such as Portugal, Spain, India and China intensified (Flynn &amp; Giraldez, 2007). As transportation became easier, safer, and faster, cultures, thoughts, and rituals clashed more frequently in various aspects of society in the 17th and 18th centuries. Culture and music were not exceptions, as music is inherently social.</p>



<p>Globalisation during the romantic period was caused by three factors. First of all, the decrease in aristocracy patronage broadened audiences and gave the artist more room for experimentation with novel sounds, techniques, and instruments. Secondly, artists became more virtuosic and self-expressive, leading to a fusion of their cultural roots with traditional and local music, creating new sounds. Bartók and Chopin, for instance, are known for incorporating folk songs from their birth countries into their music. Lastly, the mobility of artists. Artists (and audiences) have become less limited by time and space and were able to interact across many locations. Apart from the increase in world fairs and music festivals that attracted worldwide audiences, music tourism and travel allowed artists to experience new cultures and be inspired by them.</p>



<p>As a result of increased globalisation, artists experimented more and audiences were predisposed to exploring different sounds, new formats, and new instruments. This resulted in even broader experimentation during the modernist era, which influenced modern music in the 20th century. If artists and audiences weren&#8217;t inclined to merge cultures and experiment with new sounds, genres like blues, jazz, rock, K-pop and reggaeton wouldn&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>Even though society and music have made remarkable advances, there are some concerns about globalisation. A major concern is the loss of individuality. Cultural homogenization is a risk associated with globalisation, and there is a fear that the individuality and identity of a group will be lost in an effort to incorporate other cultural settings (Back, 2012). There is also concern about undue cultural appropriation, which is a more recent concern. In the context of globalisation, cultural appropriation is unavoidable. However, a question arises as to how we can use other cultures&#8217; proprieties and what processes are legitimate so that we can increase contact between cultures (Choufan, 2021).</p>



<p>In my opinion, all advances in technology are preparing society for increased globalisation. With the advent of streaming music platforms, social networks, and cheap travel, it&#8217;s more common to see the effects of globalisation, such as multi-country genres (K-Pop) or mixed-background bands (The Foreign Exchange and Superorganism). In the future, globalisation may turn into glocalisation (Roudometof, 2016) in which instead of cultural homogenization, local cultures will adapt global phenomena into their own traditions. This can be seen today, where there is a widening diversity of consumption of Spotify and iTunes in different countries than ever before (Bello &amp; Garcia, 2021).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Wagner took around 26 years to complete the Ring Cycle, which consists of four German-language epic music dramas&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Wagner took around 26 years to complete the Ring Cycle, which consists of four German-language epic music dramas lasting about 16 hours. Although the briefing asked for a 500-word essay, I found it challenging to condense such a monumental cycle to that length. The result was a longer text. I watched Opera North&#8217;s performance of The Ring Cycle.</p>



<p>“The Nibelungen Myth as Sketch for a Drama” was Wagner’s first prose sketch in 1848, which sparked his interest in the project. When Wagner began writing the poem (the libretto) for Siegfried’s Death (which became Götterdämmerung), he noticed that the heroic Siegfried had to be described in much more detail and clarity. By working backwards, he crafted Siegfried’s heroic youth story. Siegfried’s parentage and the family history of the Wälsungs are told in Die Walküre. Additionally, Wagner wanted to show how Alberich (the Nibelung dwarf) forged the ring of power from the Rhinegold. The story had been written from end to beginning, and now the music would be composed from beginning to end. In November 1874, the final score for The Ring was completed (Hoover, n.d.).</p>



<p>In Wagner’s vision, this cycle would be set at a festival and performed over three days and one evening. Historically, Wagner had been fascinated by Greek tragedy for some time, and the concept of this opera was a logical fit with those ideals (Hoover, n.d.).</p>



<p>Wagner considered this to be not just a musical composition, but an experience. He introduced the term ‘gesamtkunstwerk’, which means “total work of art”, in two essays in 1849: Art and Revolution and The Artwork of the Future. His goal was to reunite the most common forms of art – music, drama, poetry, and staging (Krause, 2020).</p>



<p>During the development of this opera, he developed much larger orchestras, invented new instruments (the Wagner Tuba was created by him), and took the staging to an entirely unprecedented level. In all likelihood, he was the one who pushed for the lights to be turned down and the drama played in the dark to ensure a better viewing experience (Huizenga &amp; Daugert, 2008). His obsessive specifications led him to build a radically redesigned theatre in Bayreuth, Germany. In doing so, he forever changed the landscape of musical theatre.</p>



<p>In terms of music, this cycle is notable for its use of leitmotifs (over sixty in total). While leitmotifs existed before Wagner, he used them creatively, altering keys, upside down, mixing them together, and more (Midgette, 2021). His music became a narrator and participant in the action, instead of just acting as an accompanist.</p>



<p>This led to the idea of a talking orchestra (Midgette, 2021). It was Wagner’s desire for the orchestra to function like the chorus of a Greek tragedy, predicting, showing, and commenting on what happens. This required sixty-four stringed instruments, four times as many wind instruments, and more prominence for the brass section than was common at the time.</p>



<p>All this grandiosity led to an enormous challenge for the singers. In addition to the length of the opera, the greatest challenge for the singers was to make themselves heard over such a powerful orchestra. The technical difficulty of singing these operas has given rise to the term Wagnerian voice: a voice that is substantial, dense in tone, extremely powerful, and ideally evenly balanced throughout.</p>



<p>Personally, I was most impressed by the amount of work Wagner put into The Ring Cycle. The more research I do, the more I realize how innovative and impactful his work was for our music. By using the orchestra as a storyteller, the music feels a lot like a soundtrack for a movie, very similar to what contemporary composers compose for movies today. It is clear now why composers like Korngold cite Wagner as an inspiration (Ross, 2020).</p>



<p>The development of the characters was another thing I liked. There is no clear line between good and evil. All characters have strengths and flaws, akin to Game Of Thrones and less to Lord Of The Rings. This makes them more human (even Gods) and complex, and the music reflects this.</p>



<p>On the negative side, I felt overwhelmed. Too much is happening all the time, with too many leitmotifs, plots, and themes. It’s true that the leitmotifs appear again and again during the operas, but there isn’t much sense of repetition that makes the ears rest from the continuous novelty. There is almost an impression that Wagner wanted to show all of his virtuosity in one work and to develop his ideas as much as possible. However, it’s always a good idea to remember that less is more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve been reading the book Dilla Time, about the life of James DeWitt Yancey, better known as J Dilla and Jay Dee. He was an American record producer, drummer, rapper, songwriter, and rapper. It is Dilla&#8217;s &#8220;drunk&#8221;, and &#8220;laid back&#8221; time-feel that makes his work unique and difficult to interpret, define, or translate. His production style has inspired some of the world&#8217;s most renowned pop, hip-hop, and jazz musicians &#8212; achieved, in part, because he didn&#8217;t quantize his music (Fitzpatrick, 2011).</p>



<p>While I don&#8217;t listen to a lot of hip-hop, I was intrigued by his stories and how he blew everyone away with his eccentric rhythms, so I decided to check out some of the music he produced or composed (Stadnicki, 2017). My favourite was Running by The Pharcyde, released in 1995.</p>



<p>It begins with a simple maracas sample from James Moody, followed by acoustic guitar from Luiz Bonfá. As I listen to these samples, I realize that the tempo is not always right. I start to understand why people talk about J Dilla when the drums start playing. It seems like the kick drum is rushing (perhaps running?) while the snare is dragging after the hi-hats. This results in strangely relaxed music, with an endless forward motion.</p>



<p>These kinds of not quantized drum sounds are somehow normal nowadays and explored by a lot of musicians, but I can imagine how refreshing it was to listen to such a relaxed and “humanized” beat after listening to so much on-tempo electronic music from the late ’80s and early ’90s.</p>

<p>“Letter from Home” is a composition by American composer Aaron Copland, written in 1944 and commissioned as a patriotic work by Paul Whiteman for his Radio Hall of Fame Orchestra. The piece is a reflection on the experiences of soldiers returning home from war, and the changes that they have undergone during their time away. The piece is written in the style of a letter from a soldier to his family and conveys the bittersweet emotions of coming home after having seen the horrors of war.</p>



<p>The piece begins with a sombre, reflective melody, as the soldier reflects on his experiences and considers the changes that have taken place in his life since departing. The music slowly builds to a more upbeat, hopeful tone, as the soldier finds comfort in the thought of being reunited with his family and friends. The piece ends with a triumphant, joyous melody, as the soldier celebrates the joy of being home. The instrumentation is sparse and haunting, evoking a sense of loneliness and longing.</p>



<p>Ultimately, “Letter from Home” is a powerful and poignant tribute to the soldiers who have sacrificed so much for their country. Through its emotional intensity and evocative musical language, Copland captures the complex emotions of a soldier returning home.</p>

<p>Keith Jarrett is a celebrated American jazz musician and composer. He has been active since the 1960s and has released several acclaimed albums, such as My Song, which came out in 1978. His music often features a sublime simplicity and directness that has made it a favorite among jazz enthusiasts.</p>



<p>The title track of Keith Jarrett&#8217;s 1978 album, My Song, is a timeless piece featuring the collaborative efforts of the European Quartet. The melody is introduced by a pensive piano movement that is soon joined by Jan Garabek&#8217;s saxophone and Jon Christensen&#8217;s percussion, which uses shakers and cymbals to create a soft and muted backdrop. Over the years, My Song has become a popular standard among jazz musicians, with Pat Metheny being one of its most notable interpreters.</p>

<p>Symphonie Fantastique, one of Hector Berlioz&#8217;s most well-known compositions, was composed in 1830. After winning the Prix de Rome, the composer spent fifteen months in Italy between 1831 and 1832, and this experience is especially evident in Harold in Italy. Berlioz preferred the Abruzzi mountains over the academy&#8217;s environment, concerts, and operas in Rome (Bynog et al., 2021).</p>



<p>After Paganini’s commission of Harold in Italy, Berlioz finished it in 1834, not only recalling his experience in Italy as an inspiration for the programmatic structure of this symphony but also drawing inspiration from Lord Byron’s popular poem Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage. This resulted in Berlioz utilizing descriptive titles for each movement and the corresponding programmatic nature of the music since he was aiming for writing “a musical impression of the archetypal romantic hero” (Clements, 2001):</p>



<ul><li>Harold in the mountains</li><li>Procession of the Pilgrims Singing Their Evening Prayer</li><li>Serenade</li><li>The Orgy of the Brigands</li></ul>



<p>Unifying all these movements is the solo instrument: the viola. In his plan, Berlioz envisaged “a series of orchestral scenes in which the viola would be involved […] like an actual person, retaining the same character throughout”. That character would be “a melancholy dreamer in the&nbsp;style of Byron’s Childe Harold” (Deller, 2019).</p>



<p>The most interesting thing is that, facing a plan like this, a composer would be compelled to write strong, loud and bold viola lines in every movement, making the instrument and the player shine. But Berlioz took another approach. In order to create a character like Harold, he made the viola gentle, shy, and quiet. It is the orchestra that can sometimes be loud, rough, and strong.</p>



<p>I was struck by the instruction to play the viola as softly as possible &#8211; barely audible. This paradoxically draws more attention to the instrument. A very quiet performance requires an effort on the part of the audience to be able to hear it. The viola player, however, needs to be highly skilled, since it is more difficult to play loudly than softly. For the sound intensity to be maintained along the bow&#8217;s full length, the performer&#8217;s stance must be firmly grounded with solid shoulders and right arm stability (Bathurst, 2016).</p>



<p>This piece was written in the aftermath of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic devastation and trauma, when society was deciding whether to be ruled by a charismatic leader of a totalitarian or by a humane, humble and compassionate leader (Bathurst, 2016). As a humanitarian (Klein, 1969), I believe Berlioz used the viola as a symbol of the latter, being subtle and quiet and allowing the orchestra to shine when necessary, rather than being the solo instrument that always takes center stage. Paganini might not have realized this when he read the score, but after hearing it and watching the viola&#8217;s role, he understood.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Beethoven dead there was no one but Berlioz who could bring him back to life; and I who have experienced your divine compositions worthy of a genius such as yours, believe it is my duty to beg you to be willing to accept as a sign of my homage 20,000 francs.</p><cite>Letter from Paganini to Berlioz</cite></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It was while researching Berlioz&#8217;s Harold in Italy that I came across an article by French violist Antoine Tamestit. This article stated, in 2015, when he played Harold with John Eliot for the first time, he told German composer Jörg Widmann how delighted he was with the piece. Therefore, Widmann composed a viola concerto filled with narration, journeys and interactions with multiple orchestral instruments.</p>



<p>Based on this description, I decided to watch Tamestit&#8217;s performance with the Frankfurt Radio Symphony conducted by Andrés Orozco-Estrada.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Widmann: Viola Concerto ∙ hr-Sinfonieorchester ∙ Antoine Tamestit ∙ Andrés Orozco-Estrada" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_5WraTt_l_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>My overall reaction was one of awe and I still don&#8217;t know if I liked it or not. However, I believe that was the purpose of this concerto. In one interview, Tamestit explains that this piece is intended to disorient the listener (Todes, 2021). While I sometimes understood what the composer was saying, other times I felt disoriented and I wondered if it wasn&#8217;t just too much theatrical for show&#8217;s sake.</p>



<p>In the same interview, Tamestit talks about how the instrumentation is unusual. This concerto, for instance, requires the soloist to scream throughout and requires the pianist to hold a whiskey glass.</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t expecting such a theatrical performance with such an emphasis on the viola soloist. But as an homage or follow-up to Berlioz&#8217;s symphony, Widmann seemed to want to keep the viola at the center of this performance.</p>



<p>The viola is the focus of this piece, for me. As it takes the listener through the viola&#8217;s different sounds, blending and clashing with other instruments, and finding its place within the orchestra.</p>



<p>Berlioz&#8217;s symphony and this concerto have many connections, but for me, the biggest one is the instrument&#8217;s representation. In Harold in Italy, the viola embodied Harold, here the instrument symbolized itself. As I realized, Widmann attempted to meta-characterize the viola. And that was a brilliant idea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During this exercise, I struggled a lot, so I did some more research about transposing. I found this video by Mattia Chiappa explaining transposing with the guitar (an instrument I am more familiar with) and explaining the difference between the two steps: writing and reading. As a result, I understand better the process of transposing and was able to do the exercise more efficiently.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>My go-to book behind bars was helpful in researching the instrument order on an orchestral score.</p>



<p>I discovered that orchestral and large ensemble scores group instrumental sections in the following order: woodwinds, brass, percussion, keyboards, and strings.</p>



<p>Additionally, no matter how few staves are present within a score, instrumental staves remain in the same position.</p>



<p>Each instrument should be listed in the following order:</p>



<p>Piccolo</p>



<p>Flute</p>



<p>Oboe</p>



<p>Cor Anglais</p>



<p>Clarinet</p>



<p>Bass Clarinet</p>



<p>Saxophones</p>



<p>Bassoon</p>



<p>Contrabassoon</p>



<p>Horns</p>



<p>Trumpets</p>



<p>Trombones</p>



<p>Tuba</p>



<p>Timpani</p>



<p>Percussion</p>



<p>Harp and plucked stringed instruments</p>



<p>Keyboard instruments</p>



<p>Soloists or Choir</p>



<p>Violin I</p>



<p>Violin II</p>



<p>Viola</p>



<p>Cello</p>



<p>Contrabass</p>



<p></p>



<p>In terms of translating instruments, these are the most common languages:</p>
