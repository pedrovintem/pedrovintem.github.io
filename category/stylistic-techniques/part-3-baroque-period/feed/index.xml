<p>The feedback from my tutor was generally positive, with a focus on cautioning against pushing the harmonic rules too far. The tutor also emphasized the importance of understanding the use of dissonances and suggested exploring the incorporation of mordents to introduce more character into the piece, instead of the abundance of trills.</p>



<p>Taking these comments into consideration, I proceeded to revise both the score and my own reflections. In terms of the score, I aimed to simplify it, recognizing that certain passages appeared overcrowded and could benefit from enhanced clarity. Specifically, I addressed the conclusion by removing a trill that contained a leap to the final G note. However, I retained an ornament in the last bar, which I believe now presents a more elegant and Bach-inspired style.</p>



<p>Other alterations:</p>



<p>In bars 1 and 2, instead of having a descending sequence, I repeated the notes of the Right Hand in each chord to establish better the harmony.</p>



<p>In bar 6 I changed the G octave to a F octave in the violin to fit the Bb chord beneath.</p>



<p>In bar 7, I changed the Right Hand to start the arpeggio in an E flat instead of G, to create a descending sequence from the previous bars.</p>



<p>In bars 10 and 11 I changed the Right Hand line to become more smooth.</p>



<p>In bars 15-16 and bar 23-24 I replaced the long and unresolved note with a resolution.</p>



<p>In bar 20 and bar 30 I replaced the trill with a mordent.</p>



<p></p>

		<span>Revised reflection</span>

</h2>



<p>I approached this assignment by first thinking about the piece&#8217;s structure, drawing inspiration from Bach&#8217;s violin sonata. I researched various baroque dances, such as the Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, and Gigue, and decided to use the Allemande as a primary inspiration because of its 4/4 meter and binary form. After going through the chords several times, I decided to make my piece in binary form as well: the first section from bar 1 to bar 16 and the second from bar 17 to bar 33.</p>



<p>I chose the first section to be 16 bars long, as this is a common length for the first section of dances like Allemande and Bach&#8217;s sonata. Additionally, the perfect cadence from bar 15 (C major) to bar 16 (F major) and the transition from F major to Bb major in bar 17 made it a logical choice. The presence of rehearsal letters also hinted that there would be a break in this section.</p>



<p>As soon as I determined the structure of my composition, <a href="./../../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" target="_blank">I reviewed my previous analysis of Bach&#8217;s violin sonata to better understand his techniques</a>. </p>



<p>My composition plan was to introduce the main theme of the sonata in the first bars and then explore it with repetitions and variations until the end of the A section. The B section would start with a similar theme, but with some slight changes to keep it fresh and then move to the main theme until the end of the piece.</p>



<p>One of the challenges I faced right at the beginning of the composition was finding the right rhythms and notes. I tried several combinations and ideas but I ended up feeling that they didn&#8217;t match the Baroque style I was aiming for. Either sounded too simple or too uninteresting. My solution was to borrow material from my previous exercise, which was based on Bach&#8217;s Sonata for Viola da Gamba &amp; Harpsichord in G Minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="676" height="242" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1165" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png 676w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-300x107.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-640x229.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Exercise 3.4 theme</figcaption></figure>



<p>But even after finding a theme, I wasn&#8217;t satisfied with how it sounded in the first four bars, so I decided to begin it at rehearsal mark A (bar 5) and develop it from there. Overall, I was pleased with how the melody turned out and specifically enjoyed applying the lessons I learned from Bach by allowing the C# in bar 8 to move to bar 9 instead of resolving to D.</p>



<p>There was a challenge with the first 4 bars since I lacked ideas as to what to do in order to make them interesting. My solution was to write an introduction that hinted at the main theme&#8217;s rhythm, as a preview of what was to come. Despite not being able to find out whether an introduction was common to the Baroque style, I decided to include it since it made sense in this composition.</p>



<p>My goal in the B section was to make the violin sound freer, but not totally different from the previous section. In order to achieve this, I kept the tied note and the three descending notes from the main theme.</p>



<p>The next step was ornamenting the violin and the treble harpsichord. I looked into Taylor (1998), Apel (1969) and Bach (1949) for guidance and kept in mind that Bach used ornaments that were perfectly in time. The main difficulty I faced was understanding how to write the first and final notes on the trills regarding the previous and the next note. For example, in bars 2 and 12, the previous note is the same upper note of the trill. Should the player play it two times or make it tied? I couldn&#8217;t find a definitive answer but it made sense to me to be tied.</p>

<p>In bars 29 and 30, I decided to incorporate a suspiran, which is a technique I learned from an article by Peter Williams (1979).</p>

<p>Overall, I am pleased with how I was able to incorporate elements from Bach&#8217;s sonata into my composition, but I am aware that it may not sound as authentically Baroque as it could. Sometimes it sounds too contemporary. Possibly the pivotal question is this: How can we write in the style of a specific era if we have been influenced by later ones? This may be a constant challenge that composers face, and it&#8217;s something that I kept in mind throughout the composition process. Despite this, I am happy with the final result and how it captures the essence of the Baroque style while incorporating my own creative choices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I approached this assignment by first thinking about the piece&#8217;s structure, drawing inspiration from Bach&#8217;s violin sonata. I researched various baroque dances, such as the Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, and Gigue, and decided to use the Allemande as a primary inspiration because of its 4/4 meter and binary form. After going through the chords several times, I decided to make my piece in binary form as well: the first section from bar 1 to bar 16 and the second from bar 17 to bar 33.</p>



<p>I chose the first section to be 16 bars long, as this is a common length for the first section of dances like Allemande and Bach&#8217;s sonata. Additionally, the perfect cadence from bar 15 (C major) to bar 16 (F major) and the transition from F major to Bb major in bar 17 made it a logical choice. The presence of rehearsal letters also hinted that there would be a break in this section.</p>



<p>As soon as I determined the structure of my composition, <a href="./../../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" target="_blank">I reviewed my previous analysis of Bach&#8217;s violin sonata to better understand his techniques</a>. </p>



<p>My composition plan was to introduce the main theme of the sonata in the first bars and then explore it with repetitions and variations until the end of the A section. The B section would start with a similar theme, but with some slight changes to keep it fresh and then move to the main theme until the end of the piece.</p>



<p>One of the challenges I faced right at the beginning of the composition was finding the right rhythms and notes. I tried several combinations and ideas but I ended up feeling that they didn&#8217;t match the Baroque style I was aiming for. Either sounded too simple or too uninteresting. My solution was to borrow material from my previous exercise, which was based on Bach&#8217;s Sonata for Viola da Gamba &amp; Harpsichord in G Minor.</p>

<p>The next step was ornamenting the violin and the treble harpsichord. I looked into Taylor (1998), Apel (1969) and Bach (1949) for guidance and kept in mind that Bach used ornamentations at the perfect timing. The main difficulty I faced was understanding how to write the first and final notes on the trills regarding the previous and the next note.

<p>In bars 29 and 30, I decided to incorporate a suspiran, which is a technique I learned from an article by Peter Williams (1979).</p>

<p>Overall, I am pleased with how I was able to incorporate elements from Bach&#8217;s sonata into my composition, but I am aware that it may not sound as authentically Baroque as it could. Sometimes it sounds too contemporary. Possibly the pivotal question is this: How can we write in the style of a specific era if we have been influenced by later ones? This may be a constant challenge that composers face, and it&#8217;s something that I kept in mind throughout the composition process. Despite this, I am happy with the final result and how it captures the essence of the Baroque style while incorporating my own creative choices.</p>

<p>Vivaldi Recomposed, composed by the British composer Max Richter and performed by the Konzerthaus Kammerorchester Berlin, is a reinterpretation of Antonio Vivaldi&#8217;s iconic Four Seasons. Richter, known for his unique blend of classical and contemporary music, masterfully weaves themes and ideas from the original composition and adds his modern touch to create a fresh and exciting listening experience.</p>



<p>When I first heard about Vivaldi Recomposed, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder why a composer would take on such a bold and daring task. After all, the Four Seasons is considered a masterpiece, so why would anyone want to tamper with it? But Richter&#8217;s response to this question was simple and illuminating: &#8220;It&#8217;s just everywhere. In a way, we stop being able to hear it.&#8221; (Service, 2017). And with that, it all made sense. The Four Seasons has become so ubiquitous that it has become background noise. I prefer to look at this work as a wake-up call or a provocation to think about something you take for granted.</p>



<p>After listening to it more than once, a few elements caught my attention. First and foremost, Richter&#8217;s work is not an arrangement of the original piece, but an entirely reimagined interpretation based on Vivaldi&#8217;s core. This became clear to me when my 5-year-old daughter began whistling like a bird when I listened to the Spring movement. Richter effectively conveyed the birds singing as Vivaldi intended, but in a creative and innovative way.</p>



<p>Another aspect that caught my attention was the simplicity and repetition of the movements. I don&#8217;t see it as superior or inferior to Vivaldi&#8217;s original, but a reflection of modern aesthetics valuing repetition over baroque flamboyance, and Richter&#8217;s style emphasizing prolonged notes played over repetitive themes (e.g. Infra 8).</p>



<p>Additionally, the use of synthesizers in the piece was particularly interesting to me, as they were used not to over-modernize the soundscape, but rather as a hint of modernity that amplified the range of sounds and added depth to the strings.</p>



<p>I can rephrase the initial &#8220;Why?&#8221; to &#8220;Should?&#8221; I believe the answer is yes, composers like Richter should continue creating recomposed works, <a href="./../../../../listening-to-boris-blacher-variations-on-a-theme-of-paganini/index.html" data-type="post" data-id="135" target="_blank">as I previously observed</a>.</p>



<p>I believe music is a living and organic force, not a static one. The reason for this is that musical instruments evolved, tuning evolved, and players evolved. Therefore, the way we hear these compositions today doesn&#8217;t sound the way they did when previous composers such as Vivaldi composed them. By reimagining these works, we not only pay tribute to the greats of the past but also ensure that music lives on for generations to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Reading &#8220;How to Listen to Great Music&#8221; by Robert Greenberg has been an invaluable resource in learning how to listen to and analyze music. The author suggests listening to Bach&#8217;s Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 as a way to gain a deeper understanding of Baroque concertos, with a particular emphasis on the ritornello. The concerto, which is composed for flute, solo violin, harpsichord, and strings, presents several interesting features upon listening and studying the score.</p>



<p>Right from the start of the concerto, I noticed the ritornello theme, which was highlighted by Greenberg, and how it reappears in fragments throughout the movement before being repeated in the end after the harpsichord solo.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="547" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-1024x547.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1209" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-1024x547.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-300x160.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-768x410.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-640x342.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-960x513.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29.png 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ritornello Theme</figcaption></figure>



<p>As Greenberg explains in his book, the function of the ritornello theme is to create a sense of logical inevitability, providing a feeling of returning home and familiarity, even if only for a brief moment. This helps the listener relax and not be overwhelmed by constant new sounds.</p>



<p>It works similarly to a chorus in modern-day popular music. but it typically appears at the beginning and end of the movement, while choruses in contemporary music typically appear in the middle and end of songs. I am curious as to why composers have shifted the placement of this familiar theme from the beginning to the middle of their compositions.</p>



<p>This movement also stands out for its unique use of the harpsichord as a solo instrument. While it was often used as a continuo instrument in the past, Bach elevated its role to that of a true solo instrument, giving it equal importance alongside the flute and violin. According to Greenberg, this concerto marks a significant moment in music history as the harpsichord&#8217;s solo capabilities were truly showcased for the first time. </p>



<p>The second movement of the concerto is an affettuoso, characterized by its melodic singing between the flute and violin. As I listened, I noticed two features that I had previously encountered in Bach&#8217;s violin sonata &#8211; the use of long, melodic lines that persistently avoid resolving to a steady cadence (as exemplified by the flute&#8217;s quick movement to C), and the repetition of a rhythmic pattern (in this case, quaver-quaver-dotted semiquaver-demisemiquaver) throughout the entire movement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.20.07.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1210" width="445" height="304" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.20.07.png 738w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.20.07-300x205.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.20.07-640x437.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" /></figure>



<p>The third movement starts with the exposition of a fugal theme by the violin, which is then repeated by the flute. However, as the movement progresses, the violin and flute often play in unison, rather than in counterpoint as is typical in a true fugue. Despite this, there is a significant use of polyphonic texture throughout the movement.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="Glenn Gould &amp; Yehudi Menuhin - Bach, Sonata No. 4 in C minor (OFFICIAL)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Boii0EA6hWo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>This sonata looks like a good example of Baroque music, characterized by its long melodic lines and ornamental elements. Upon listening to it for the first time played by Glenn Gould and Yehudi Menuhin, I feel that there&#8217;s an interesting contrast between the smoothness of the violin and the pointed, moving accompaniment of the harpsichord. After listening to it several times and studying the score, I noticed several unique features.</p>



<p>One of the key observations I made was that the harpsichord had a repetitive pattern, which allowed the violin to take centre stage. The bass harpsichord usually played a continuous arpeggio starting on the downbeat, while the treble harpsichord had an upward and downward motion with its highest note on the second note of the violin rhythm. The violin melody, in section A, seemed to be a long single melody that lasted 16 bars. Although I could definitely hear that the melody line didn&#8217;t settle until bar 16 and it seemed like Bach avoided a cadence in bars 8 and 12, I was unsure of how he achieved this effect. But my tutor helped clarify that it was a mixture of harmony, not having a perfect cadence, melody/rhythm notes that cross bars, and the use of weaker inversions of chords that gave a feeling of movement instead of a final rest. I hadn&#8217;t thought about how inverting chords could transmit a sense movement and it made much more sense to me after his answer.</p>



<p>Another observation I made was the rhythm of the violin melody and its repetition. This movement of the sonata is a Siciliano which is a musical style from the baroque era, usually in a slow 6/8 time and in a minor key. The violin follows the traditional Siciliana rhythms with a dotted quaver &#8211; semiquaver &#8211; quaver. It&#8217;s interesting to notice that Bach uses this exact rhythm 36 times and some of its variations throughout this movement but without making it feel repetitive. The use of ornamentation is essential here.</p>

<p>Overall, I find this piece to be deceptively simple yet incredibly evocative and emotionally charged. Reflecting on its various features has helped me gain a deeper understanding of how to approach my assignment with greater insight and understanding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The exercise proved to be more challenging than anticipated. I began by creating the chords as outlined in the instructions, which was enjoyable and entertaining. It took some time to figure out the different melodic lines and determine whether, for example, the bass should move upward or downward from bar 1 to bar 2. Ultimately, I ended up with more dynamic lines in the Tenor and Bass compared to the Soprano and Alto, which appeared to be a bit static.</p>



<p>The most challenging aspect for me was developing the melodic lines. I found that the Tenor and Bass lines were easier to work with and changing them added an interesting rhythm to the phrase. In beat 3 of bar 1, I added a passing note to the Tenor to shorten the leap. In bar 3, I continued to add quavers to the Tenor and Bass to maintain a similar rhythm as the first part.</p>



<p>Upon examining Bach‚Äôs harmonization, I noticed that the main difference was that he added much more interest to bar 4, particularly with the descending Tenor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During my research, I discovered that Bach is well-known for his prolific composition of cantatas, both secular and sacred. He developed the &#8220;chorale cantata&#8221; style and at his most productive, he composed one cantata per week for eight years. Between 1723 and 1729, Bach completed four yearly cycles consisting of about 60 cantatas each (Greer, 2002).</p>



<p>&#8220;Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140&#8221; is one of his most famous cantatas which relates the story from Matthew 25:1-13, about the ten virgins waiting for the arrival of the bridegroom (Christ).</p>



<p>This Cantata follows a symmetrical structure where it includes a chorale in the middle movement and is framed by two sets of recitative-aria movements. The cantata begins and ends with chorale-choruses, which I found to be a common feature in Bach‚Äôs compositions.</p>



<p>After listening to the cantata three times (without the score, with the score and after my research), I found it to be a dramatic and theatrical piece, but even more impressive when I learned about the context in which it was performed in a church setting.</p>



<p>For example, in the first movement, the ritornello in the first 4 bars reminded me of a wedding and it was only after my research that I found out that the setting of this movement is the calling of all Jerusalem to prepare for a wedding feast. Another example of dramatism is how the voices of this first movement don‚Äôt start singing together, but arrive one by one, as if they are arriving at the event.</p>

<p>The uplifting feeling in the first movement comes from the serene instrumentation combined with the uplifting lines of the chorale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="256" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-1024x256.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1161" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-1024x256.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-300x75.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-768x192.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-1536x383.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-2048x511.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-640x160.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-960x240.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00.png 2228w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I found the second movement to be like a narrator, with the Tenor voice, moving the story forward. The third movement is a dialogue between the Soul (Soprano) and Jesus (Bass) and in the fourth movement, I found the conjunction of a simple melody line of the tenor with a danceable string melody supported by the continuous movement of the continuo very pleasing. </p>



<p>The seventh movement, the last choral part, is a hymn so that all the congregation can join and sing in a final movement. That&#8217;s why the soprano sings the melody and the other voices fill in the harmony.</p>



<p>I found listening to Cantata No. 140 by Bach enjoyable, but it was more enriching to understand the meaning and context of the composition. At first, I didn&#8217;t fully grasp the nuances and constructions Bach made, but by learning more about cantatas and their role in bringing people together in a church setting, I was able to appreciate it more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The exercise proved to be more complex and time-consuming than anticipated. I began by creating the bass line, using a continuous quaver pattern like Bach does in the sonata I was studying. However, I decided to make the line ascend and descend in all bars except for bar 3. Then, I moved on to the treble line where I attempted to imitate Bach&#8217;s repetitive style but found it lacking interest. To add some variety, I incorporated some rhythm borrowed from Bach&#8217;s Sonata for Viola da Gamba &amp; Harpsichord in G Minor. Finally, I wrote the melody, which proved to be challenging due to the prominent harpsichord treble line. I found myself questioning if that&#8217;s why Bach kept it repetitive. Despite this, I completed the violin melody, complementing the harpsichord.</p>



<p>In regards to cadence, I tried to leave it unresolved, similar to Bach in his sonata but found that the unresolved cadence is more prominent in the harpsichord line than the violin.</p>



<p>In the end, I was not entirely satisfied with the violin melody. I believe it needs to be made more distinct and not so closely tied to the harpsichord.</p>



<p></p>

<p>After closely analyzing Bach&#8217;s piece, I gained a deeper understanding of the movement of chords, particularly the bass line. I observed how skillfully he transitioned from the C minor scale to the G major. This prompted me to redo the exercise, attempting to replicate Bach&#8217;s approach on the harpsichord more closely.</p>



<p>To my surprise, the exercise seemed simpler this time around. Whether it was due to having done it previously or my increasing knowledge of Bach&#8217;s writing, I am not sure. I transferred my original harpsichord treble line to the violin and wrote the harpsichord lines afterwards.</p>



<p>Overall, I was quite pleased with the outcome of my second attempt. The piece appeared more cohesive, with the violin melody standing out without constant competition from the other lines.</p>

<p>Although I appreciate pop music, I&#8217;m usually turned away from songs that are too popular on the charts. But, when I stumbled upon SZA&#8217;s &#8220;Kill Bill&#8221; on the radio without knowing what it was, I was extremely surprised. The song really caught my attention. My impression was that the song never settled down, a feeling (a very good feeling) I also had when <a href="./../../../../listening-to-beach-boys-god-only-knows/index.html" data-type="post" data-id="531" target="_blank">listening to God Only Knows</a>.</p>



<p>The aspect that impressed me the most was the chorus vocal melody. It was straightforward yet stunning and flowed smoothly. Upon transcribing it, I discovered the song was in Ab Major, but the vocal melody only utilized the Ab once on the last note of the 4th beat, which was a rather weak one. There was also an A flat, a chromatic note just a half-step from the tonic, leading to a sense of uncertainty and incompletion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="74" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1024x74.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1222" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1024x74.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-300x22.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-768x55.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1536x111.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-2048x148.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-640x46.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-960x69.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26.png 2578w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The chord progression also caught my attention. Throughout the song, it used the same progression: Bbm-Eb-Ab-F or ii-V-I-VI. This again contributed to a sense of instability as it started on ii and placed the I on the third bar, which is a weaker position for establishing the key. The final chord was a modulation to a chromatic chord of F Major, which was my favourite part of the chorus. It was playful, and daring, and complemented the lyrics perfectly (e.g. &#8220;Rather be in jail than alone&#8221;).</p>



<p>But right from the beginning, the song starts off sounding vague. There&#8217;s a distinct out-of-tune waver that is completely undefined. From that point, the song could head in any direction. Then, the drum beat enters and as with any typical pop song, you anticipate listening to a four-beat loop until the vocals begin. But the vocals come in on the fourth beat, like an anacrusis, unexpectedly.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I don&#8217;t think &#8220;Kill Bill&#8221; will be regarded as a masterpiece like &#8220;God Only Knows,&#8221; but in today&#8217;s landscape of overwhelming similar-sounding pop music, I found the song to be invigorating. I hope it serves as inspiration for other artists to create pop music that departs from standard harmonic and melodic structures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ornamentation was one of the prominent features of the Baroque era and can be loosely described as the practice of embellishing music by adding extra notes and little figures in a very specific style.</p>



<p>Although there is evidence that the ornamentation of melodies goes back to early singers of Gregorian chant, it wasn&#8217;t until the late Renaissance and early Baroque that the ornamentation became codified. It was in France, that the practice of ornamentation in music was standardized under the name &#8220;agr√©ments,&#8221; allowing for the use of signs or abbreviations to indicate them in a score (Apel, 1969).</p>



<p>In order to understand why ornamentation in music was so prominent in the Baroque era, especially the late Baroque, I turned to the article &#8220;Late Baroque Ornamentation: Philosophy and Guideline&#8221; by David Lasocki in which the author details six purposes for the extensive use of these decorative elements during this period.</p>



<p>First, according to the author, it was an essential component of the Baroque aesthetic, emphasising the ornate and decorative. Second, it gave the performer &#8220;an opportunity to demonstrate their judgement, inventiveness, and insight&#8221;. Third, performers had more training and desire to play more than the music exactly as written. Fourth, ornamentation added verve and freshness to the performance through spontaneous recomposition. Fifth, ornamentation helped to create variety in multiple performances of the same work. Finally, it was expected by both performers and audiences, since performers would likely have attempted to use ornamentation in order to please their colleagues and audiences (Lasocki, 1988).</p>



<p>According to Robert Donington in The Interpretation of Early Music, there were more than one hundred and twenty-five signs used in early music, but Victor Rangel-Ribeiro claims that only four were used enough &#8220;to have become characteristic of Baroque music&#8221; (Rangel-Ribeiro, 2016): the appoggiatura (a dissonant note resolving on the weaker beat to the next note above or below), the trill (rapid alternation of the main note with a higher auxiliary note), the mordent (a rapid alternation of the main note with the note immediately below it), and the turn (a decorative flourish consisting of a rapid alternation of the main note with the note above it).</p>



<p>One of the challenges in interpreting Baroque ornamentation is that there was a degree of flexibility and subjectivity in how these ornaments were performed. While composers often provided indications for the use of ornamentation in their scores, they did not always specify exactly how the ornaments should be performed. This left room for interpretation and allowed performers to add their own personal flair and expression to the music.</p>



<p>Composers used various signs to indicate different ornaments, but there was no standardized set of ornamentation symbols. To help clarify which sign was being used for which ornament, some composers included tables of ornaments in their publications starting in the late seventeenth century (Schulenberg, 2001). One of the examples is Bach&#8217;s:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="289" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1130" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png 750w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-300x116.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-640x247.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bach, J.S. and Wolff, C. (2022) <em>Notebook for Wilhelm Friedemann Bach 1720 (Edition Peters) (German Edition)</em>. Alfred Music.</figcaption></figure>



<p>During the period between 1650 and 1750, the practice of writing ornaments as notes in music was considered detrimental to the clarity of the melodic line. J.S. Bach, in particular, was criticized for writing down the ornaments and embellishments that performers were expected to add instinctively. &#8220;He writes down in actual notes the ornaments and embellishments that performers are accustomed to supply instinctively, a habit which not only sacrifices the harmonic beauty of his music but also makes the melody totally indistinct&#8221; (Apel, 1969).</p>



<p>Overall, ornamentation was a central aspect of Baroque music, both in terms of its aesthetic and its performance practice. It was used to add interest, variety, and drama to the music, and was an important part of the composer-performer partnership of the time.</p>

<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been enjoying it more and more the cello. Actually, I think  I&#8217;m particularly drawn to low-pitched instruments like the acoustic bass, bassoon, and cello. When I learned that Schubert wrote a piece for a string quintet with a second cello instead of the usual second viola, I was curious to listen to it.</p>



<p>Listening to it was an emotional journey. The piece seemed to effortlessly shift from one mood to another. For instance, in the first movement (10:03-13:05), it transitioned from a beautiful melodic line to an intense, almost violent cello and back to the melodic line and again back to an angry mood. All this in just 3 minutes.</p>



<p>Sometimes the piece reminded me of Beethoven. For example, at the beginning of the third movement (00:00-04:03), where there is such a strength that it almost looks like an entire orchestra is playing. I think sometimes I could hear a brass instrument within the strings, and it&#8217;s amazing how Schubert was able to create such magic.</p>



<p>I think the decision to use two cellos gave the piece a full orchestral sound, especially during moments with a darker mood, such as the first movement.</p>



<p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this piece and it has sparked my interest in exploring Schubert&#8217;s other works.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As I worked through the exercises, I found that realizing figured bass was more challenging than I initially expected. While I had an understanding of harmony and chord structure, applying this knowledge to the figured bass notation required me to think more critically and pay attention to the specific intervals and chord qualities indicated by the figures.</p>



<p>Despite the initial difficulty, I found that the process of realizing figured bass became easier and more intuitive as I continued to work through the exercises. I enjoyed the process of analyzing the figures and determining the appropriate chords to use in each situation.</p>



<p>One aspect of figured bass that I found particularly appealing was the way it allows for a balance between structure and creativity. As with the counterpoint rules we studied before, there are certain conventions to follow, but there is still room to make choices. While the basic harmonic structure is provided by the figured bass symbols, the performer is given the freedom to interpret and realize those chords in a way that fits the musical context and their own artistic vision.</p>



<p>Overall, I found the process of realizing figured bass to be both challenging and rewarding. While it may not be a technique that I would use in my own music-making (does any composer use it today? I couldn&#8217;t find an answer), I can see how it could be a useful tool for composers and players in order to keep everyone on the same register. Additionally, I believe that the process of realizing figured bass has helped me to deepen my understanding of harmony and chord structure, which will undoubtedly be beneficial in my future musical endeavours.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There are many different ways in which instruments can be tuned, and the method used has varied throughout&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are many different ways in which instruments can be tuned, and the method used has varied throughout history and across different cultures. In Western classical music, the most commonly used tuning system is equal temperament (more specifically the 12-tone equal temperament), in which each note is separated from the next by a fixed interval known as a semitone. This system allows for the easy transposition of music and the ability to play in any key, but can sometimes result in less pure-sounding intervals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-1120" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38.jpeg 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-300x225.jpeg 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-768x576.jpeg 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-640x480.jpeg 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-960x720.jpeg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Before the widespread use of equal temperament, other tuning systems were commonly employed. Pythagoras, in the 6th century BC, developed a tuning system based on perfect fifths with a 3:2 ratio. This system, known as Pythagorean tuning, is a form of Just Intonation that preserves the pure sound of fifths but has the drawback of producing out-of-tune thirds, which were not commonly used before the Renaissance. To address this issue, just temperament was developed.</p>



<p>During the Renaissance, the Meantone system of tuning was developed as musicians searched for new ways to experiment with tonality and harmony. It differed from the Pythagorean system in that it focused on the major third rather than the root and fifth, enabling the creation of more harmonious melodies by making dissonant notes more in tune. This system also introduced its own dissonances, known as wolf intervals.</p>



<p>In the Meantone temperament, the octave can be divided into more than 12 pitches, producing distinct pitches for notes like G‚ôØ and A‚ô≠. Some keyboard instruments were designed to accommodate these additional pitches.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>During the Baroque era, &#8220;well-tempered&#8221; systems became popular. These tuning systems slightly adjust the intervals between the pitches of an instrument to optimize its performance in a specific key or range of keys. The tunings of the notes are not perfectly aligned with a particular scale, like equal temperament, but rather are adjusted to produce more pleasant melodies and harmonies in a particular key or set of keys. This allows for greater flexibility and expressiveness in music, as different keys can have their own unique tonal characteristics.</p>



<p>In the early 20th century, Czech composer Alois H√°ba introduced microtonal music, a new tuning system featuring intervals smaller than a semitone. This system allows for more complex and interesting harmonies, but requires specialized instruments and can be challenging for musicians trained in equal temperament to play.</p>



<p>This is just a brief overview of Western tuning systems. In other parts of the world, other systems have been used. For instance, Indian classical music frequently employs just intonation, with the addition of shruti, intervals smaller than those normally found between notes, similar to cents in Western music (<em>Microtones in Indian Classical Music</em>, no date). In the modern Arab tone system, the octave is divided into 24 equal intervals known as quarter tones. The specific notes used in a piece belong to one of more than seventy modes or maqam rows.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This turned out harder than I thought. The process of writing the numbers of the figured bass is slower than realising the figured bass. After checking against the solution, I realised I made several mistakes as shown below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="254" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-1024x254.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1104" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-1024x254.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-300x74.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-768x191.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-1536x381.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-2048x508.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-640x159.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-960x238.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">First attempt</figcaption></figure>



<p>I forgot the F# in the first bar and missed the 4+. Strangely, bar 3 has the same first chord, but I added a # to it. Clearly, there was a lack of attention.</p>



<p>That first chord in bar 3 is a 7th chord, so the 4+ should replace the lonely #.</p>



<p>Likewise, I forgot to add the b to the Ab chord. As well as the chords in bar 4 where I did not add the accidentals.</p>



<p>There is only one question I have left. The solution did not contain figured bass in the second note in bar 3. How much should be written?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This exercise was fun because it allowed me to experiment with different chord voicings and try to incorporate some voice-leading and melodic shapes. As I experimented with different spacings, I noticed that closer chords sounded muddier, whereas spread chords were much sharper and more detailed. I used these spread chords to add punctuation to certain parts of the composition, such as in bar 6.</p>

<p>I recently became a fan of Caroline Shaw after listening to her Partita for 8 Singer. I have since listened to some of her other songs, including &#8220;To the Sky,&#8221; which features Shaw&#8217;s exceptional vocals and the talented musicianship of the exploratory New York ensemble S≈ç Percussion. The lyrics for the song are taken from Anne Steele&#8217;s 18th-century hymnal, the Sacred Harp.</p>



<p>The song starts off with a gentle hum and softly rumbling marimba, gradually increasing in intensity and culminating in Shaw&#8217;s powerful vocals. Shaw&#8217;s music often showcases a dynamic range and the versatility of the voice as an instrument.</p>



<p>In addition to Shaw&#8217;s vocals, S≈ç Percussion&#8217;s expert use of percussion instruments creates a rich and complex soundscape that perfectly complements Shaw&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>After a gentle start, the song builds to a climax with exuberance and then fades away, leaving me with a sense of awe and wonder.</p>



<p>Overall, &#8220;To the Sky&#8221; is a beautiful and moving piece of music that has left me wanting to hear more from Shaw.</p>

<p>Because of Project 3.0, I started listening to H√§ndel&#8217;s Dixit Dominus&#8217; first movement and ended up listening to the entire work. </p>



<p>Georg Friedrich H√§ndel was a German-born composer (1685 &#8211; 1759) who worked in Germany, and Italy and settled in London. He was heavily influenced by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition and the Italian Baroque style. H√§ndel&#8217;s music is considered a pinnacle of the &#8220;high baroque&#8221; style and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of his era.</p>



<p>Dixit Dominus is a psalm setting completed in 1707 and is scored for an SSATB choir and soloists, strings and continuo. </p>



<p>Although I enjoyed the entire piece, I found the first movement to be the most interesting and surprising. As a psalm, I was expecting a contemplative and loving sound. Instead, I found it to be rough and even a bit hostile. This was due to the rhythmic vitality which felt a lot like a warlike snare.</p>



<p>It is not surprising that the piece&#8217;s opening movement evokes a warlike sound, given the psalm&#8217;s theme about God giving the king of Israel the power to defeat his enemies (Cl√°ssicos dos Cl√°ssicos, 2019).</p>



<p>The ending of Dominus a dextris tuis is another example of the power of the choir, as it resembles a war chant. I imagine this would likely have been striking to an audience in the 1700s, given the religious context in which it was performed.</p>



<p>The choir in this piece reminded me of Caroline Shaw&#8217;s Partita for 8 Voices. I believe that they are similar in their exploration of different vocal timbers and ranges, either together or in counterpoint. Additionally, the staccato rhythm of the voices in both pieces creates an almost drum-like feeling.</p>
