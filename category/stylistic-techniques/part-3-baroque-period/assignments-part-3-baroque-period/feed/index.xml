										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I approached this assignment by first thinking about the piece&#8217;s structure, drawing inspiration from Bach&#8217;s violin sonata. I researched various baroque dances, such as the Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, and Gigue, and decided to use the Allemande as a primary inspiration because of its 4/4 meter and binary form. After going through the chords several times, I decided to make my piece in binary form as well: the first section from bar 1 to bar 16 and the second from bar 17 to bar 33.</p>



<p>I chose the first section to be 16 bars long, as this is a common length for the first section of dances like Allemande and Bach&#8217;s sonata. Additionally, the perfect cadence from bar 15 (C major) to bar 16 (F major) and the transition from F major to Bb major in bar 17 made it a logical choice. The presence of rehearsal letters also hinted that there would be a break in this section.</p>



<p>As soon as I determined the structure of my composition, <a href="./../../../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" target="_blank">I reviewed my previous analysis of Bach&#8217;s violin sonata to better understand his techniques</a>. </p>



<p>My composition plan was to introduce the main theme of the sonata in the first bars and then explore it with repetitions and variations until the end of the A section. The B section would start with a similar theme, but with some slight changes to keep it fresh and then move to the main theme until the end of the piece.</p>



<p>One of the challenges I faced right at the beginning of the composition was finding the right rhythms and notes. I tried several combinations and ideas but I ended up feeling that they didn&#8217;t match the Baroque style I was aiming for. Either sounded too simple or too uninteresting. My solution was to borrow material from my previous exercise, which was based on Bach&#8217;s Sonata for Viola da Gamba &amp; Harpsichord in G Minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="676" height="242" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1165" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png 676w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-300x107.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-640x229.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Exercise 3.4 theme</figcaption></figure>



<p>But even after finding a theme, I wasn&#8217;t satisfied with how it sounded in the first four bars, so I decided to begin it at rehearsal mark A (bar 5) and develop it from there. Overall, I was pleased with how the melody turned out and specifically enjoyed applying the lessons I learned from Bach by allowing the C# in bar 8 to move to bar 9 instead of resolving to D.</p>



<p>There was a challenge with the first 4 bars since I lacked ideas as to what to do in order to make them interesting. My solution was to write an introduction that hinted at the main theme&#8217;s rhythm, as a preview of what was to come. Despite not being able to find out whether an introduction was common to the Baroque style, I decided to include it since it made sense in this composition.</p>



<p>My goal in the B section was to make the violin sound freer, but not totally different from the previous section. In order to achieve this, I kept the tied note and the three descending notes from the main theme.</p>



<p>The next step was ornamenting the violin and the treble harpsichord. I looked into Taylor (1998), Apel (1969) and Bach (1949) for guidance and kept in mind that Bach used ornamentations at the perfect timing. The main difficulty I faced was understanding how to write the first and final notes on the trills regarding the previous and the next note. For example, in bars 2 and 12, the previous note is the same upper note of the trill. Should the player play it two times or make it tied? I couldn&#8217;t find a definitive answer but it made sense to me to be tied.</p>

<p>In bars 29 and 30, I decided to incorporate a suspiran, which is a technique I learned from an article by Peter Williams (1979).</p>

<p>Overall, I am pleased with how I was able to incorporate elements from Bach&#8217;s sonata into my composition, but I am aware that it may not sound as authentically Baroque as it could. Sometimes it sounds too contemporary. Possibly the pivotal question is this: How can we write in the style of a specific era if we have been influenced by later ones? This may be a constant challenge that composers face, and it&#8217;s something that I kept in mind throughout the composition process. Despite this, I am happy with the final result and how it captures the essence of the Baroque style while incorporating my own creative choices.</p>
