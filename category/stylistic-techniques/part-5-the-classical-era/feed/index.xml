										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It has been widely accepted since Lenz&#8217;s 1852 Beethoven biography that his musical journey can be distinguished into three distinct phases. In the first phase (1782-1802), he imitated Mozart and Haydn to fit the aesthetic of the time. The second phase (1803-1812) marked a period of stylistic evolution and the creation of his third to eighth symphonies. The third and final phase began around 1813 and involved experimentation with innovative sonorities. (Rogers, 1919).</p>



<p>The Pastoral Symphony, composed between 1807 and 1808, falls within the middle of Beethoven&#8217;s second phase, which was heavily influenced by the events explained in more detail <a href="./../../../../research-point-5-0/index.html" data-type="post" data-id="1317">here</a>, such as artistic innovations, political revolutions, wars, but also personal struggles such as the onset of his deafness. </p>



<p>Premiered in Vienna, Austria, on December 22nd, 1808, during a concert at which several of his works were premiered, including his 5th Symphony, the Pastoral Symphony is written for a typical orchestra of that period: piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones, timpani and strings (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1998a). </p>



<p>Since they both premiered at the same concert and were composed at around the same time, the contrast between Symphony No. 5 and Symphony No. 6 is a remarkable aspect worth noting. No. 5 is vigorous and varied, while No. 6 is calm and pastoral, with programmatic titles illustrating rural life as a refuge. Was this contrast deliberate on Beethoven&#8217;s part? Why did he choose to compose a programmatic symphony? And why a pastoral theme?</p>



<p>In order to answer the last question, one must consider the intersection of his personal history and the historical context in which he was creating. On the personal side, according to Allen (2017), Beethoven had a profound love for nature and often sought refuge from the bustle of urban life by retreating to the countryside. But in a historical context, Will (1994:166) analyses, the pastoral theme was the most common subject in programmatic symphonies during the Classical Period, and Beethoven might have found inspiration in earlier works such as Justin Heinrich Knecht&#8217;s 1784 symphony &#8220;Le portrait musical de la nature,&#8221; which shares a similar programmatic intent with Beethoven&#8217;s 6th Symphony. However, in opposition to other programmatic symphonies, Beethoven intended this work to be “more the Expression of Feeling than Tone-Panting”.</p>



<p>The question of tone-painting in Beethoven&#8217;s Pastoral Symphony has sparked much debate and was subject to extensive criticism in two reviews in 1810, published in AMZ 12 and Zeitung für die elegante Welt 10. These reviews provide valuable insights into the contemporary perception of tone-painting. While initially denouncing it as &#8220;the utmost in tastelessness,&#8221; the AMZ review later justifies Beethoven&#8217;s use of tone-painting to represent emotions, rather than physical objects. The continues stating that theorists of expression saw superficiality as one of the greatest faults of tone-painting (Will, 1994:158-160).</p>



<p>The review published in Zeitung provides further insight into the perception of the Pastoral Symphony&#8217;s tone-painting. The reviewer acknowledges that the symphony portrays emotions associated with the pastoral but goes on to argue that it is more than a generic representation of such emotions. Rather, the scenes depicted are specific episodes from the composer&#8217;s own experiences in the countryside, imbued with his personal emotions. Consequently, the reviewer deems tone-painting to be of secondary importance, with the focus instead on the power of the composer&#8217;s personality (Will, 1994:161).</p>



<p>In my opinion, the reviews made a clear effort to dismiss tone-painting and focus on how Beethoven conveyed emotions (personal or generic) revealing that both this symphony and the cultural environment of its time were undergoing a discernible transition from the classicist period to the romantic era, exhibiting traits and preferences that spanned both styles. This is a reminder that such transitions are not time-bound but rather an organic and gradual process marked by overlaps. </p>



<p>Ultimately, this raises questions that remained unresolved in my research. Specifically, as Beethoven transitioned from the patronage system to a broader audience-based system, did he prioritize the opinions of critics with regard to tone-painting? Additionally, what was his stance regarding the proposition that tone-painting was a manifestation of tastelessness? Could this potentially explain why this is his only symphony?</p>



<h5 id="6th-symphony-movements" class="wp-block-heading">6th Symphony Movements</h5>



<p>Pastoral Symphony&#8217;s first movement, &#8220;Awakening of Cheerful Feelings upon Arrival in the Country,&#8221; serves as a joyful prelude. It features simple melodies and light rhythm, with homophonic orchestration and primarily major keys. Beethoven minimizes unexpected shifts by repeating motifs and only briefly uses a minor key.</p>



<p>The second movement, titled &#8220;Scene by the Brook,&#8221; is a serene and peaceful composition that is free of the typical Germanic tension often associated with Beethoven&#8217;s music. The movement begins with a lilting rhythmic motion that is said to sound like the flowing of a brook.</p>



<p>The third movement, titled &#8220;Merry Gathering of the Country Folk,&#8221; is a Scherzo in ABA form, with the main theme having a rustic feel. The trio section has a particularly country dance feel, with a constant emphasis on the downbeat of each bar. The movement ends with a curtailed return to the main theme, followed by a faster presto section and a transition into the next movement.</p>



<p>The fourth movement, entitled &#8220;Thunderstorm,&#8221; is a dramatic and tension-filled episode that deviates from the overall tranquil character of the symphony. The storm is portrayed through the depiction of thunder and thunderclaps, and the movement ultimately subsides, coinciding with the gradual fading of the storm.</p>



<p>Continuing without interruption, the fifth and final movement of the symphony is entitled &#8220;Shepherd&#8217;s Song, happy and thankful feelings after the storm.&#8221; It is a delightful and evocative music that utilizes a gentle and rhythmic theme that is repeated throughout the rondo form of the movement. The movement ends with a quiet and prayerful coda as if wishing farewell to the countryside before returning to the city.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The first movement of the composition is in the sonata form, as exemplified in Figure 1. The introduction starts with a theme, that can be considered the first theme of the first subject area. The initial four bars come to a halt by means of the fermata over a sustained C major chord, dominant of F major.</p>

<p>By bar 5, the second theme belonging to the first subject area is introduced in the violas, accompanied by the violins that employ pre-existing motific material from the first theme. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><a href="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1400" width="486" height="159" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804.png 648w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804-300x98.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804-640x209.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The second theme of the first subject area played by the violas at bars 5-7</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within the initial 12 bars of the movement, Beethoven introduces the two principal themes that will serve as a significant guide throughout the piece, in addition to some hints of the motif&#8217;s development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1401" width="487" height="471" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24.png 974w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-300x290.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-768x743.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-640x619.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-960x928.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The first violins play a motific variation and the strings play the second theme of the first subject area at bars 8-12</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 16 comes an unexpected repetition on the strings. The first violins play the same rhythm as the second bar of the first theme, which lasts for 13 bars. The sole variation lies in the dynamics. This provides an indication of Beethoven&#8217;s approach to the symphony, characterized by repetitions, reutilization of motific material and a marked emphasis on dynamics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="265" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-1024x265.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1402" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-1024x265.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-300x78.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-768x199.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-1536x398.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-640x166.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-960x249.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33.png 1692w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The repetition on the violins at bars 17-22</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 29, the exposition section starts with a subdued presentation of the first theme initiated by the oboe, with the cellos and horns providing support. This theme is subsequently passed through the orchestra going through the clarinets and bassoons and finally with the strings. Notably, a sense of repetition is evident, as the same rhythm of the third bar of the first theme is repeated in the woodwinds and violins. However, the dynamics make all the difference in not making it seem stale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.06.29-1024x131.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1403" width="768" height="98" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.06.29-1024x131.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.06.29-300x38.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.06.29-768x98.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.06.29-640x82.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.06.29-960x123.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.06.29.png 1342w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Violins playing the same rhythm as the third bar of the first theme at bars 43-48 </figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 46, Beethoven employs his first instance of tone-painting in the symphony, with the flutes performing a birdsong. This technique, however, is used sparingly throughout the first movement, with only one other occurrence observed during the recapitulation. This brings back the question of Beethoven&#8217;s intention with respect to tone painting. Was he conflicted between differing views on the technique, or was he experimenting with it in a playful or provocative manner, perhaps testing the reactions of audiences and critics?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1404" width="555" height="107" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05.png 740w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05-300x58.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05-640x123.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Birdsong on the flutes at bars 46-48</figcaption></figure>



<p>Suddenly, at bar 53, a change in texture occurs as the clarinets and bassoons, followed by the horns, introduce a triplet theme, played over the rhythm of the first bar of the first theme. Once again, Beethoven employs repetition to great effect, inducing heightened tension as the triplet motif interrupts the expected continuation of the primary theme.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-1024x258.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1405" width="640" height="161" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-1024x258.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-300x76.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-768x194.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-640x161.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-960x242.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53.png 1364w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The horns play triples while the first violins play a variation of the first theme at bars 55-62</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 67, a traditional sonata change to the dominant key of C marks the beginning of the second subject area. The first theme is introduced by the first violin and subsequently transferred to all string instruments, followed by all woodwinds. Beethoven employs the same technique of repeating the theme, marked by a dynamic and instrumental buildup.</p>



<p>At bar 93, Beethoven introduces the second theme of the second subject area, which is characterized by a clear question-and-answer structure between the strings and woodwinds. The dynamics employed in this structure are noteworthy, as the question is played f while the answer is played p.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-1024x241.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1407" width="640" height="150" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-1024x241.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-300x71.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-768x181.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-640x151.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-960x226.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58.png 1375w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The oboe provides an answer to the first violins question at bars 93-99</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bar 111 marks the return of the triplets, providing a sense of a faster rhythm and subsequently leading to a prolonged repetition over a C pedal tone. The first two bars of the first theme of the first subject area are then repeated, which results in a substantial buildup of tension.</p>



<p>Based on my analysis, the development section starts at bar 151, marked by the modulation to Bb Major and the reappearance of the triplet rhythm, along with a slightly varied part of the second bar of the first theme of the first subject area. Notably, the development section is an unconventional deviation from the traditional expectation of dramatic and innovative contrast to the exposition. Instead, it features a static and repetitive section transposed into different keys. It actually reminded me of the Prelude in Wagner&#8217;s Das Rheingold, which builds in the intensity of dynamics and instrumentation while maintaining a constant motif.</p>

<p>Bar 237 marks a key change to A Major where both the first and second themes from the first subject area make an appearance. The second theme is subsequently repeated, leading to a brief modulation to the minor key at bar 255, and finally to C Major at bar 263. While some might contend that the brief modulation to the minor key gives the development section the expected dramatism, it is, in fact, brief and it&#8217;s not repeated again.</p>



<p>At bar 282, the music reaches a moment of pause, with only the violin playing a trill, suggesting the arrival of the recapitulation and the return of the first theme. However, the second theme from the first subject area reappears, leaving the listener uncertain about whether the development section has ended. There&#8217;s a sense of false start, through persistent repetition that builds in dynamics, until the first theme from the first subject is ultimately played by all the instruments of the orchestra featured in the movement at bar 312, thereby indicating the start of the recapitulation.</p>



<p>The recapitulation goes back, as expected by classical sonata form, to both subject areas but in the tonic key of F Major. Notably, Beethoven chooses to initiate this section with a ff dynamic, rather than following the softer dynamic of the exposition, thereby contradicting the expectations. In the final stages of the recapitulation, the dynamics and texture gradually decrease, leading to a reduced level of tension as the music moves towards the coda.</p>



<p>The coda starts in bar 418 with a modulation to Bb Major, which I found unexpected. However, this modulation is brief, as it modulates back to F Major in measure 440. Beethoven utilizes dynamics that range from pp to ff, which creates a sense of uncertainty regarding the music&#8217;s conclusion, as he plays with the audience&#8217;s expectations. This leaves uncertainty about the end of the music until the orchestra ends playing.</p>



<p>After my research and analysis, my opinion is that Beethoven found himself composing this Symphony in times of change, where he was balancing his classical influences with a desire to establish himself as a disruptive composer and build the pavement for the romantic era. Beethoven&#8217;s use of traditional sonata form, such as the question/answer construction and the modulations in the development section, reflect his attachment to the classical principles of order and balance, while his exploration of static harmony for long periods and the repetition of a motif while exploring dynamics and timbres demonstrates his forward-thinking approach.</p>



<p>Additionally, Beethoven was also grappling with the concept of tone-painting and trying to appeal to a broader audience, which may have influenced his decision to use the natural world as a thematic focus in this symphony. Furthermore, the composer&#8217;s personal struggles with increasing deafness likely added a layer of complexity to his creative process and may have impacted his artistic choices in this work. </p>

<p>Although not typically drawn to classical guitar compositions, I discovered the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos&#8217; (1887-1957) 12 Études for Guitar and decided to listen to it.</p>



<p>Heitor Villa-Lobos is widely regarded as one of the foremost composers of Latin American music in the 20th century. His work is notable for its unique synthesis of Western classical music and traditional Brazilian folk songs and rhythms. Among his many notable works are the Etudes, composed in 1928 and dedicated to the renowned guitarist Andres Segovia. Alongside their didactic function, these pieces are often featured in live performances due to their musical richness and technical demands.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Heitor Villa-lobos - 12 Études for Guitar (Score video)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JP8R7JBu_UM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>A few of the études caught my attention.</p>



<p>Study No. 1, employs the technique of right-hand arpeggio. The formula is fixed, interrupted only in measures 23-24. The Study can be divided into three sections: the first section goes until measure 11, which is characterized by stability in the harmony. The second section runs from measure 12 to measure 22, where the arpeggios move down the scale by step, with a pedal E bass note. The third section covers measures 23 to 33, where the range of the notes is expanded. The study was symmetrically constructed with sections of 11 measures. The beauty of this piece lies in the cyclical repetition of each bar, which effectively generates a sense of tension and release.</p>



<p>Study No. 4 is centred on the continuous repetition of chords in the right hand while extensively exploring the harmonic capabilities of the guitar. I hear in these chords elements that anticipate the emergence of Brazilian popular music and bossa nova in the years following its composition.</p>



<p>Study No. 10 is characterized by a range of idiomatic resources and technical challenges, including the use of open strings as pedal notes and ornamental techniques for accompanying open strings. The first 20 bars of the piece are constructed around a fixed position of the left hand, which ascends chromatically, creating a sense of mounting tension. I believe this section showcases Villa-Lobos&#8217; skilful use of harmonic and melodic devices to create a dynamic and engaging piece of music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Upon watching an Instagram Reel by David Asher Brown on Venezuelan merengue and its unique 5/8 rhythm, I decided to explore one of the genre&#8217;s most renowned compositions, Acidito. The song was composed by Adelis Fréitez and has been popularized by several singers and bands. </p>



<p>Cecilia Todd Vallenilla is a well-known Venezuelan musician, recognized for her performances of traditional Venezuelan folk music. She is especially skilled in playing the cuatro, which she uses to accompany herself in performances both within Venezuela and abroad.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Cecilia Todd - Acidito - Encuentro en el Estudio - Temporada 7" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o20jefoabvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Upon close listening, it became clear that the 5/8 rhythm of Venezuelan merengue, as described by David Asher Brown, feels natural without any apparent sense of strain. The natural quality of this rhythmic structure may be attributed to the tempo at which it is played.</p>



<p>After looking at the bass score, I realized that it consists of a two-quaver and one-crotchet rhythm. This raises the question of where the accent falls, whether it is on the first or the fifth beat. Based on the position of the break and the melodic leap, it appears that the accent may be on the fifth beat, although I may not be entirely right.</p>

<p>Beethoven’s String Quartet Op. 18, No. 1 is the first of six quartets that were published together in 1801, known as the Op. 18 quartets. These quartets were written during Beethoven&#8217;s early period, and they represent a transition from the classical style of Haydn and Mozart to Beethoven&#8217;s unique and innovative approach to composition.</p>



<p>This is a composition that greatly impressed me due to its spirited and multifaceted character, full of energy, pathos, and even elements of humour, with abrupt pauses and deceptive endings. The first movement is marked by a playful and vigorous tone, gravitating around the opening motive and employing diverse variations of it throughout the piece. The second movement, by contrast, evokes a more serious and intense atmosphere, that some scholars suggest was inspired by the burial scene in Romeo and Juliet. The third movement, in turn, features a sprightly Scherzo and Trio. Finally, the Allegro finale provides an entertaining and engaging end to the composition, employing silence strategically to evoke a sense of surprise and delight among the audience.</p>



<p>The quartet features a balanced distribution of roles among the instruments. The first violin carries the primary melodic lines, while the other instruments have some supportive role, even though they play monophonically sometime. Indeed, a dynamic interplay exists among the instruments, with the primary melody traversing through all parts.</p>



<p>In my experience, some minor alterations were necessary when arranging a string quartet for solo piano, such as adjusting the harmonies to suit the pianists&#8217; hand limitations. However, the essential character of the quartet can still be captured by a piano, even though it can never catch the dynamic strength of four instruments. I think this is more noticeable in passages with sforzando, like the one in bar 22.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Beatles&#8217; &#8220;Here, There and Everywhere&#8221; is a lyrical and melodic love song, and according to Paul McCartney&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Beatles&#8217; &#8220;Here, There and Everywhere&#8221; is a lyrical and melodic love song, and according to Paul McCartney in the McCartney 1, 2, 3 documentary, it is his favourite melody he composed. Despite its compelling melody, it is strange, for me, that it&#8217;s not as well-known as other Beatles love songs such as &#8220;Something&#8221; or &#8220;And I Love Her.&#8221; Nevertheless, the explicit lyrics leave no room for doubt that the singer wants the lover to be present at all times and everywhere, which makes the theme of the song relatable and impactful.</p>



<p>The structure of the song is intriguing because there is ambiguity about which parts serve as the verse or chorus. There is no melodic and harmonic division that lets the listener distinguish which one serves as chorus or verse. Instead, it is easier to structure the song as Introduction &#8211; A &#8211; B &#8211; A &#8211; B &#8211; A.</p>



<p>Looking closer at the harmony, it is remarkable that the song has two modulations, which is uncommon in pop music, especially considering the song&#8217;s brief 2:24 minute runtime. The song is in the key of G major, and the first modulation happens in the A section, where the music shifts to the relative minor, E, with an F#m7 chord followed by a B major chord, and then moves to E minor chord shifting back to the key of G major.</p>



<p>The other modulation occurs in the B section, where the song modulates to Bb major. This is a relatively dramatic shift, but it is attenuated with preparation at the end of the A section, where the melody sings a Bb note before moving to the B section.</p>



<p>The melody is what I like the most about this music, especially the leap that first appears at bar 5. Upon closer inspection, this leap is similar to SZA&#8217;s &#8220;Kill Bill&#8221; melody (I wrote about it here), which employs an upward preparation followed by a descent with a longer duration. This is a good melodic technique that contributes to the song&#8217;s appeal.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="120" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1-1024x120.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1433" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1-1024x120.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1-300x35.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1-768x90.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1-1536x180.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1-640x75.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1-960x113.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1.png 1587w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kill Bill melody line</figcaption></figure>



<p>The vocal harmonies in the song are simple and effective. According to the producer George Martin, &#8220;the boys&#8221; hummed basic triads behind the melody, resulting in moving block harmonies.</p>



<p>The song&#8217;s arrangement never seems to settle, similar to the Beach Boys&#8217; &#8220;God Only Knows,&#8221; which was, in fact, an inspiration for McCartney when he wrote, &#8220;Here, There and Everywhere.&#8221;</p>



<p>In conclusion, &#8220;Here, There and Everywhere&#8221;, for me, is a great example of a love song that demonstrates mastery of melody and harmony, but also simplicity. It is an excellent example of pop music that uses modulation effectively.</p>

<p>In Part 5 of this unit, we further explore our comprehension of the Classical Era by examining music on various levels that comprise it. Initially, we obtained a general understanding of the social, political, economic, and cultural circumstances of the era and the influence of significant historical events on this movement. This was a beneficial starting point in comprehending the background and customs of the Classical composers, as well as the innovations they introduced.</p>



<p>Regarding the music itself, the analysis process was usually very similar: listening to the piece following the score, adding annotations to key moments such as themes, sections and modulations, and passages of special textural and sonic interest.</p>



<p>During this particular part, the study of Sonata form held great significance as it allowed me to comprehend how a rigid structure could shape a musical piece or movement. Furthermore, it helped me understand how it offered the composers the flexibility to deviate from the established norms and infuse their own creativity. A prime example of this is Mozart&#8217;s Sonata No.15 in C major for Pianoforte, where he subtly alters the recapitulation by beginning it in the Dominant Key instead of the expected Tonic. Alternatively, some composers such as Bartók, choose to utilize only the fundamental elements of the Sonata form, as demonstrated in the example we analyzed.</p>



<p>Picking on this contrast between Mozart, Haydn and Bartók, I found also helpful to contrast compositions from different eras to identify their unique stylistic features and better appreciate their creative innovations. </p>



<p>Given that the Sonata form embodies the fundamental principles of classicism, emphasizing balance and elegance, it was expected to see that these composers followed these rigid structures. But analysis of the pieces brought to the surface how they crafted remarkable and captivating pieces that respected the structural conventions of the form they employed, while still managing to surprise and delight the listener.</p>



<p>One additional finding after going through different analyses of pieces of this era was that tonal relationships and thematic development were important features of classical works.</p>



<p>Personally, I find the process of &#8220;unpacking&#8221; a composition to be simultaneously fascinating and exhausting. On the one hand, it offers a privileged behind-the-scenes look at the composition, as if one were unravelling the very mind of the composer, as Cook (1987) aptly notes. On the other hand, this process can be time-consuming and arduous, in stark contrast to the simple act of listening to and experiencing a piece. It&#8217;s not uncommon to spend days analyzing a mere 20-minute composition, only to realize that there is still much left to uncover. Nonetheless, this meticulous approach often leads to a newfound appreciation and respect for a work that might have initially appeared less complex than it truly is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Steve Reich (born October 3, 1936,&nbsp;New York, U.S.)  is one of the greatest living composers. He is considered one of the greatest contributors to the minimalist music movement with a style based on repetitive and rhythmic patterns. His compositions often feature a limited number of instruments.</p>



<p>In 1988, Steve Reich created &#8220;Different Trains,&#8221; a three-part composition featuring a string quartet and excerpts from audio recordings. This highly personal work draws inspiration from Reich&#8217;s recollections of his Jewish upbringing in the United States and his train voyages across the country. The piece&#8217;s themes are further contextualized by the vastly different connotations associated with train travel during World War II in Europe, where the transportation of Jews took on an entirely different significance.</p>



<p>The pioneering aspect of the composition lies in its integration of prerecorded sounds with a live string quartet. Sourced from a range of records featuring diverse train sounds and spoken-word samples, including those from Holocaust survivors, this unique blend of live performance and recorded sounds lend a layer of profundity and authenticity to the piece. In particular, the first movement stands out for its complete fusion of the strings and recordings, with the latter serving as the motivic ideas that the strings then elaborate upon. This creative approach, innovative for its time, elevates &#8220;Different Trains&#8221; to a remarkable work of art.</p>



<p>Across all three movements, a continuous repetition of sounds and patterns interlock and build upon one another, creating a rich and almost hypnotic soundscape. While this reinforces the rhythmic motion of a train, it also enables the listener to become fully immersed in the 30-minute journey of an industrialized landscape, transitioning into haunting melodies and ultimately concluding on a hopeful note. </p>



<p>While I was unable to discern any conventional chord progressions commonly found in classical string quartets, I observed a pronounced typical rhythmic texture primarily conveyed through the strings. In my opinion, this rhythmic quality injects the composition with a sense of emotion, motion, and intrigue, preventing it from succumbing to monotony and repetitiveness.</p>



<p>In my view, the most fascinating aspect of &#8220;Different Trains&#8221; lies in its harmonious melding of realism and emotion. The inclusion of train whistles and station sounds fosters a vivid and evocative soundscape, while the voices infused throughout the piece infuse a human element that heightens the profound emotional depth already conveyed through the strings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cook (1987) raises a compelling argument regarding analysing music, which resonated with me in the few analysis I made during this course: how intimate you become with the music the more time you spend analysing it as if you&#8217;re unravelling the very mind of the composer. However, Cook also points out that to get that intimacy with the piece and closeness with the composer, one must know what questions to ask during an analysis. And here&#8217;s where analytical methods are important.</p>



<p>Musical analysis can cover a spectrum of considerations such as the social, historical and aesthetic factors and expressive content, as well as more formal analysis concerned to form, melodic, harmonic and rhythmic content.</p>



<p>One of the most recognized formal analyses was created by Heinrich Schenker in the years before the second world war and developed ever since. Cook refers to it as the &#8220;Schenkerian Analysis&#8221; that works very well with tonal music. Schenkerian theory proposes that music is made up of various layers: the ursatz or fundamental structure, which is a two-voice structure that forms the basis for an analytical approach to examine the complexities of a piece; the middle ground which consists of inter-relating the actual foreground of the music with the imaginary voices of the background (Cook, 1987); the foreground or surface level. </p>

The 123’s of Schenkerian Analysis</em> (no date). Available at: https://academic.udayton.edu/PhillipMagnuson/soundpatterns/perspec/123graphing.html.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another field of analysis is the semiotic one, which Jean-Jacques Nattiez is a proponent, does not concern itself with too much the diatonic framework, but rather with the repetition of units and analyzing how they used throughout the piece. </p>



<p>There is also the Set Theory, developed by Milton Babbitt and later Allen Forte. It can be used on any kind of music, including atonal music. Set theory primarily deals with pitch classes, which refer to the &#8220;character&#8221; of a pitch. This analytical approach that allows for the description of all pitch and interval class collections, without relying on the traditional triadic or tonal functions. The result is a reduction in the total number of sets, making the process more manageable and accessible.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This String Quartet got my attention right at the beginning. The opening is a slow and haunting Adagio&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This String Quartet got my attention right at the beginning. The opening is a slow and haunting Adagio introduction, which features discordant harmonies that create a sense of tension and unease. The pulsating cello descends chromatically leaving a harmonic ambiguity that surprised me. I wasn&#8217;t expecting this kind of introduction by Mozart. The other strings keep playing colliding notes, while the dynamics keep going from p to f and back to p. These 22 bars of the Adagio create a stark contrast with the subsequent Allegro movement, which is characterized by its lively and playful nature.</p>



<p>This string quartet in C major was composed in 1785 and is part of the set of six quartets composed between 1782 and 1785 that he dedicated to Joseph Haydn. This introduction was so innovative and disruptive for its time that it received mixed reviews from critics, publishers and players.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A string quartet is generally composed of two violins, a viola and one cello and is typically viewed&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A string quartet is generally composed of two violins, a viola and one cello and is typically viewed as a genre of music that is like a conversation. In fact, in a letter from 1829, addressed to the composer Carl Friedrich Zelter, Goethe compared the string quartet to &#8220;a stimulating conversation between four intelligent people&#8221; and saw in it &#8220;the most comprehensible of instrumental music genres.&#8221; </p>



<p>The evolution of the string quartet is not entirely clear, although there seems to be an inclination towards the divertimento genre and the Baroque Trio Sonata as possible sources of influence. What is clear is that the string quartet grew in popularity due to its low cost and ease of rehearsal. It was also the ideal size for small home gatherings and allowed for more freedom in composing. In addition to its practicality, the string quartet is also thought to have reflected the aesthetic values of the Enlightenment era: its intimate conversation with equal participation of all voices, as well as its capacity to convey a deep musical thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although other composers such as Holzbauer, Wagenseil, Allegri, and Scarlatti had explored the string quartet, it is Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) who is widely regarded as &#8220;the father of the string quartet.&#8221; While he did not invent the genre, he made the most significant contributions to defining it, composing a total of 68 quartets. Initially, the quartets he wrote were primarily centred on the first violin, with the viola and cello doubling the melody. However, over time, he evolved the texture to be more uniform in terms of the instruments&#8217; importance. Furthermore, he also refined the form, initially starting with five movements, like the divertimento genre, but later settling on four movements, with the first one in sonata form.</p>



<p>Mozart was another influential composer who helped develop the string quartet, notably with the six pieces dedicated to Haydn and the three dedicated to Frederick William II of Prussia. These quartets are regarded as mature works and reflect the style established by Haydn.</p>



<p>Beethoven was influenced by the work of Haydn and Mozart. While his first six quartets, Op.18 (1798–1800), adhered to the established string quartet framework, his three Razumovsky quartets, Opus 59 (1806), are regarded as reflecting his transition towards Romanticism and are widely considered to be among his finest works.</p>



<p>In the 19th century, some composers moved away from classical forms, like Liszt, Wagner, and Richard Strauss, resulting in a decrease in quartet composition. However, Antonín Dvořák wrote 14 quartets. The quartet regained popularity among composers during the Modern era, playing a key role in the works of Debussy, Ravel, Schoenberg, Bartók, and Shostakovich. In the late 20th century the genre still has some composers interested in developing it, such as Karlheinz Stockhausen&#8217;s Helikopter-Quartett composed in 1992-93. Composers such as Riley, Glass, Reich and John Adams produced string quartets in their own style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The texture of the main theme can be seen as a four-part counterpoint as each instrument has its own independent line. However, when listening to this section, one perceives a distinct melody on the first violin supported by the accompaniment, especially in the viola and the cello.</p>



<p>In the first variation, the second violin plays the melody while the first violin plays an arpeggiated figure. I&#8217;m not sure if this is considered a two-part counterpoint because there is no distinct melody on the first violin. Nonetheless, the first violin&#8217;s role feels more like an accompaniment. Upon listening to this variation, one can perceive that both instruments are connected, especially in bar 36 when both instruments reach their climax at the same time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="343" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-1024x343.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1358" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-1024x343.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-300x101.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-768x257.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-1536x515.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-640x214.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-960x322.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18.png 1916w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bars 35-37</figcaption></figure>



<p>The second variation has a richer texture. The cello takes on the primary melody, while the second violin initially moves homophonically with the cello before gradually diverging and converging with the first violin. The first violin features a distinct melody that starts out thin and gradually becomes denser as the variation progresses. Meanwhile, The viola has a simple accompaniment part. This variation can be seen as a three-part counterpoint.</p>



<p>The third variation presents a more intricate texture and a chromatic sound. The viola takes on the primary melody, while the two violins play their own distinct melodies. The cello remains silent for eight bars, but upon entering, it creates an intensely chromatic feeling in bars 69-71, perhaps due to its bass sound serving as the foundation for the chords. This variation appears to have a four-part counterpoint, featuring highly independent lines. However, there are moments where the voices seem to be rhythmically coordinated.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="336" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-1024x336.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1362" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-1024x336.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-300x98.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-768x252.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-1536x504.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-640x210.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-960x315.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-1920x632.png 1920w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30.png 1928w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bars 69-71</figcaption></figure>



<p>The final variation returns to the simplicity of the first variations. The main melody is played by the first violin, and the other voices serve to support it while retaining their unique character. It may not necessarily qualify as a definitive four-part counterpoint. The texture is much more compact compared to the previous variation, and it becomes particularly crisp in bars 91-97, where all instruments play in their upper register.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="370" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-1024x370.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1361" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-1024x370.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-300x108.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-768x278.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-1536x555.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-2048x741.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-640x231.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-960x347.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42.png 2428w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bars 92-95</figcaption></figure>



<p>The main difference between the first and second movements is that in the latter the texture shifts from one variation to the next, but remains constant within each individual variation. In the first movement, the texture continuously changes without a discernible pattern or structure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I find investigations such as the one conducted on Haydn&#8217;s Emperor to be extremely useful, particularly when seeking to bridge the gap between the emotional and rational aspects of classical music. When casually listening to a piece, we can often become consumed by the emotions it evokes, without giving much thought to how they are conveyed. However, investigating the structure and development of a composition, as well as the techniques used by the composer, provides us with a more rational understanding of the music. Through investigation, we can better appreciate the intricate and intentional ways in which the music is made to bring out specific emotional responses and enhance our overall listening experience.</p>



<p>Through this investigation, I gained a deeper understanding of the Sonata form and how it can be developed with different themes. I also gained a new understanding of the techniques used by composers to create a musical journey that navigates from the home key to a distant key and back again. This exploration reminded me that musical forms are not rigid structures, but rather malleable frameworks that composers can use as they see fit, much like Bartók did.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I found the investigative approach to be extremely useful, as it provided me with a structured framework for future analysis. Starting with a broad perspective and progressively digging into specific details:</p>



<ul>
<li>Identify the form</li>



<li>Identify themes and keys</li>



<li>Outline the structure</li>



<li>Establish how the transitions of keys and sections are made</li>



<li>Analyse how themes are built and used throughout the piece</li>
</ul>



<p>One thing that is missing from this analysis is to consider the broader musical landscape at the time of composition, such as the prevailing trends and techniques used by other composers. By understanding the broader musical context, we can better appreciate what makes a piece unique and significant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The piece begins in C major and the first four bars present the themes and are very homogenous in terms of rhythm between the instruments. This and the perfect cadences convey a sense of comfort and stability</p>



<p>The key continues to be C major until bar 13, where the first theme modulates. This brings a confusing mood to the piece, where the centre of tonality seems to be lost. I get the sense that it moves to E, before having the pedal note in D. This pedal tone creates a lot of tension, before establishing the new key.</p>



<p>In the second subject area, the piece moves to the secondary dominant key of G. This feels fresh but still in a bright mood. However, the piece momentarily shifts to G minor at bar 29, creating an edgy and uncertain mood. Overall, this section has a sense of stability but provides unexpected twists and turns, keeping the listener engaged.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Béla Bartók (1881 &#8211; 1945) was a Hungarian composer, and one of the most influential figures in 20th-century&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Béla Bartók (1881 &#8211; 1945) was a Hungarian composer, and one of the most influential figures in 20th-century music. His pieces are known for their extensive chromaticism and novel rhythms. He is known for collecting and studying authentic Hungarian folk music and incorporating them into his music. He wrote six string quartets which were among his most impressive achievements, being the fourth, the most celebrated.</p>



<p>The String Quartet No.4 has five movements that are written symmetrically. It contains two sets of identical movements with a middle movement which is the central point of the quartet. Here is Bartók explaining it:</p>



<p>&#8220;The work is in five movements; their character corresponds to Classical sonata form. The slow movement is the kernel of the work; the other movements are, as it were, arranged in layers around it. Movement IV is a free variation of II, and I and V have the same thematic material; that is, around the kernel (Movement III), metaphorically speaking, I and V are the outer, II and IV the inner layers.&#8221; (Keller, 2011).</p>



<p>Although Bartók suggests that the nature of the first and final movements corresponds with that of the Classical sonata form, I believe that he merely employed the concept of the sonata form and utilized it liberally as a framework for his composition, without adhering rigorously to its conventions. Distinct motifs are present in the quartet, rather than explicitly articulated themes as found in the sonatas of Beethoven or Haydn. These motific ideas tend to appear for a very short time and disappear quickly. This reminds me of Debussy.</p>



<p>Upon listening to this piece for the first time, I found it much harder to distinguish the sonata sections, in contrast to Haydn&#8217;s quartet, wherein such segments were easily discernible. However, after reading the score and watching Andreyev&#8217;s analysis, I was able to understand the structure of the piece, the division of the sections, and the appearance of each motif.<br></p>



<p>When listening to the entire movement, I found it to be incredibly radical and challenging to follow. This left me confused, especially knowing that Bartók employs several counterpoint techniques that are commonly used in the works of many Western composers, including contrary motion, imitation, inversions, and call-and-response.</p>

<p>Bartók demonstrates an innovative use of the quartet by investigating the sonorities of the three instruments through techniques such as extreme note ranges, varied glissandos, and his unique interpretation of pizzicato, which involves a vigorous plucking motion that produces a sharp snap upon the string&#8217;s impact with the instrument.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>All art evolves in a cultural, social, and political context and music is no exception. The birth of the Classicism in the 18th Century can be traced to the following phenomena: Enlightenment, democratization, humanism, the emergence of the middle class and the development of new musical styles and instruments.</p>



<p>The Enlightenment  (1685 – 1815) was a transformative era in history that rejected traditional ideas of the time and emphasized the importance of reason and logic. It advocated for a rational, scientific approach to life in contrast to superstition and traditionalism. As critical thinking gained traction, it posed a challenge to the established church and organized religion.</p>



<p>During this period, political upheavals and conflicts were prevalent. The American and French Revolutions, the War of the Austrian Succession, and the Seven Years&#8217; War, among others, played a significant role in shaping the ideals of the epoch, highlighting the significance of equal rights. It led to a steep rising in democratization.</p>



<p>Economically, land was no longer the only source of income. With the advent of manufacturing and trading, job opportunities and skills emerged. Individuals were no longer defined solely by their family background, but by their professions. This transformation led to the emergence of the middle class, which in turn put pressure on society to change institutions and improve their standard of living, income, and social mobility.</p>



<p>In terms of intellectual evolution, humanistic ideas regained their prominence and a newfound belief that life on earth is as important as life after death challenged the church&#8217;s traditional stance. Prominent French intellectuals such as Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau spoke out against outdated concepts of aristocracy, class divisions, and religious and racial prejudices.</p>



<p>During this time, society began to view science and art as complementary rather than opposing forces. There was an increase in the importance of creating harmony and harmony in all aspects of life. The Encyclopaedia of Diderot d’Alembert was a great example of this cross-disciplinary collaboration, as it aimed to gather knowledge from all different areas, including music.</p>



<p>All this led to profound changes in music. </p>



<p>Music was previously only available to the elite, but The Enlightenment changed how music was written and distributed. The music industry became more profitable, and composers were able to earn a living for themselves. Music was democratized, and composers began writing more freely for public concerts pursuing a greater emphasis on the structure of the piece and creating simpler harmonic functions. This led to a departure from the elaborate ornamentation of the Baroque music era.</p>



<p>Musical tastes of the middle-class criteria favoured tuneful, clear and homophonic sounds. The piano, invented in the late Baroque, was capable of greater dynamic sensitivity. Similarly, the violin underwent significant technical changes, resulting in increased range and sound projection. </p>
