</h2>



<p>The feedback from my tutor was generally positive, with a focus on cautioning against pushing the harmonic rules too far. The tutor also emphasized the importance of understanding the use of dissonances and suggested exploring the incorporation of mordents to introduce more character into the piece, instead of the abundance of trills.</p>



<p>Taking these comments into consideration, I proceeded to revise both the score and my own reflections. In terms of the score, I aimed to simplify it, recognizing that certain passages appeared overcrowded and could benefit from enhanced clarity. Specifically, I addressed the conclusion by removing a trill that contained a leap to the final G note. However, I retained an ornament in the last bar, which I believe now presents a more elegant and Bach-inspired style.</p>



<p>Other alterations:</p>



<p>In bars 1 and 2, instead of having a descending sequence, I repeated the notes of the Right Hand in each chord to establish better the harmony.</p>



<p>In bar 6 I changed the G octave to a F octave in the violin to fit the Bb chord beneath.</p>



<p>In bar 7, I changed the Right Hand to start the arpeggio in an E flat instead of G, to create a descending sequence from the previous bars.</p>



<p>In bars 10 and 11 I changed the Right Hand line to become more smooth.</p>



<p>In bars 15-16 and bar 23-24 I replaced the long and unresolved note with a resolution.</p>



<p>In bar 20 and bar 30 I replaced the trill with a mordent.</p>

		<span>Revised reflection</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>I approached this assignment by first thinking about the piece&#8217;s structure, drawing inspiration from Bach&#8217;s violin sonata. I researched various baroque dances, such as the Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, and Gigue, and decided to use the Allemande as a primary inspiration because of its 4/4 meter and binary form. After going through the chords several times, I decided to make my piece in binary form as well: the first section from bar 1 to bar 16 and the second from bar 17 to bar 33.</p>



<p>I chose the first section to be 16 bars long, as this is a common length for the first section of dances like Allemande and Bach&#8217;s sonata. Additionally, the perfect cadence from bar 15 (C major) to bar 16 (F major) and the transition from F major to Bb major in bar 17 made it a logical choice. The presence of rehearsal letters also hinted that there would be a break in this section.</p>



<p>As soon as I determined the structure of my composition, <a href="./../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" target="_blank">I reviewed my previous analysis of Bach&#8217;s violin sonata to better understand his techniques</a>. </p>



<p>My composition plan was to introduce the main theme of the sonata in the first bars and then explore it with repetitions and variations until the end of the A section. The B section would start with a similar theme, but with some slight changes to keep it fresh and then move to the main theme until the end of the piece.</p>



<p>One of the challenges I faced right at the beginning of the composition was finding the right rhythms and notes. I tried several combinations and ideas but I ended up feeling that they didn&#8217;t match the Baroque style I was aiming for. Either sounded too simple or too uninteresting. My solution was to borrow material from my previous exercise, which was based on Bach&#8217;s Sonata for Viola da Gamba &amp; Harpsichord in G Minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="676" height="242" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1165" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png 676w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-300x107.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-640x229.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Exercise 3.4 theme</figcaption></figure>



<p>But even after finding a theme, I wasn&#8217;t satisfied with how it sounded in the first four bars, so I decided to begin it at rehearsal mark A (bar 5) and develop it from there. Overall, I was pleased with how the melody turned out and specifically enjoyed applying the lessons I learned from Bach by allowing the C# in bar 8 to move to bar 9 instead of resolving to D.</p>



<p>There was a challenge with the first 4 bars since I lacked ideas as to what to do in order to make them interesting. My solution was to write an introduction that hinted at the main theme&#8217;s rhythm, as a preview of what was to come. Despite not being able to find out whether an introduction was common to the Baroque style, I decided to include it since it made sense in this composition.</p>



<p>My goal in the B section was to make the violin sound freer, but not totally different from the previous section. In order to achieve this, I kept the tied note and the three descending notes from the main theme.</p>



<p>The next step was ornamenting the violin and the treble harpsichord. I looked into Taylor (1998), Apel (1969) and Bach (1949) for guidance and kept in mind that Bach used ornaments that were perfectly in time. The main difficulty I faced was understanding how to write the first and final notes on the trills regarding the previous and the next note. For example, in bars 2 and 12, the previous note is the same upper note of the trill. Should the player play it two times or make it tied? I couldn&#8217;t find a definitive answer but it made sense to me to be tied.</p>

<p>In bars 29 and 30, I decided to incorporate a suspiran, which is a technique I learned from an article by Peter Williams (1979).</p>

<p>Overall, I am pleased with how I was able to incorporate elements from Bach&#8217;s sonata into my composition, but I am aware that it may not sound as authentically Baroque as it could. Sometimes it sounds too contemporary. Possibly the pivotal question is this: How can we write in the style of a specific era if we have been influenced by later ones? This may be a constant challenge that composers face, and it&#8217;s something that I kept in mind throughout the composition process. Despite this, I am happy with the final result and how it captures the essence of the Baroque style while incorporating my own creative choices.</p>

<p>After receiving feedback from my tutor, it became evident that the second species exercise required more work. The tutor highlighted that the melody felt like it was split in two and also drew attention to the downward direction following a leap. With these feedbacks in mind, I proceeded to rework the second species exercise.</p>



<h4 id="first-species" class="wp-block-heading">First Species</h4>



<p>Using the tips from the First Species, I created a melodic line that was always consonant and moved mostly in contrary motion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="347" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-1-1024x347.png" alt="" class="wp-image-898" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-1-1024x347.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-1-300x102.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-1-768x260.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-1-1536x520.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-1-2048x694.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-1-640x217.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-1-960x325.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-1.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 id="second-species" class="wp-block-heading">Second Species</h4>



<p>This was my second attempt at this exercise. My attention was on bar 3 and 4, where I aimed to establish a connection between the melody and the required D note in bar 4. I chose to make a leap in bar 3, followed by an ascending and descending line, resulting in a melody that fluctuates between C and G.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="347" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-V2-2-1024x347.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1477" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-V2-2-1024x347.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-V2-2-300x102.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-V2-2-768x260.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-V2-2-1536x520.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-V2-2-2048x694.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-V2-2-640x217.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-V2-2-960x325.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-V2-2.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h4 id="third-species" class="wp-block-heading">Third Species</h4>



<p>Due to the pre-given patterns in bar 4  (nota cambiata pattern) and bar 6 (double neighbour pattern) in the third species, I started this species backwards in bar 6. Even with the given patterns, I tried to maintain a fluid melodic line with no big leaps, and always respected the previous species&#8217; guidelines.</p>

<p>Since the suspension must be resolved downwards and in consonance with the upbeat, I found this one to be the easiest species.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As compared to the previous species, the fifth one took me a lot lI wasn&#8217;t sure how the bass and alto should harmonize with the tenor while imitating each other. Jacob Gran&#8217;s video helped me realize we should make the three-voice counterpoint as harmonically complete as possible. Thus, for example, in bar 3, the bass is supposed to imitate the tenor by going from D to F, but that would be dissonant. The right choice is E since it makes a C major triad.</p>

</h2>



<p>This assignment provided me with significant learning outcomes, enriching my understanding of the piece and expanding my research skills. Given my background in writing, I find it more comfortable and efficient to compose an essay rather than a musical piece. Once again, I found the word limit somewhat restrictive for what I wanted to write, but I recognize that such constraints serve to ensure the essay remains focused on essential aspects.</p>



<p>Regarding my research method, I began by listening to the Symphony, using my ears to identify themes, sections, key changes, and other musical elements. Then I researched books and articles to gain a historical understanding of the piece. Finally, I applied a method of analysis I used before, identifying the form, themes, and keys, outlining the structure, establishing how the transitions of keys and sections are made and analysing how themes are built and used throughout the piece.</p>



<p>The feedback from my tutor proved pivotal in transforming what the tutor described as &#8220;a very good start to your analytical writing&#8221; into what I believe to be a well-structured and cohesive essay. Each comment offered new perspectives that hadn&#8217;t occurred to me before, which led to extensive revisions and additions to the essay.</p>



<p>The most important comment was to structure the essay around a central theme, accompanied by a suitable title and introduction. Although this advice seemed obvious upon reading it, it hadn&#8217;t initially occurred to me. Initially, I attempted to provide a comprehensive overview of the piece, resulting in numerous questions. With the help of my tutor, I selected one of those questions and reoriented my essay around the concept of Tone-painting or the &#8220;expression of a feeling.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another outcome of the feedback was that it gave me hints on what to focus on when researching. For example, the comment and question raised by my tutor about why the brief key change to a minor key in the development section sounded strange to me, led me to research more about the sonata form, which led me to find the book Elements of Sonata Theory. There I found the answer to this and other questions I had.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the feedback provided valuable guidance on areas to focus on during my research. For instance, the comment and question raised by my tutor regarding my strangeness when I found the brief key change to a minor key in the development section prompted further investigation into the sonata form, leading me to discover the book &#8220;Elements of Sonata Theory.&#8221; This reference provided answers to that particular question and others I had.</p>



<p>In conclusion, this assignment stands out as one of the most impactful learning experiences I have encountered thus far.</p>

		<span>Tone-painting or the &#8220;expression of a feeling&#8221;? Beethoven&#8217;s Sixth Symphony, First Movement</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>This essay explores the historical and musical aspects that help understand the nuanced connection between tone-painting and emotional expression in Beethoven&#8217;s Sixth Symphony, Op. 68 “Pastoral”. Through an analysis of the 1st movement of the Symphony, this essay aims to demonstrate how Beethoven masterfully blends these two concepts to create a musical composition that is both vibrant and sensitively emotive.</p>



<p>The Pastoral Symphony, composed between 1807 and 1808, falls within the middle of Beethoven&#8217;s second phase, which was influenced by the turbulent sociopolitical events of the Enlightenment era, personal struggles such as the onset of his deafness, and its cultural context as part of the transition from the Classical to Romantic music period.</p>



<p>Premiered in Vienna on December 22nd 1808, during a concert at which several of other major works by the composer were premiered including his 5th Symphony, the Pastoral Symphony is written for a typical orchestra of that period: piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones, timpani and strings (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1998a). </p>



<p>Since they both premiered at the same concert and were composed at around the same time, the contrast between the 5th Symphony and 6th Symphony is worth noting. The 5th is vigorous and varied, while the 6th is calm and repetitive, with programmatic titles illustrating rural life. Also, unlike the 5th Symphony, Beethoven gave his 6th an epithet: &#8220;Pastoral&#8221;.</p>



<p>In order to understand why Beethoven decided to use the Pastoral as the theme for this Symphony, one must consider the intersection of his personal history and the historical context in which he was creating. On the personal side, according to Allen (2017), Beethoven had a profound love for nature and often sought refuge from the bustle of urban life by retreating to the countryside. But in a historical context, Will (1994:166) states that the pastoral theme was the most common subject in programmatic symphonies during the Classical Period, and although there were earlier works such as Justin Heinrich Knecht&#8217;s 1784 symphony &#8220;Le portrait musical de la nature,&#8221; which shares a similar programmatic intent with Beethoven&#8217;s 6th Symphony, Beethoven might have found inspiration in Haydn&#8217;s great oratorios The Creation (1799) and The Seasons (1801) (Lockwood, 2015). However, in opposition to other programmatic symphonies, Beethoven intended this work to be “more the Expression of Feeling than Tone-Panting”.</p>



<p>Distinguishing between tone-painting and expression of feeling is crucial. According to Will (2002:130), expression involves imitating emotions, while painting involves replicating the sounds or movements of physical objects. The debate surrounding tone-painting in music gained significant attention in the late 18th century, leading to criticism from various English and German writers, including arguments such as &#8220;painting violates the true spirit of music, which ought to express the sentiments of feeling, not convey ideas of inanimate objects&#8221; (Sulzer 1792–94, II: 357 cited in Will, 2002:131).</p>



<ol start="6">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Two reviews from 1810, published in Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung (AmZ) and Zeitung für die elegante Welt, shed light on the debate surrounding tone-painting and expression of feeling in Beethoven&#8217;s Pastoral Symphony. While initially denouncing it as &#8220;the utmost in tastelessness,&#8221; the AmZ review later justifies Beethoven&#8217;s use of tone-painting to represent emotions, rather than physical objects.  (Will, 1994:158-160). Similarly, the review published in the Zeitung für die elegante Welt acknowledges that the symphony portrays emotions associated with the pastoral but it goes further to argue that it is more than a generic representation of such emotions. Rather, the scenes depicted are specific episodes from the composer&#8217;s own experiences in the countryside, imbued with his personal emotions. (Will, 1994:161).</p>



<p>Both reviews share a common acknowledgement of Beethoven&#8217;s utilization of tone-painting in his Pastoral Symphony, evident in instances like the storm in the 4th movement and the depiction of birds in the 2nd movement. However, they both consider Beethoven&#8217;s tone-painting to be of secondary significance, with the primary emphasis placed on its ability to convey emotions associated with the pastoral theme.</p>



<p>The pastoral style, as discussed by Adolf Sandberger and stated by Frank Eugene Kirby (1970:612-613), incorporates various elements such as &#8220;bird-call themes, hunting-horn themes, shepherds&#8217; pipes&#8230; and shepherds&#8217; calls&#8230;, country dances, &#8230; and&#8230; the bagpipe with its drone bass.&#8221; He also states that &#8220;the lilting dotted rhythm of the siciliano was frequently associated with the representation of the pastoral, as were flutes, oboes, and horns. Melodic motion in parallel thirds was also common&#8221;. </p>



<p>Robert Hatten (2004:83) highlights the historical precedent for the formal treatment of the pastoral theme through distinctive musical elements such as &#8220;greater consonance, simpler harmonies, pedal points, more-flowing melodic lines&#8221; and also rocking compound accompaniment, harmonic stasis, and melody in parallel thirds.</p>



<p>While each movement of Beethoven&#8217;s Symphony can be analyzed to understand how Beethoven used the music to convey the pastoral theme and elicit associated emotions, Lockwood (2015) defends that the 1st movement &#8220;exemplifies what Beethoven meant when he wrote “More the expression of feelings than tone-painting.”</p>



<p>The 1st movement of the Symphony, titled &#8220;Awakening of Cheerful Feelings upon Arrival in the Country,&#8221; serves as a joyful prelude, devoid of explicit programmatic features found in other movements. It features simple melodies and a light rhythm, with homophonic orchestration and primarily major keys, creating an atmosphere that transmits a cheerful pastoral quality. To depict the tranquillity of awakening in nature, Beethoven minimizes unexpected shifts, employs extensive repetitions, and only briefly uses a minor key.</p>

<p>The first movement follows the sonata form structure, as illustrated in Figure 1. Set in the key of F major, this choice holds a significant historical association with compositions inspired by nature, as noted by Geck (2017:105).</p>



<p>The introduction starts with a theme, that can be considered the first theme of the first subject area. This theme may have been inspired by a Serbian folk song called &#8220;Sirvonja&#8221; (Geck, 2017:107). The initial four bars come to a halt by means of the fermata over a sustained C major chord, dominant of F major.</p>

<p>In the first 4 bars, there are several musical elements that convey the pastoral theme: folk-like melody, drone bass, greater consonance, (briefly) melody in thirds and the key of F.</p>



<p>By bar 5, the second theme belonging to the first subject area is introduced in the violas, accompanied by the violins that employ pre-existing motific material from the first theme. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1400" width="324" height="106" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804.png 648w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804-300x98.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804-640x209.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The second theme of the first subject area played by the violas at bars 5-7</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within the initial 12 bars of the movement, Beethoven introduces the two principal themes that will serve as a significant guide throughout the piece, in addition to some hints of the motif&#8217;s development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1401" width="487" height="471" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24.png 974w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-300x290.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-768x743.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-640x619.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-960x928.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The first violins play a motific variation and the strings play the second theme of the first subject area at bars 8-12</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 16 comes an unexpected repetition on the strings. The first violins play the same rhythm as the second bar of the first theme, which lasts for 13 bars. The sole variation lies in the dynamics. This provides an indication of Beethoven&#8217;s approach to the symphony, characterized by repetitions and harmonic stasis, which is another feature of the pastoral theme (Hatten, 2004:98).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="265" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-1024x265.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1402" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-1024x265.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-300x78.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-768x199.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-1536x398.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-640x166.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-960x249.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33.png 1692w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The repetition on the violins at bars 17-22</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 29, the exposition section starts with a subdued presentation of the first theme initiated by the oboe, with the cellos and horns providing support. This theme is subsequently passed through the orchestra going through the clarinets and bassoons and finally with the strings. Notably, a sense of repetition is evident, as the same rhythm of the third bar of the first theme is repeated in the woodwinds and violins. However, the dynamics make all the difference in not making it seem stale.</p>

<p>At bar 46, Beethoven employs his first instance of tone-painting in the symphony, with the flutes performing a birdsong. This technique, however, is used sparingly throughout the first movement, with only one other occurrence observed during the recapitulation.</p>

<p>Suddenly, at bar 53, a change in texture occurs as the clarinets and bassoons, followed by the horns, introduce a triplet theme, played over the rhythm of the first bar of the first theme.   </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-1024x258.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1405" width="640" height="161" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-1024x258.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-300x76.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-768x194.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-640x161.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-960x242.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53.png 1364w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The horns play triples while the first violins play a variation of the first theme at bars 55-62</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 67, a traditional sonata change to the dominant key of C marks the beginning of the second subject area. The first theme is introduced by the first violin and subsequently transferred to all string instruments, followed by all woodwinds. This part brings a “rocking accompaniment” in the strings which is one of the pastoral’s general qualities, as stated before.</p>



<p>In bar 93, Beethoven introduces the second theme of the second subject area, which is characterized by a clear question-and-answer structure between the strings and woodwinds. The dynamics employed in this structure are noteworthy, as the question is played f while the answer is played p.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-1024x241.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1407" width="640" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-1024x241.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-300x71.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-768x181.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-640x151.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-960x226.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58.png 1375w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The oboe provides an answer to the first violins question at bars 93-99</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bar 111 marks the return of the triplets, providing a sense of a faster rhythm and subsequently leading to a prolonged repetition over a C pedal tone, another pastoral feature. The first two bars of the first theme of the first subject area are then repeated, which results in a substantial build-up of tension.</p>



<p>The development section starts at bar 151, marked by the modulation to Bb Major and the reappearance of the triplet rhythm, along with a slightly varied part of the second bar of the first theme of the first subject area. Notably, the development section is an unconventional deviation from the traditional expectation of dramatic and innovative contrast to the exposition. Instead, it features a static and repetitive section transposed into different keys. It actually reminded me of the Prelude in Wagner&#8217;s Das Rheingold, which builds in the intensity of dynamics and instrumentation while maintaining a constant motif.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-1024x631.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1409" width="512" height="316" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-1024x631.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-300x185.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-768x473.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-1536x946.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-640x394.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-960x591.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17.png 1734w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The strings repetition at bars 154-159</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bar 237 marks a key change to A Major where both the first and second themes from the first subject area make an appearance. The second theme is subsequently repeated, leading to a brief modulation to the minor key at bar 255, and finally to C Major at bar 263. While some might contend that the brief modulation to the minor key gives the development section the expected dramatism, it is, in fact, brief and it&#8217;s not repeated again.</p>



<p>Hepokoski and Darcy (2011:197) state that in major mode sonatas, it is common for the development sections to incorporate shifts towards more &#8220;dramatic&#8221; minor mode regions. However, it can be inferred that Beethoven intentionally avoided such expressive contrasts in the development of this movement, as it would have contradicted the serene and pastoral atmosphere he sought to create.</p>



<p>At bar 282, the music reaches a moment of pause, with only the violin playing a trill, suggesting the arrival of the recapitulation and the return of the first theme. However, the second theme from the first subject area reappears, leaving the listener uncertain about whether the development section has ended. There&#8217;s a sense of false start, through persistent repetition that builds in dynamics, until the first theme from the first subject is ultimately played by all the instruments of the orchestra featured in the movement at bar 312, thereby indicating the start of the recapitulation.</p>



<p>The recapitulation goes back, as expected in classical sonata form, to both subject areas but in the tonic key of F Major. Notably, Beethoven chooses to initiate this section with a ff dynamic, rather than following the softer dynamic of the exposition, thereby contradicting the expectations. In the final stages of the recapitulation, the dynamics and texture gradually decrease, leading to a reduced level of tension as the music moves towards the coda.</p>



<p>The coda starts in bar 418 with a modulation to Bb Major, the subdominant, which was common in Beethoven (Hepokoski and Darcy, 2011:285), before bringing it back to the tonic in measure 440. Beethoven utilizes dynamics that range from pp to ff, which creates a sense of uncertainty regarding the music&#8217;s conclusion, as he plays with the audience&#8217;s expectations. This leaves uncertainty about the end of the music until the orchestra ends playing in a soft and comforting F major chord. </p>



<p>Engel, in his brilliant insight on the matter, proposes the idea that &#8220;painting is expression.&#8221; (Will, 2002:136). This concept explores the harmonious alignment between our inner emotions and the external world, opening the door to an aesthetic validation of tone painting. This inherent duality implies that Beethoven could not effectively convey pastoral sentiments without employing some form of tone-painting. Particularly in the first movement, he skillfully incorporates musical techniques and occasional imitations of natural sounds, enabling listeners to recognize and appreciate the pastoral feelings within the composition. Ultimately, the true essence of Beethoven&#8217;s Sixth Symphony lies beyond an imitation of nature. Instead, it embodies a deep longing for the inner peace and serenity that nature invokes.</p>

<p>The 20th Century composer Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971), who himself was a connoisseur of music from previous periods, gave this quote as part of a series of lectures he gave at Harvard University in 1939. Drawing on your own thoughts and experience, and clearly referring to the four points below as well as developing ideas of your own, write 500 words discussing Stravinsky’s phrase from the point of view of rules in music. Try to explore your ideas as far as you can &#8211; especially the ones that are particularly important to you.</p>



<ul>
<li>Did you find strategies to cope with the rules outlined in this chapter?</li>

<p>The tutor&#8217;s feedback was generally positive, describing the reflection as engaging. I made minor revisions primarily focused on grammar and clarity, and also addressed the two points raised by the tutor.</p>



<p>Regarding the question of whether composers should learn all past techniques before pursuing their own ideas, I posed a further question on how education can strike the right balance between tradition and innovation. Should it even strive for that balance? It&#8217;s an open question that invites further exploration. Unfortunately, due to the word count limit, I couldn&#8217;t delve deeper into it.</p>



<p>Another valuable comment from the tutor related to the Church&#8217;s concerns about the potential consequences of unchecked musical creativity. I incorporated an answer to that within the paragraph discussing the Church&#8217;s control over music.</p>

</h2>



<p>Upon reading Stravinsky&#8217;s quote, I understood it quite intuitively. Due to my advertising background, most of the creative challenges I faced had constraints, so this subject is dear to me. In my experience, it was the &#8220;open challenges,&#8221; those without boundaries or limitations, that were the hardest to overcome.</p>



<p>Considering I could explore the theme more, the 500-word limit felt a bit short to me. There is a lot to discuss about rules&#8217; effectiveness, human bodies and instruments as extrinsic limitations, rules&#8217; roles in AI music composition, and if there is a right amount of restriction that promotes creativity. Nevertheless, I realized that a 500-word essay about constraints needs a constraint, so I summarized my main points.</p>



<p>Throughout this essay, the term &#8220;constraint&#8221; can take on many forms, including &#8220;rule,&#8221; &#8220;limit,&#8221; or &#8220;boundary.&#8221; Nonetheless, the underlying significance remains consistent— a set of both extrinsic and intrinsic inhibitions that an artist encounters while employing a creative medium.</p>

</h2>



<p>In this quote, Stravinsky was saying that all creativity revolves around solving problems (<meta charset="utf-8"></meta>Harnad et al., 2008). I believe he was arguing that for creativity to reach its full potential, there must be some tension that calls for resolution. Many artists from different eras and fields, including Mozart (Blanning, 2016), Frank Gehry (Hereld, 2013), and John Stweart (NPR, 2015), have defended the same position: Constraints and problems are essential for artists so that they can find solutions that will produce knowledge.</p>



<p>What artists develop within these limitations and rules depends on their goals and skills. Beethoven broke them (Page, 2019). Gesualdo bent them (Ross, 2011). John Cage created new ones (Savenko, 2021). However, one thing unites them all. Each of them mastered the rules before creating beyond them. This raises an intriguing question regarding how creative education can or should achieve an optimal balance between honouring tradition and fostering innovation.</p>



<p>Even when one considers musical genres, it becomes apparent that they too need rules. New musical genres are created when &#8220;socially accepted rules&#8221; are set over the traditional ones (Fabbri, 1980). There is always a cycle: established rules are mastered; then they are questioned; then new rules are developed.</p>



<p>This was evident when monophonic masses were replaced by polyphonic ones. It was a breaking of the rules of a single melodic line that led to the establishment of new rules by the Church at the Council of Trent (1545-1563) and mastered by Palestrina (Monson, 2002). During the 16th Century, these formal rules led to a strictness in compositional technique, which led to a controlled and accessible sound but also one that was predictable. This doesn&#8217;t mean that the rules were demeaning the music, but they were purely a necessity for the Church to standardize music during the Renaissance (Mock, 2017), which was a time of profound creative and cultural shifts. The Church feared heresy and deviation from established doctrine, social disorder and spiritual manipulation. To mitigate these risks, the Church imposed rules such as counterpoint to maintain authority and conformity.</p>



<p>To assist composers in learning these contrapuntal compositional techniques of the 16th Century, Johann-Joseph Fux authored in 1725 the Gradus ad Parnassum, during a time when composers refused &#8220;to be bound by any rules or principles&#8221; (Fux et al., 1971). They are known as species counterpoint and have been a part of the learning of Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn (Norman, nd) and my own learning as well.</p>



<p>To learn and implement these rules, I found it most helpful to understand the &#8220;why&#8221; behind them. For example, understanding why consecutive fifths and octaves, and unison passages can render the music too dull and boring makes it easier to remember than simply stating &#8220;do not use successive fifths and octaves, or unison passages&#8221;. As well as this, I relied on the progressive learning method, where one learns by doing (Kennedy, 2019). This made learning easier by increasing the difficulty one step at a time and letting my mind become accustomed to the rules as I progressed.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the rules and constraints proved to be beneficial to me, as they helped me learn different harmonization and melodic concepts, and proved effective since I was able to compose much faster than I would without them. They also proved useful in helping me become more creative as I learned to solve some musical problems and maybe even come up with new ones in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Upon watching an Instagram Reel by David Asher Brown on Venezuelan merengue and its unique 5/8 rhythm, I decided to explore one of the genre&#8217;s most renowned compositions, Acidito. The song was composed by Adelis Fréitez and has been popularized by several singers and bands. </p>



<p>Cecilia Todd Vallenilla is a well-known Venezuelan musician, recognized for her performances of traditional Venezuelan folk music. She is especially skilled in playing the cuatro, which she uses to accompany herself in performances both within Venezuela and abroad.</p>

<p>Upon close listening, it became clear that the 5/8 rhythm of Venezuelan merengue, as described by David Asher Brown, feels natural without any apparent sense of strain. The natural quality of this rhythmic structure may be attributed to the tempo at which it is played.</p>



<p>After looking at the bass score, I realized that it consists of a two-quaver and one-crotchet rhythm. This raises the question of where the accent falls, whether it is on the first or the fifth beat. Based on the position of the break and the melodic leap, it appears that the accent may be on the fifth beat, although I may not be entirely right.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It has been widely accepted since Lenz&#8217;s 1852 Beethoven biography that his musical journey can be distinguished into&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It has been widely accepted since Lenz&#8217;s 1852 Beethoven biography that his musical journey can be distinguished into three distinct phases. In the first phase (1782-1802), he imitated Mozart and Haydn to fit the aesthetic of the time. The second phase (1803-1812) marked a period of stylistic evolution and the creation of his third to eighth symphonies. The third and final phase began around 1813 and involved experimentation with innovative sonorities. (Rogers, 1919).</p>



<p>The Pastoral Symphony, composed between 1807 and 1808, falls within the middle of Beethoven&#8217;s second phase, which was heavily influenced by the events explained in more detail <a href="./../../../research-point-5-0/index.html" data-type="post" data-id="1317">here</a>, such as artistic innovations, political revolutions, wars, but also personal struggles such as the onset of his deafness. </p>



<p>Premiered in Vienna, Austria, on December 22nd, 1808, during a concert at which several of his works were premiered, including his 5th Symphony, the Pastoral Symphony is written for a typical orchestra of that period: piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones, timpani and strings (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1998a). </p>



<p>Since they both premiered at the same concert and were composed at around the same time, the contrast between Symphony No. 5 and Symphony No. 6 is a remarkable aspect worth noting. No. 5 is vigorous and varied, while No. 6 is calm and pastoral, with programmatic titles illustrating rural life as a refuge. Was this contrast deliberate on Beethoven&#8217;s part? Why did he choose to compose a programmatic symphony? And why a pastoral theme?</p>



<p>In order to answer the last question, one must consider the intersection of his personal history and the historical context in which he was creating. On the personal side, according to Allen (2017), Beethoven had a profound love for nature and often sought refuge from the bustle of urban life by retreating to the countryside. But in a historical context, Will (1994:166) analyses, the pastoral theme was the most common subject in programmatic symphonies during the Classical Period, and Beethoven might have found inspiration in earlier works such as Justin Heinrich Knecht&#8217;s 1784 symphony &#8220;Le portrait musical de la nature,&#8221; which shares a similar programmatic intent with Beethoven&#8217;s 6th Symphony. However, in opposition to other programmatic symphonies, Beethoven intended this work to be “more the Expression of Feeling than Tone-Panting”.</p>



<p>The question of tone-painting in Beethoven&#8217;s Pastoral Symphony has sparked much debate and was subject to extensive criticism in two reviews in 1810, published in AMZ 12 and Zeitung für die elegante Welt 10. These reviews provide valuable insights into the contemporary perception of tone-painting. While initially denouncing it as &#8220;the utmost in tastelessness,&#8221; the AMZ review later justifies Beethoven&#8217;s use of tone-painting to represent emotions, rather than physical objects. The continues stating that theorists of expression saw superficiality as one of the greatest faults of tone-painting (Will, 1994:158-160).</p>



<p>The review published in Zeitung provides further insight into the perception of the Pastoral Symphony&#8217;s tone-painting. The reviewer acknowledges that the symphony portrays emotions associated with the pastoral but goes on to argue that it is more than a generic representation of such emotions. Rather, the scenes depicted are specific episodes from the composer&#8217;s own experiences in the countryside, imbued with his personal emotions. Consequently, the reviewer deems tone-painting to be of secondary importance, with the focus instead on the power of the composer&#8217;s personality (Will, 1994:161).</p>



<p>In my opinion, the reviews made a clear effort to dismiss tone-painting and focus on how Beethoven conveyed emotions (personal or generic) revealing that both this symphony and the cultural environment of its time were undergoing a discernible transition from the classicist period to the romantic era, exhibiting traits and preferences that spanned both styles. This is a reminder that such transitions are not time-bound but rather an organic and gradual process marked by overlaps. </p>



<p>Ultimately, this raises questions that remained unresolved in my research. Specifically, as Beethoven transitioned from the patronage system to a broader audience-based system, did he prioritize the opinions of critics with regard to tone-painting? Additionally, what was his stance regarding the proposition that tone-painting was a manifestation of tastelessness? Could this potentially explain why this is his only symphony?</p>



<h5 id="6th-symphony-movements" class="wp-block-heading">6th Symphony Movements</h5>



<p>Pastoral Symphony&#8217;s first movement, &#8220;Awakening of Cheerful Feelings upon Arrival in the Country,&#8221; serves as a joyful prelude. It features simple melodies and light rhythm, with homophonic orchestration and primarily major keys. Beethoven minimizes unexpected shifts by repeating motifs and only briefly uses a minor key.</p>



<p>The second movement, titled &#8220;Scene by the Brook,&#8221; is a serene and peaceful composition that is free of the typical Germanic tension often associated with Beethoven&#8217;s music. The movement begins with a lilting rhythmic motion that is said to sound like the flowing of a brook.</p>



<p>The third movement, titled &#8220;Merry Gathering of the Country Folk,&#8221; is a Scherzo in ABA form, with the main theme having a rustic feel. The trio section has a particularly country dance feel, with a constant emphasis on the downbeat of each bar. The movement ends with a curtailed return to the main theme, followed by a faster presto section and a transition into the next movement.</p>



<p>The fourth movement, entitled &#8220;Thunderstorm,&#8221; is a dramatic and tension-filled episode that deviates from the overall tranquil character of the symphony. The storm is portrayed through the depiction of thunder and thunderclaps, and the movement ultimately subsides, coinciding with the gradual fading of the storm.</p>



<p>Continuing without interruption, the fifth and final movement of the symphony is entitled &#8220;Shepherd&#8217;s Song, happy and thankful feelings after the storm.&#8221; It is a delightful and evocative music that utilizes a gentle and rhythmic theme that is repeated throughout the rondo form of the movement. The movement ends with a quiet and prayerful coda as if wishing farewell to the countryside before returning to the city.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The first movement of the composition is in the sonata form, as exemplified in Figure 1. The introduction starts with a theme, that can be considered the first theme of the first subject area. The initial four bars come to a halt by means of the fermata over a sustained C major chord, dominant of F major.</p>

<p>By bar 5, the second theme belonging to the first subject area is introduced in the violas, accompanied by the violins that employ pre-existing motific material from the first theme. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1400" width="486" height="159" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804.png 648w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804-300x98.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804-640x209.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The second theme of the first subject area played by the violas at bars 5-7</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within the initial 12 bars of the movement, Beethoven introduces the two principal themes that will serve as a significant guide throughout the piece, in addition to some hints of the motif&#8217;s development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1401" width="487" height="471" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24.png 974w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-300x290.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-768x743.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-640x619.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-960x928.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The first violins play a motific variation and the strings play the second theme of the first subject area at bars 8-12</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 16 comes an unexpected repetition on the strings. The first violins play the same rhythm as the second bar of the first theme, which lasts for 13 bars. The sole variation lies in the dynamics. This provides an indication of Beethoven&#8217;s approach to the symphony, characterized by repetitions, reutilization of motific material and a marked emphasis on dynamics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="265" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-1024x265.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1402" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-1024x265.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-300x78.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-768x199.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-1536x398.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-640x166.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-960x249.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33.png 1692w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The repetition on the violins at bars 17-22</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 29, the exposition section starts with a subdued presentation of the first theme initiated by the oboe, with the cellos and horns providing support. This theme is subsequently passed through the orchestra going through the clarinets and bassoons and finally with the strings. Notably, a sense of repetition is evident, as the same rhythm of the third bar of the first theme is repeated in the woodwinds and violins. However, the dynamics make all the difference in not making it seem stale.</p>

<p>At bar 46, Beethoven employs his first instance of tone-painting in the symphony, with the flutes performing a birdsong. This technique, however, is used sparingly throughout the first movement, with only one other occurrence observed during the recapitulation. This brings back the question of Beethoven&#8217;s intention with respect to tone painting. Was he conflicted between differing views on the technique, or was he experimenting with it in a playful or provocative manner, perhaps testing the reactions of audiences and critics?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1404" width="555" height="107" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05.png 740w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05-300x58.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05-640x123.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Birdsong on the flutes at bars 46-48</figcaption></figure>



<p>Suddenly, at bar 53, a change in texture occurs as the clarinets and bassoons, followed by the horns, introduce a triplet theme, played over the rhythm of the first bar of the first theme. Once again, Beethoven employs repetition to great effect, inducing heightened tension as the triplet motif interrupts the expected continuation of the primary theme.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-1024x258.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1405" width="640" height="161" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-1024x258.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-300x76.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-768x194.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-640x161.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-960x242.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53.png 1364w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The horns play triples while the first violins play a variation of the first theme at bars 55-62</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 67, a traditional sonata change to the dominant key of C marks the beginning of the second subject area. The first theme is introduced by the first violin and subsequently transferred to all string instruments, followed by all woodwinds. Beethoven employs the same technique of repeating the theme, marked by a dynamic and instrumental buildup.</p>



<p>At bar 93, Beethoven introduces the second theme of the second subject area, which is characterized by a clear question-and-answer structure between the strings and woodwinds. The dynamics employed in this structure are noteworthy, as the question is played f while the answer is played p.</p>

<p>Bar 111 marks the return of the triplets, providing a sense of a faster rhythm and subsequently leading to a prolonged repetition over a C pedal tone. The first two bars of the first theme of the first subject area are then repeated, which results in a substantial buildup of tension.</p>



<p>Based on my analysis, the development section starts at bar 151, marked by the modulation to Bb Major and the reappearance of the triplet rhythm, along with a slightly varied part of the second bar of the first theme of the first subject area. Notably, the development section is an unconventional deviation from the traditional expectation of dramatic and innovative contrast to the exposition. Instead, it features a static and repetitive section transposed into different keys. It actually reminded me of the Prelude in Wagner&#8217;s Das Rheingold, which builds in the intensity of dynamics and instrumentation while maintaining a constant motif.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-1024x631.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1409" width="512" height="316" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-1024x631.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-300x185.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-768x473.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-1536x946.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-640x394.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-960x591.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17.png 1734w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The strings repetition at bars 154-159</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bar 237 marks a key change to A Major where both the first and second themes from the first subject area make an appearance. The second theme is subsequently repeated, leading to a brief modulation to the minor key at bar 255, and finally to C Major at bar 263. While some might contend that the brief modulation to the minor key gives the development section the expected dramatism, it is, in fact, brief and it&#8217;s not repeated again.</p>



<p>At bar 282, the music reaches a moment of pause, with only the violin playing a trill, suggesting the arrival of the recapitulation and the return of the first theme. However, the second theme from the first subject area reappears, leaving the listener uncertain about whether the development section has ended. There&#8217;s a sense of false start, through persistent repetition that builds in dynamics, until the first theme from the first subject is ultimately played by all the instruments of the orchestra featured in the movement at bar 312, thereby indicating the start of the recapitulation.</p>



<p>The recapitulation goes back, as expected by classical sonata form, to both subject areas but in the tonic key of F Major. Notably, Beethoven chooses to initiate this section with a ff dynamic, rather than following the softer dynamic of the exposition, thereby contradicting the expectations. In the final stages of the recapitulation, the dynamics and texture gradually decrease, leading to a reduced level of tension as the music moves towards the coda.</p>



<p>The coda starts in bar 418 with a modulation to Bb Major, which I found unexpected. However, this modulation is brief, as it modulates back to F Major in measure 440. Beethoven utilizes dynamics that range from pp to ff, which creates a sense of uncertainty regarding the music&#8217;s conclusion, as he plays with the audience&#8217;s expectations. This leaves uncertainty about the end of the music until the orchestra ends playing.</p>



<p>After my research and analysis, my opinion is that Beethoven found himself composing this Symphony in times of change, where he was balancing his classical influences with a desire to establish himself as a disruptive composer and build the pavement for the romantic era. Beethoven&#8217;s use of traditional sonata form, such as the question/answer construction and the modulations in the development section, reflect his attachment to the classical principles of order and balance, while his exploration of static harmony for long periods and the repetition of a motif while exploring dynamics and timbres demonstrates his forward-thinking approach.</p>



<p>Additionally, Beethoven was also grappling with the concept of tone-painting and trying to appeal to a broader audience, which may have influenced his decision to use the natural world as a thematic focus in this symphony. Furthermore, the composer&#8217;s personal struggles with increasing deafness likely added a layer of complexity to his creative process and may have impacted his artistic choices in this work. </p>

<p>Although not typically drawn to classical guitar compositions, I discovered the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos&#8217; (1887-1957) 12 Études for Guitar and decided to listen to it.</p>



<p>Heitor Villa-Lobos is widely regarded as one of the foremost composers of Latin American music in the 20th century. His work is notable for its unique synthesis of Western classical music and traditional Brazilian folk songs and rhythms. Among his many notable works are the Etudes, composed in 1928 and dedicated to the renowned guitarist Andres Segovia. Alongside their didactic function, these pieces are often featured in live performances due to their musical richness and technical demands.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Heitor Villa-lobos - 12 Études for Guitar (Score video)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JP8R7JBu_UM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>A few of the études caught my attention.</p>



<p>Study No. 1, employs the technique of right-hand arpeggio. The formula is fixed, interrupted only in measures 23-24. The Study can be divided into three sections: the first section goes until measure 11, which is characterized by stability in the harmony. The second section runs from measure 12 to measure 22, where the arpeggios move down the scale by step, with a pedal E bass note. The third section covers measures 23 to 33, where the range of the notes is expanded. The study was symmetrically constructed with sections of 11 measures. The beauty of this piece lies in the cyclical repetition of each bar, which effectively generates a sense of tension and release.</p>



<p>Study No. 4 is centred on the continuous repetition of chords in the right hand while extensively exploring the harmonic capabilities of the guitar. I hear in these chords elements that anticipate the emergence of Brazilian popular music and bossa nova in the years following its composition.</p>



<p>Study No. 10 is characterized by a range of idiomatic resources and technical challenges, including the use of open strings as pedal notes and ornamental techniques for accompanying open strings. The first 20 bars of the piece are constructed around a fixed position of the left hand, which ascends chromatically, creating a sense of mounting tension. I believe this section showcases Villa-Lobos&#8217; skilful use of harmonic and melodic devices to create a dynamic and engaging piece of music.</p>

<p>Beethoven’s String Quartet Op. 18, No. 1 is the first of six quartets that were published together in 1801, known as the Op. 18 quartets. These quartets were written during Beethoven&#8217;s early period, and they represent a transition from the classical style of Haydn and Mozart to Beethoven&#8217;s unique and innovative approach to composition.</p>



<p>This is a composition that greatly impressed me due to its spirited and multifaceted character, full of energy, pathos, and even elements of humour, with abrupt pauses and deceptive endings. The first movement is marked by a playful and vigorous tone, gravitating around the opening motive and employing diverse variations of it throughout the piece. The second movement, by contrast, evokes a more serious and intense atmosphere, that some scholars suggest was inspired by the burial scene in Romeo and Juliet. The third movement, in turn, features a sprightly Scherzo and Trio. Finally, the Allegro finale provides an entertaining and engaging end to the composition, employing silence strategically to evoke a sense of surprise and delight among the audience.</p>



<p>The quartet features a balanced distribution of roles among the instruments. The first violin carries the primary melodic lines, while the other instruments have some supportive role, even though they play monophonically sometime. Indeed, a dynamic interplay exists among the instruments, with the primary melody traversing through all parts.</p>



<p>In my experience, some minor alterations were necessary when arranging a string quartet for solo piano, such as adjusting the harmonies to suit the pianists&#8217; hand limitations. However, the essential character of the quartet can still be captured by a piano, even though it can never catch the dynamic strength of four instruments. I think this is more noticeable in passages with sforzando, like the one in bar 22.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Beatles&#8217; &#8220;Here, There and Everywhere&#8221; is a lyrical and melodic love song, and according to Paul McCartney&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Beatles&#8217; &#8220;Here, There and Everywhere&#8221; is a lyrical and melodic love song, and according to Paul McCartney in the McCartney 1, 2, 3 documentary, it is his favourite melody he composed. Despite its compelling melody, it is strange, for me, that it&#8217;s not as well-known as other Beatles love songs such as &#8220;Something&#8221; or &#8220;And I Love Her.&#8221; Nevertheless, the explicit lyrics leave no room for doubt that the singer wants the lover to be present at all times and everywhere, which makes the theme of the song relatable and impactful.</p>



<p>The structure of the song is intriguing because there is ambiguity about which parts serve as the verse or chorus. There is no melodic and harmonic division that lets the listener distinguish which one serves as chorus or verse. Instead, it is easier to structure the song as Introduction &#8211; A &#8211; B &#8211; A &#8211; B &#8211; A.</p>



<p>Looking closer at the harmony, it is remarkable that the song has two modulations, which is uncommon in pop music, especially considering the song&#8217;s brief 2:24 minute runtime. The song is in the key of G major, and the first modulation happens in the A section, where the music shifts to the relative minor, E, with an F#m7 chord followed by a B major chord, and then moves to E minor chord shifting back to the key of G major.</p>



<p>The other modulation occurs in the B section, where the song modulates to Bb major. This is a relatively dramatic shift, but it is attenuated with preparation at the end of the A section, where the melody sings a Bb note before moving to the B section.</p>



<p>The melody is what I like the most about this music, especially the leap that first appears at bar 5. Upon closer inspection, this leap is similar to SZA&#8217;s &#8220;Kill Bill&#8221; melody (I wrote about it here), which employs an upward preparation followed by a descent with a longer duration. This is a good melodic technique that contributes to the song&#8217;s appeal.</p>

<p>The vocal harmonies in the song are simple and effective. According to the producer George Martin, &#8220;the boys&#8221; hummed basic triads behind the melody, resulting in moving block harmonies.</p>



<p>The song&#8217;s arrangement never seems to settle, similar to the Beach Boys&#8217; &#8220;God Only Knows,&#8221; which was, in fact, an inspiration for McCartney when he wrote, &#8220;Here, There and Everywhere.&#8221;</p>



<p>In conclusion, &#8220;Here, There and Everywhere&#8221;, for me, is a great example of a love song that demonstrates mastery of melody and harmony, but also simplicity. It is an excellent example of pop music that uses modulation effectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In Part 5 of this unit, we further explore our comprehension of the Classical Era by examining music on various levels that comprise it. Initially, we obtained a general understanding of the social, political, economic, and cultural circumstances of the era and the influence of significant historical events on this movement. This was a beneficial starting point in comprehending the background and customs of the Classical composers, as well as the innovations they introduced.</p>



<p>Regarding the music itself, the analysis process was usually very similar: listening to the piece following the score, adding annotations to key moments such as themes, sections and modulations, and passages of special textural and sonic interest.</p>



<p>During this particular part, the study of Sonata form held great significance as it allowed me to comprehend how a rigid structure could shape a musical piece or movement. Furthermore, it helped me understand how it offered the composers the flexibility to deviate from the established norms and infuse their own creativity. A prime example of this is Mozart&#8217;s Sonata No.15 in C major for Pianoforte, where he subtly alters the recapitulation by beginning it in the Dominant Key instead of the expected Tonic. Alternatively, some composers such as Bartók, choose to utilize only the fundamental elements of the Sonata form, as demonstrated in the example we analyzed.</p>



<p>Picking on this contrast between Mozart, Haydn and Bartók, I found also helpful to contrast compositions from different eras to identify their unique stylistic features and better appreciate their creative innovations. </p>



<p>Given that the Sonata form embodies the fundamental principles of classicism, emphasizing balance and elegance, it was expected to see that these composers followed these rigid structures. But analysis of the pieces brought to the surface how they crafted remarkable and captivating pieces that respected the structural conventions of the form they employed, while still managing to surprise and delight the listener.</p>



<p>One additional finding after going through different analyses of pieces of this era was that tonal relationships and thematic development were important features of classical works.</p>



<p>Personally, I find the process of &#8220;unpacking&#8221; a composition to be simultaneously fascinating and exhausting. On the one hand, it offers a privileged behind-the-scenes look at the composition, as if one were unravelling the very mind of the composer, as Cook (1987) aptly notes. On the other hand, this process can be time-consuming and arduous, in stark contrast to the simple act of listening to and experiencing a piece. It&#8217;s not uncommon to spend days analyzing a mere 20-minute composition, only to realize that there is still much left to uncover. Nonetheless, this meticulous approach often leads to a newfound appreciation and respect for a work that might have initially appeared less complex than it truly is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Steve Reich (born October 3, 1936,&nbsp;New York, U.S.)  is one of the greatest living composers. He is considered one of the greatest contributors to the minimalist music movement with a style based on repetitive and rhythmic patterns. His compositions often feature a limited number of instruments.</p>



<p>In 1988, Steve Reich created &#8220;Different Trains,&#8221; a three-part composition featuring a string quartet and excerpts from audio recordings. This highly personal work draws inspiration from Reich&#8217;s recollections of his Jewish upbringing in the United States and his train voyages across the country. The piece&#8217;s themes are further contextualized by the vastly different connotations associated with train travel during World War II in Europe, where the transportation of Jews took on an entirely different significance.</p>



<p>The pioneering aspect of the composition lies in its integration of prerecorded sounds with a live string quartet. Sourced from a range of records featuring diverse train sounds and spoken-word samples, including those from Holocaust survivors, this unique blend of live performance and recorded sounds lend a layer of profundity and authenticity to the piece. In particular, the first movement stands out for its complete fusion of the strings and recordings, with the latter serving as the motivic ideas that the strings then elaborate upon. This creative approach, innovative for its time, elevates &#8220;Different Trains&#8221; to a remarkable work of art.</p>



<p>Across all three movements, a continuous repetition of sounds and patterns interlock and build upon one another, creating a rich and almost hypnotic soundscape. While this reinforces the rhythmic motion of a train, it also enables the listener to become fully immersed in the 30-minute journey of an industrialized landscape, transitioning into haunting melodies and ultimately concluding on a hopeful note. </p>



<p>While I was unable to discern any conventional chord progressions commonly found in classical string quartets, I observed a pronounced typical rhythmic texture primarily conveyed through the strings. In my opinion, this rhythmic quality injects the composition with a sense of emotion, motion, and intrigue, preventing it from succumbing to monotony and repetitiveness.</p>



<p>In my view, the most fascinating aspect of &#8220;Different Trains&#8221; lies in its harmonious melding of realism and emotion. The inclusion of train whistles and station sounds fosters a vivid and evocative soundscape, while the voices infused throughout the piece infuse a human element that heightens the profound emotional depth already conveyed through the strings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cook (1987) raises a compelling argument regarding analysing music, which resonated with me in the few analysis I made during this course: how intimate you become with the music the more time you spend analysing it as if you&#8217;re unravelling the very mind of the composer. However, Cook also points out that to get that intimacy with the piece and closeness with the composer, one must know what questions to ask during an analysis. And here&#8217;s where analytical methods are important.</p>



<p>Musical analysis can cover a spectrum of considerations such as the social, historical and aesthetic factors and expressive content, as well as more formal analysis concerned to form, melodic, harmonic and rhythmic content.</p>



<p>One of the most recognized formal analyses was created by Heinrich Schenker in the years before the second world war and developed ever since. Cook refers to it as the &#8220;Schenkerian Analysis&#8221; that works very well with tonal music. Schenkerian theory proposes that music is made up of various layers: the ursatz or fundamental structure, which is a two-voice structure that forms the basis for an analytical approach to examine the complexities of a piece; the middle ground which consists of inter-relating the actual foreground of the music with the imaginary voices of the background (Cook, 1987); the foreground or surface level. </p>

The 123’s of Schenkerian Analysis</em> (no date). Available at: https://academic.udayton.edu/PhillipMagnuson/soundpatterns/perspec/123graphing.html.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another field of analysis is the semiotic one, which Jean-Jacques Nattiez is a proponent, does not concern itself with too much the diatonic framework, but rather with the repetition of units and analyzing how they used throughout the piece. </p>



<p>There is also the Set Theory, developed by Milton Babbitt and later Allen Forte. It can be used on any kind of music, including atonal music. Set theory primarily deals with pitch classes, which refer to the &#8220;character&#8221; of a pitch. This analytical approach that allows for the description of all pitch and interval class collections, without relying on the traditional triadic or tonal functions. The result is a reduction in the total number of sets, making the process more manageable and accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This String Quartet got my attention right at the beginning. The opening is a slow and haunting Adagio introduction, which features discordant harmonies that create a sense of tension and unease. The pulsating cello descends chromatically leaving a harmonic ambiguity that surprised me. I wasn&#8217;t expecting this kind of introduction by Mozart. The other strings keep playing colliding notes, while the dynamics keep going from p to f and back to p. These 22 bars of the Adagio create a stark contrast with the subsequent Allegro movement, which is characterized by its lively and playful nature.</p>



<p>This string quartet in C major was composed in 1785 and is part of the set of six quartets composed between 1782 and 1785 that he dedicated to Joseph Haydn. This introduction was so innovative and disruptive for its time that it received mixed reviews from critics, publishers and players.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A string quartet is generally composed of two violins, a viola and one cello and is typically viewed&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A string quartet is generally composed of two violins, a viola and one cello and is typically viewed as a genre of music that is like a conversation. In fact, in a letter from 1829, addressed to the composer Carl Friedrich Zelter, Goethe compared the string quartet to &#8220;a stimulating conversation between four intelligent people&#8221; and saw in it &#8220;the most comprehensible of instrumental music genres.&#8221; </p>



<p>The evolution of the string quartet is not entirely clear, although there seems to be an inclination towards the divertimento genre and the Baroque Trio Sonata as possible sources of influence. What is clear is that the string quartet grew in popularity due to its low cost and ease of rehearsal. It was also the ideal size for small home gatherings and allowed for more freedom in composing. In addition to its practicality, the string quartet is also thought to have reflected the aesthetic values of the Enlightenment era: its intimate conversation with equal participation of all voices, as well as its capacity to convey a deep musical thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although other composers such as Holzbauer, Wagenseil, Allegri, and Scarlatti had explored the string quartet, it is Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) who is widely regarded as &#8220;the father of the string quartet.&#8221; While he did not invent the genre, he made the most significant contributions to defining it, composing a total of 68 quartets. Initially, the quartets he wrote were primarily centred on the first violin, with the viola and cello doubling the melody. However, over time, he evolved the texture to be more uniform in terms of the instruments&#8217; importance. Furthermore, he also refined the form, initially starting with five movements, like the divertimento genre, but later settling on four movements, with the first one in sonata form.</p>



<p>Mozart was another influential composer who helped develop the string quartet, notably with the six pieces dedicated to Haydn and the three dedicated to Frederick William II of Prussia. These quartets are regarded as mature works and reflect the style established by Haydn.</p>



<p>Beethoven was influenced by the work of Haydn and Mozart. While his first six quartets, Op.18 (1798–1800), adhered to the established string quartet framework, his three Razumovsky quartets, Opus 59 (1806), are regarded as reflecting his transition towards Romanticism and are widely considered to be among his finest works.</p>



<p>In the 19th century, some composers moved away from classical forms, like Liszt, Wagner, and Richard Strauss, resulting in a decrease in quartet composition. However, Antonín Dvořák wrote 14 quartets. The quartet regained popularity among composers during the Modern era, playing a key role in the works of Debussy, Ravel, Schoenberg, Bartók, and Shostakovich. In the late 20th century the genre still has some composers interested in developing it, such as Karlheinz Stockhausen&#8217;s Helikopter-Quartett composed in 1992-93. Composers such as Riley, Glass, Reich and John Adams produced string quartets in their own style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The texture of the main theme can be seen as a four-part counterpoint as each instrument has its own independent line. However, when listening to this section, one perceives a distinct melody on the first violin supported by the accompaniment, especially in the viola and the cello.</p>



<p>In the first variation, the second violin plays the melody while the first violin plays an arpeggiated figure. I&#8217;m not sure if this is considered a two-part counterpoint because there is no distinct melody on the first violin. Nonetheless, the first violin&#8217;s role feels more like an accompaniment. Upon listening to this variation, one can perceive that both instruments are connected, especially in bar 36 when both instruments reach their climax at the same time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="343" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-1024x343.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1358" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-1024x343.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-300x101.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-768x257.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-1536x515.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-640x214.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18-960x322.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-11.34.18.png 1916w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bars 35-37</figcaption></figure>



<p>The second variation has a richer texture. The cello takes on the primary melody, while the second violin initially moves homophonically with the cello before gradually diverging and converging with the first violin. The first violin features a distinct melody that starts out thin and gradually becomes denser as the variation progresses. Meanwhile, The viola has a simple accompaniment part. This variation can be seen as a three-part counterpoint.</p>



<p>The third variation presents a more intricate texture and a chromatic sound. The viola takes on the primary melody, while the two violins play their own distinct melodies. The cello remains silent for eight bars, but upon entering, it creates an intensely chromatic feeling in bars 69-71, perhaps due to its bass sound serving as the foundation for the chords. This variation appears to have a four-part counterpoint, featuring highly independent lines. However, there are moments where the voices seem to be rhythmically coordinated.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="336" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-1024x336.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1362" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-1024x336.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-300x98.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-768x252.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-1536x504.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-640x210.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-960x315.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30-1920x632.png 1920w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.21.30.png 1928w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bars 69-71</figcaption></figure>



<p>The final variation returns to the simplicity of the first variations. The main melody is played by the first violin, and the other voices serve to support it while retaining their unique character. It may not necessarily qualify as a definitive four-part counterpoint. The texture is much more compact compared to the previous variation, and it becomes particularly crisp in bars 91-97, where all instruments play in their upper register.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="370" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-1024x370.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1361" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-1024x370.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-300x108.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-768x278.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-1536x555.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-2048x741.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-640x231.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42-960x347.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-12.19.42.png 2428w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bars 92-95</figcaption></figure>



<p>The main difference between the first and second movements is that in the latter the texture shifts from one variation to the next, but remains constant within each individual variation. In the first movement, the texture continuously changes without a discernible pattern or structure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I find investigations such as the one conducted on Haydn&#8217;s Emperor to be extremely useful, particularly when seeking to bridge the gap between the emotional and rational aspects of classical music. When casually listening to a piece, we can often become consumed by the emotions it evokes, without giving much thought to how they are conveyed. However, investigating the structure and development of a composition, as well as the techniques used by the composer, provides us with a more rational understanding of the music. Through investigation, we can better appreciate the intricate and intentional ways in which the music is made to bring out specific emotional responses and enhance our overall listening experience.</p>



<p>Through this investigation, I gained a deeper understanding of the Sonata form and how it can be developed with different themes. I also gained a new understanding of the techniques used by composers to create a musical journey that navigates from the home key to a distant key and back again. This exploration reminded me that musical forms are not rigid structures, but rather malleable frameworks that composers can use as they see fit, much like Bartók did.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I found the investigative approach to be extremely useful, as it provided me with a structured framework for future analysis. Starting with a broad perspective and progressively digging into specific details:</p>



<ul>
<li>Identify the form</li>



<li>Identify themes and keys</li>



<li>Outline the structure</li>



<li>Establish how the transitions of keys and sections are made</li>



<li>Analyse how themes are built and used throughout the piece</li>
</ul>



<p>One thing that is missing from this analysis is to consider the broader musical landscape at the time of composition, such as the prevailing trends and techniques used by other composers. By understanding the broader musical context, we can better appreciate what makes a piece unique and significant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The piece begins in C major and the first four bars present the themes and are very homogenous in terms of rhythm between the instruments. This and the perfect cadences convey a sense of comfort and stability</p>



<p>The key continues to be C major until bar 13, where the first theme modulates. This brings a confusing mood to the piece, where the centre of tonality seems to be lost. I get the sense that it moves to E, before having the pedal note in D. This pedal tone creates a lot of tension, before establishing the new key.</p>



<p>In the second subject area, the piece moves to the secondary dominant key of G. This feels fresh but still in a bright mood. However, the piece momentarily shifts to G minor at bar 29, creating an edgy and uncertain mood.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Béla Bartók (1881 &#8211; 1945) was a Hungarian composer, and one of the most influential figures in 20th-century music. His pieces are known for their extensive chromaticism and novel rhythms. He is known for collecting and studying authentic Hungarian folk music and incorporating them into his music. He wrote six string quartets which were among his most impressive achievements, being the fourth, the most celebrated.</p>



<p>The String Quartet No.4 has five movements that are written symmetrically. It contains two sets of identical movements with a middle movement which is the central point of the quartet. Here is Bartók explaining it:</p>



<p>&#8220;The work is in five movements; their character corresponds to Classical sonata form. The slow movement is the kernel of the work; the other movements are, as it were, arranged in layers around it. Movement IV is a free variation of II, and I and V have the same thematic material; that is, around the kernel (Movement III), metaphorically speaking, I and V are the outer, II and IV the inner layers.&#8221; (Keller, 2011).</p>



<p>Although Bartók suggests that the nature of the first and final movements corresponds with that of the Classical sonata form, I believe that he merely employed the concept of the sonata form and utilized it liberally as a framework for his composition, without adhering rigorously to its conventions. Distinct motifs are present in the quartet, rather than explicitly articulated themes as found in the sonatas of Beethoven or Haydn. These motific ideas tend to appear for a very short time and disappear quickly. This reminds me of Debussy.</p>



<p>Upon listening to this piece for the first time, I found it much harder to distinguish the sonata sections, in contrast to Haydn&#8217;s quartet, wherein such segments were easily discernible. However, after reading the score and watching Andreyev&#8217;s analysis, I was able to understand the structure of the piece, the division of the sections, and the appearance of each motif.<br></p>



<p>When listening to the entire movement, I found it to be incredibly radical and challenging to follow. This left me confused, especially knowing that Bartók employs several counterpoint techniques that are commonly used in the works of many Western composers, including contrary motion, imitation, inversions, and call-and-response.</p>

<p>Bartók demonstrates an innovative use of the quartet by investigating the sonorities of the three instruments through techniques such as extreme note ranges, varied glissandos, and his unique interpretation of pizzicato, which involves a vigorous plucking motion that produces a sharp snap upon the string&#8217;s impact with the instrument.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>All art evolves in a cultural, social, and political context and music is no exception. The birth of the Classicism in the 18th Century can be traced to the following phenomena: Enlightenment, democratization, humanism, the emergence of the middle class and the development of new musical styles and instruments.</p>



<p>The Enlightenment  (1685 – 1815) was a transformative era in history that rejected traditional ideas of the time and emphasized the importance of reason and logic. It advocated for a rational, scientific approach to life in contrast to superstition and traditionalism. As critical thinking gained traction, it posed a challenge to the established church and organized religion.</p>



<p>During this period, political upheavals and conflicts were prevalent. The American and French Revolutions, the War of the Austrian Succession, and the Seven Years&#8217; War, among others, played a significant role in shaping the ideals of the epoch, highlighting the significance of equal rights. It led to a steep rising in democratization.</p>



<p>Economically, land was no longer the only source of income. With the advent of manufacturing and trading, job opportunities and skills emerged. Individuals were no longer defined solely by their family background, but by their professions. This transformation led to the emergence of the middle class, which in turn put pressure on society to change institutions and improve their standard of living, income, and social mobility.</p>



<p>In terms of intellectual evolution, humanistic ideas regained their prominence and a newfound belief that life on earth is as important as life after death challenged the church&#8217;s traditional stance. Prominent French intellectuals such as Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau spoke out against outdated concepts of aristocracy, class divisions, and religious and racial prejudices.</p>



<p>During this time, society began to view science and art as complementary rather than opposing forces. There was an increase in the importance of creating harmony and harmony in all aspects of life. The Encyclopaedia of Diderot d’Alembert was a great example of this cross-disciplinary collaboration, as it aimed to gather knowledge from all different areas, including music.</p>



<p>All this led to profound changes in music. </p>



<p>Music was previously only available to the elite, but The Enlightenment changed how music was written and distributed. The music industry became more profitable, and composers were able to earn a living for themselves. Music was democratized, and composers began writing more freely for public concerts pursuing a greater emphasis on the structure of the piece and creating simpler harmonic functions. This led to a departure from the elaborate ornamentation of the Baroque music era.</p>



<p>Musical tastes of the middle-class criteria favoured tuneful, clear and homophonic sounds. The piano, invented in the late Baroque, was capable of greater dynamic sensitivity. Similarly, the violin underwent significant technical changes, resulting in increased range and sound projection. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Programme notes</strong></p>



<p>The beauty of twilight time, between sunset and moonrise, has captivated human beings for centuries. The Latins had an expression for this special time of day &#8211; &#8220;lux quae fugit,&#8221; which translates to &#8220;the light that flees.&#8221; This phrase captures the ephemeral and fleeting nature of twilight, which often invokes a mixture of feelings. Some may feel nostalgic for the day that is ending while others may feel peaceful for the night to start. Despite the tumultuous emotions that arise, the eventual arrival of night inevitably brings a sense of calm and tranquillity.</p>



<p><strong>Composition</strong></p>



<p>My composition takes inspiration from Impressionist music, particularly Debussy&#8217;s preludes. The piece is structured into three distinct parts: the relaxing day, the tumultuous feelings of twilight, and the peace of the night.</p>



<p>To achieve an Impressionistic sound, I started by experimenting with various pentatonic scales on the piano, ultimately settling on the arpeggio of the C# minor pentatonic. This scale forms the basis for the first part of the prelude, with modulations to C# Dorian  (bars 5-6) and A Dorian (bars 7-8).</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a brief transition where I actually don&#8217;t know which C major mode I wrote, but I believe it sounds like a D Dorian until it settles in a C Mixolydian.</p>



<p>The middle section of the piece is marked by a play between C Mixolydian and a Whole Tone scale, with a brief detour into the Whole Tone scale based on Eb (bars 18-19). This leads into the &#8220;cascading&#8221; section, where the music moves from the C Mixolydian to the G major modes of A Dorian and B Phrygian, ending in E harmonic minor. This section aims to explore the extremes of the piano, creating a mysterious feeling of going up and down simultaneously.</p>



<p>The final section of the prelude moves from D Major to G Major and ends in C Major, evoking a sense of peace and tranquillity after the tumultuous emotions of twilight.</p>



<p>Throughout the piece, I utilize a pedal tone to build tension and create a sense of stationary motion.</p>



<p>Overall, my goal in this composition was to capture the essence of Impressionist music by exploring unique scales and timbres on the piano while conveying the range of emotions experienced during the transition from day to night.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Alban Berg (1885-1935), along with Anton Webern (1883–1945), were two of the three composers of the Second Viennese&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alban Berg (1885-1935), along with Anton Webern (1883–1945), were two of the three composers of the Second Viennese School which Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) pioneered. </p>



<p>Alban Berg, an Austrian composer born in Vienna, started his music education with Arnold Schoenberg in 1904. He was active during the remarkable artistic, musical, and literary upsurge in Vienna during the early 20th century, associating with prominent figures such as Gustav Klimt. Berg&#8217;s work is often viewed as more melodious and comprehensible than that of his mentor, Schoenberg. His most renowned compositions encompass a variety of musical forms, including orchestral music, such as Five Orchestral Songs (1912), chamber music, songs, and two pioneering operas, Wozzeck (1925) and Lulu (1937). The Violin Concerto, which Berg composed in 1935, is widely regarded as his masterpiece.</p>



<p>This piece was dedicated to Manon Gropius, the daughter of Alma Mahler and Walter Gropius, who died of polio at the age of eighteen. Berg crafted this piece in two movements, each of which comprised two distinct parts. The first movement adheres to the conventional sonata form, commencing with an Andante section and culminating with an Allegretto segment evocative of dance. This movement is deemed to symbolize life. The second movement primarily revolves around a recurring rhythmic cell (Allegro), which is succeeded by a sombre Adagio portion, portraying death.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="238" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bergs_tone_row_600px.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-1286" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bergs_tone_row_600px.jpeg 600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bergs_tone_row_600px-300x119.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Berg&#8217;s use of the twelve-tone row in the composition is considerably rooted in conventional harmony. This is due to the fact that the twelve-tone row can be divided into three triad chords, succeeded by notes of the whole tone scale that lead up to G. Alternatively, the tone row can be analyzed as G minor major 7, A minor major 7, followed by the notes of the whole tone scale.</p>



<p>Upon listening to the piece and studying the score, it appears that Berg&#8217;s selection of the tone row effectively established tonality into an essentially atonal framework. I believe that this decision contributed to the composers&#8217; capacity to pay tribute to Manon Gropius.</p>



<p>Ultimately, despite the rigorously technical structure, the composition evokes strong emotional sentiments and conveys profound expressivity.</p>



<p>Anton Webern, a notable composer and conductor, was also born in Vienna. In 1904 he started receiving composition lessons from Arnold Schoenberg. Webern is considered as one of the foremost proponents of the twelve-tone technique and is renowned for pushing it to its limits. Despite producing some orchestral works, his work primarily comprises vocal and instrumental chamber music, with only a single symphonic composition.</p>



<p>His compositional style is distinguished by its succinctness, brevity, and intensity. The composer undertook an exploration of innovative dimensions of musical expression, particularly atonality, while simultaneously exhibiting meticulous attention to detail, and at times, an exacting rigidity in his musical compositions. He was very fond of utilizing classical forms as a foundational framework upon which to construct his twelve-tone music. I believe that his compositional style is particularly evident in Symphony, Op.21.</p>



<p>In contrast to Berg&#8217;s concerto, Webern&#8217;s Symphony highlights a more radical utilization of the twelve-tone methodology. The use of canons in the first movement and the theme and variations in the second movement are a more methodical use for the twelve-tone. Despite the presence of classical forms in this composition, its analysis presents considerable challenges to me. The melody line, shaped by the canons and their inversions, rapidly transitions between different instruments, reflecting a distinctive style of Webern&#8217;s compositional style.</p>

Available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PDcD3PoYA4.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Webern&#8217;s implementation of the twelve-tone row methodology is characterized by a pronounced mathematical orientation, contrasting with Berg&#8217;s harmonic approach. The composer utilized a symmetrical row structure that may be divided into two parts, with the second part representing a retrograde of the first. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the interval between the first and twelfth, second and eleventh, and so forth, is always a tritone. This row exemplifies Webern&#8217;s preference for the utilization of half-steps in his compositions.</p>

<p>After listening to it several times, I feel that the composition is distinguished by its minimalistic character and sparse texture. Despite the limited instrumentation, the piece is remarkable for its extraordinary intensity. The attention to detail is evident in the nuanced interplay of instruments, where each contributes to a great variety of colour and texture, creating a dense and complex web of sounds that together form a cohesive whole.</p>

<p>I decided to listen to Devonté Hynes&#8217; music after reading a review in the Guardian of his concert with the London Symphony Orchestra. I didn&#8217;t know his work, so it was interesting to dig a bit into his work. </p>



<p>Devonté Hynes&#8217; Long Ride II is a two-piano rendition that was written for HBO&#8217;s Series “We Are Who We Are.” Hynes is primarily known for his R&amp;B and indie music, but he has recently been exploring classical music, which I find an interesting move. </p>



<p>The Long Ride II features a repetitive arpeggio and chords in one of the pianos, while the other builds upon the background, almost as if it is improvising. It has an impressionist feeling of improvisation, and perhaps in the live version, the pianist is really improvising.</p>



<p>The piece is based on an F major chord, and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a defined structure. Instead, there is an increase in texture that keeps growing until almost the finale where one of the pianos plays alone, which is like a return to the beginning.</p>



<p>Although Devonté Hynes&#8217; Long Ride II is an intriguing piece of music that showcases Hynes&#8217; exploration of classical music, its repetitive nature doesn&#8217;t appeals to me. Nonetheless, it was worth listening to it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite being perceived as holding irreconcilable positions by their contemporaries, it is now widely understood that the apparent conflict between Schoenberg and Stravinsky was largely manufactured by political propagandists. Contemporary views acknowledge that both artists shared similar aims and objectives.</p>



<p>During the interwar period, the Romantic era approached a state of near-collapse, as evidenced by the prevalence of monumental symphonic works and autobiographical tone poems. This led to a conscious rejection of the whole apparatus of late Romantic music and a call for a simpler, more objective music. They felt the need to go back in time, a nostalgia, for inspiration and perhaps a homage to previous composers such as Mozart, Bach or Beethoven, in order to bring some clarity and order to music. </p>



<p>Various artists had differing perspectives on the interpretation of &#8220;order&#8221;. Notably, serialists, particularly Schoenberg, regarded the notion of order as a strict construct, almost akin to the concept of law. In fact, Josef Matthias Hauer presented his &#8220;law of the twelve tones&#8221; in 1919.</p>



<p>In contrast, there were a group of artists who believed that this order should be less strict and more based on musical forms and stylistic features from previous eras, such as the Classical Period. This led to Neoclassicism.</p>



<p>Neoclassicism involved a rejection of the lush harmonies and exaggerated emotionalism of late Romanticism, as well as a rejection of modernism&#8217;s atonal and experimental tendencies. Instead, neoclassical composers sought to create clear, concise, and intellectually rigorous works using classical forms and structures such as the sonata, concerto, and symphony.</p>



<p>Although Prokofiev&#8217;s Classical Symphony (1918) may seem to be the first neoclassical work, the start of the movement is generally attributed to Igor Stravisnky&#8217;s Pulcinella (1919), a ballet using themes by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and other baroque composers. Stravinsky continued to explore neoclassical ideas in works such as the &#8220;Octet for Wind Instruments&#8221; (1923), the &#8220;Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments&#8221; (1924), and the &#8220;Symphony of Psalms&#8221; (1930). In these works, Stravinsky used classical forms and structures but also incorporated elements of modernism, such as dissonant harmonies and polyrhythms.</p>



<p>One of the most important Neoclassical artists was Paul Hindemith who systematically developed a new contrapuntal style, described as a 20th-century version of Bach.</p>



<p>Some other important composers that have written in neoclassical style are Satie, Bartók, Milhaud, de Falla or Tailleferre. </p>



<p>Given the considerable experimentation and creative exploration present in various musical styles in the early twentieth century, it is understandable why some regarded neoclassicism as a musical step backwards, a regression through past musical history. But as serialism, it is clear now that neoclassicism has become recognized as an important movement that synthesized new and old musical ideas and created a unique aesthetic that continues to inspire contemporary composers.</p>

<p>Gamelan music, originating from Java in Indonesia, features an ensemble of tuned metal instruments, including gongs and percussion instruments. This type of music is also found throughout Southeast Asia. The sound of gamelan music is characterized by an interplay of metallic sounds defined by one of two scales: slendro, which divides the octave into five equal intervals, and pelog, which divides it into seven.</p>



<p>Balinese music is structured like a tree, with different instruments symbolizing the trunk, branches, and flowers. The core melody, or pokok, is played by one group of instruments in one octave. Another group stresses this melody at regular intervals, while a third expands it into a full melody with a range of two to three octaves. A fourth group doubles and paraphrases it an octave higher, while a fifth group plays an ornamental figuration. Gongs punctuate and structure the music, while the drums provide rhythmic support.</p>



<p>Upon listening to gamelan music, one is struck by the clear and metallic sounds, which evoke the stirring of a thousand bells. The interplay of the sounds is delicate, and confused, and possesses a sensuous charm. The overall effect is one of mystery, which can be quite overpowering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The impact of Claude Debussy&#8217;s musical vocabulary on the evolution of jazz has been profound (Pamies, 2021), influencing a number of composers such as Duke Ellington, one of the founding fathers of jazz. (Ross, 2018).</p>



<p>To fully appreciate the compositional styles of Claude Debussy and Miles Davis, it is important to understand the underlying motivations that led to their musical breakthroughs. Both artists sought to distance themselves from the current artistic movements of their time, with Debussy aiming to break away from the influence of Germanic Romanticism and Davis seeking to move beyond the heavy tonality and fast harmonic rhythms of bebop jazz. In other words, both composers sought to break free from the constraints of their respective musical traditions and push the boundaries of what was possible in terms of harmonic and melodic freedom.</p>



<p>To achieve their respective goals, Debussy adopted an Impressionist style of music, while Davis found inspiration in modal jazz.</p>



<p>The 1959 release of Miles Davis&#8217; album, &#8220;Kind of Blue,&#8221; marked a pivotal moment in the history of jazz, especially the inaugural track of the album, &#8220;So What,&#8221; which is famous for being one of the first modal jazz songs.</p>



<p>Waters (2005) argues that there exist four salient techniques that typify modal jazz, namely the utilization of extended pedal points, suppression of standard harmonic progressions, slow harmonic rhythm, and association of a seven-note scalar collection with each harmony. The presence of these characteristics in the music of Debussy is a compelling evidence of his influence on jazz.</p>

<p>Besides the direct reference in the introduction to Debussy&#8217;s Voiles, both styles share a preoccupation with harmony and colour, and they tend to focus on creating a mood or atmosphere rather than following a rigid melodic or harmonic structure. Debussy’s use of whole-tone and pentatonic scales and unconventional chord progressions echo the modal jazz style that Davis developed in “So What.”</p>



<p>Regarding dissonance, one of Debussy&#8217;s biggest influences in this track in particular and in Jazz, in general, is the idea of “free dissonance”. The thinking that the 7th or 9th of a chord can exist as a sonority on its own without the need for resolution into a consonance. </p>



<p>Additionally, &#8220;So What&#8221; reflects another significant feature of Debussy&#8217;s style: improvisational feeling. Focusing on the use of a single mode or scale over extended periods and placing equal harmonic weight on all notes associated with a particular chord, resulted in a heightened sense of liberation in both melodic and harmonic exploration, ultimately fostering a greater degree of creative freedom for improvisation and experimentation.This approach influenced the genre and ultimately led to the development of Free Jazz.</p>



<p>Overall, it can be argued that Debussy&#8217;s influence on Miles Davis and Bill Evans can be summed up as promoting harmonic and melodic freedom, with a focus on color, imagination, and sound.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 1781, Franz Joseph Haydn composed his Op. 33 String Quartets, which he dedicated to the Grand Duke Paul of Russia. Consequently, these quartets are frequently referred to as the &#8220;Russian&#8221; quartets. The second quartet in E-flat, commonly known as the &#8220;Joke&#8221; quartet, is the most celebrated of the set. The nickname &#8220;Joke&#8221; is believed to have originated from the final movement, which incorporates a series of playful musical jokes, such as a mock conclusion and an unexpected outburst of powerful chords, which leave the listener with a feeling of joyful surprise.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="716" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-716x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1302" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-716x1024.png 716w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-210x300.png 210w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-300x429.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-640x915.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40.png 747w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" /></figure>



<p>Comprising four movements, the piece follows a a non-traditional structure. The first movement is composed in Sonata form, while the second, instead of being a Minuet and Trio, is a Scherzo and Trio. The third and fourth movements are both arranged as a Rondo.</p>



<p>The quartet opens with a delightful theme that is subsequently fragmented, manipulated, and reassembled in various ways. Personally, I found this movement to be lighthearted and fascinating, particularly as Haydn deftly plays with the theme, departing from and returning to it, as demonstrated in the following example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="713" height="517" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.43.45.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1303" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.43.45.png 713w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.43.45-300x218.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.43.45-640x464.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></figure>



<p>The second movement caught my attention with the violin slides present in the Trio section. The movement has a dance-like quality to it, with the second violin intermittently interacting with the first violin. At the same time, the viola and cello provide a steady foundation for the piece.</p>



<p>The third movement presents a stark contrast, opening with the lower strings and at a slower tempo in a Largo style. I found the movement to be somewhat dramatic, particularly with the powerful forte chords played by all strings. An illustration of this effect is evident in the following example towards the end of the movement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="453" height="295" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.57.43.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1307" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.57.43.png 453w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.57.43-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></figure>



<p>The Rondo in the fourth movement shows a catchy, memorable theme that is both danceable and owns a humorous character. The coda segment of the movement is surprising, as the expected recurrence of the theme is subject to hesitant pauses, creating a sense of suspense and uncertainty for the listener. The final pause builds a sense of anticipation, ultimately ending with a soft whisper that leaves the listener with an unresolved sense of closure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Voiles,&#8221; meaning &#8220;sails&#8221; or &#8220;veils,&#8221; gave me the impression of a connection to the wind. As I listened to it, the gentle, ethereal quality of the music immediately brought to mind the iconic Plastic Bag scene from the film &#8220;American Beauty.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="AMERICAN BEAUTY ~ Plastic Bag Scene [HD]" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qssvnjj5Moo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>After re-watching the scene, I believe the composer, Thomas Newman, was inspired by Debussy&#8217;s &#8220;Voiles&#8221;. There are similarities between the two pieces: both feature motifs that move in parallel chords, with an unresolved melodicism and a persistent pedal point running throughout.</p>



<p>While &#8220;Voiles&#8221; evokes a sense of wind, it also carries a certain air of mystery, which can be attributed to the concept of veils. The pervasive use of the whole-tone scale throughout the piece may contribute to this enigmatic quality, adding to the overall impression of ambiguity and uncertainty.</p>



<p>In the opening of the prelude, Debussy builds a small melodic motif around a whole-tone scale harmonized by intervals of a 3rd and 4th, with the pedal note B-flat providing a sense of grounding that will persist throughout almost every bar of the piece. In a way, it seems as though the piece doesn&#8217;t really go anywhere &#8211; it lacks a clear direction or purpose, much like a veil (or a plastic bag) caught in the wind. It simply floats and drifts, carried along by the shifting currents of the melody.</p>



<p>Debussy repeats and develops the initial motif throughout the piece until he eventually suspends the pedal and introduces a new melodic element &#8211; a minor pentatonic scale in E-flat &#8211; as a response and a closing of the development. This section feels like a release from the constraint of the previous material and is perhaps the most exciting part of the piece. However, it doesn&#8217;t last long, and soon the melody returns to its drifting, aimless quality, leaving the listener with a sense of unresolved tension and mystery.</p>



<p>The main whole-tone section returns after just a few bars, and with it comes the sensation of floating, only now with some runs that add a bit of movement to the melody. There&#8217;s a sense that the piece is building towards a climax, with a cadence perhaps just around the corner &#8211; but it never arrives. The floating feeling persists all the way to the end, leaving the listener with a sense of lingering uncertainty and an unfulfilled sense of resolution.</p>



<p>Especially in the first few pages of the score, I can sense a clear counterpoint between the voices, such as the use of contrary motion in this example, as well as a sense of distinct rhythms between them.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The history of the modes goes back to ancient Greece when they used different scale systems to divide&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The history of the modes goes back to ancient Greece when they used different scale systems to divide the octave and named them after territories of Greece and around. The Christian church, around 750 AD, developed seven different scale patterns called Gregorian chant, and gave them the names of the Greek modes, without worrying about their similarities. By 1700, most music used only two of the seven modes, which became known as the major and minor keys. In modern music, modes are less commonly used than major or minor keys, but they can also be found in folk, jazz, classical, and pop music (Powell, 2011).</p>



<p>The seven Greek modes are:</p>



<ol>
<li>Ionian (also known as the major scale)</li>



<li>Dorian</li>



<li>Phrygian</li>



<li>Lydian</li>



<li>Mixolydian</li>



<li>Aeolian (also known as the natural minor scale)</li>



<li>Locrian</li>
</ol>



<p>Each mode consists of a set pattern of tones and semitones derived from the W-W-H-W-W-W-H pattern from the major scale as we can see from the example below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="803" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-803x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1259" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-803x1024.png 803w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-235x300.png 235w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-768x980.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-300x383.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-640x817.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-960x1225.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57.png 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The seven European heptatonic diatonic &#8220;church&#8221; modes (Tagg,2014)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The most interesting aspect to me is understanding why should a composer use such modes. The straight answer is to give the composer more emotional options than the standard major and minor dichotomy. With modes, is as if the composer is able to introduce, even briefly, a new colour or flavour to convey a specific mood or emotion.</p>



<p>I found Tagg&#8217;s (2014) explanation of which traits each mode has, very helpful.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ionian</strong>: is the most common mode in western music and its intervals are the most comfortable to the regular western listener. Music in Ionian mode tends to be happy and bright with examples such as national anthems (God Save The Queen, The Star-Spangled Banner), Happy Birthday or Jingle Bells.</li>



<li><strong>Dorian</strong>: after the Ionian and Aeolian, this is the most common mode mostly because of its similarity with the natural minor (except for the raised sixth in Dorian). Its distinctiveness comes from the combination of minor 3rd and 7th and major 6th. In order to sound Dorian, one must use the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 6th which lends the music a melancholic yet optimistic sound.</li>



<li><strong>Phrygian: </strong>this is the only mode that has a minor 2nd and a perfect 5th and it&#8217;s commonly used in Flamenco. Being a minor mode, it has a darker feel than the Aeolian because of the minor 2nd and has been used by the heavy metal genre to convey a mysterious and &#8220;doom&#8221; feeling, such as in Wherever I May Roam by Metallica.</li>



<li><strong>Lydian:</strong> this mode is just like Ionian but it has a raised 4th which lends the scale an airy, floating and happier sound than Ionian. Film composers tend to adopt this mode for cheerful tunes, John WIlliams one of its main adepts using it in themes such as ET and Back to the Future.</li>



<li><strong>Mixolodyan:</strong> similar to Ionian but with a flattened 7th is characteristic for having a lack of leading tone, which makes it sound smoother than a major scale. It is commonly used in traditional songs from England and Ireland, as well as tunes from Northeastern Brazil, such as Forró. It is also used in rock guitar solos since the flattened 7th exists in the 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th chords.</li>



<li><strong>Aeolian:</strong> is the same as a natural minor scale and its characteristic sound comes from the positioning of its two semitones &#8211; between the 2nd and 3rd, and the 5th and 6th. The repetition of these intervals is perceived as conveying grief, pain or misery. It can be heard in Chopin&#8217;s Marche Funebre as well as Nirvana&#8217;s Smells Like Teen Spirit.</li>



<li><strong>Locrian: </strong>is the least used mode because of its lack of a perfect fifth and a presence of a tritone between the 1st and 5th. It is extremely dissonant and unstable with an extreme tension that lends it a dark mood. It&#8217;s hard to find examples of songs using this mode, but Björk&#8217;s Army Of Me is one of the few examples that keep appearing.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Claude Debussy&#8217;s &#8220;Prélude à l&#8217;après-midi d&#8217;un faune&#8221; is a musical composition that is based on the poem &#8220;L’après-midi d’un faune&#8221; Stéphane Mallarmé. The poem tells the story of a faun, a mythical creature who is half-man and half-goat, as he wakes up from a nap in the forest and is overwhelmed by lustful desires towards nymphs. </p>



<p>This bucolic poem represented a historic milestone of literary symbolism. It places emphasis on the stimuli surrounding the action, rather than the action itself. This creates a reality that is diffuse, with a stronger focus on perception than representation. Is the faun dreaming? Or is all that real? The reader never knows. What is true is that the poem is full of ambiguity and musicality, taking advantage of the French language and its nuances: colour, vowels, and diphthongs. Mallarmé followed the French belief of that time: &#8220;how you say something is as important as what you say: style (timbre) is as important as substance (pitch and rhythm)&#8221; (Greenberg, 2013).</p>



<p>Debussy&#8217;s &#8220;Prélude à l&#8217;après-midi d&#8217;un faune,&#8221; composed between 1892 and 1894, is a musical reflection of the elusive ambiguity present in Mallarmé&#8217;s poem. The fluid rhythms and tonal uncertainties of Debussy&#8217;s composition effectively capture the hazy, indistinct quality of Mallarmé&#8217;s writing.</p>



<p>I believe it cannot be considered a symphonic poem, as it does not adhere to a narrative or a formal structure based on the exposition-development-recapitulation sequence. Instead, it flows freely, mimicking the emotions of its titular character. This free-form approach was a wise decision, as it keeps the listener engaged and constantly surprised. With each listening, one is never quite certain where the music is headed, making for a captivating and unpredictable musical experience.</p>



<p>Starting from the famous opening flute melody, which has an emphasis on the tritone (the ambiguous interval), followed by the horns and soft harp glissandos, set a dreamy and soft awaking tone that resembles the opening of the poem.</p>



<p>One of the most intriguing parts for me starts in bar 17, where the oboe and clarinet produce a sensual and exotic sound. They are then joined by the full orchestra before the clarinet is left to play alone. To me, it feels like the sound of the wind, a whisper, or a call. The repetition of the orchestra adds depth and enhances the overall effect, making this part truly captivating.</p>

<p>Debussy, in my opinion, uses all the sounds and timbres at his disposal to convey the emotions he perceives in Mallarmé&#8217;s poem. He does not follow a specific structure or formal harmonic progression or even tries to follow the story of the poem. Instead, he uses the music as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself, being effective in evoking senses beyond the earthly and capable of creating a fantastical and almost hypnotic musical experience. </p>



<p>This approach aligns with the principles of impressionist painters and symbolist poets who were more concerned with evoking emotions through their work, rather than simply creating a realistic representation. This shift in perspective paved the way for the development of modern art as we know it today.</p>

<p>During my research on Debussy, I discovered that he and Stravinsky were close friends. Following Debussy&#8217;s death, Stravinsky paid tribute by composing a serene chorale, which was later incorporated into the &#8220;Symphonies of Wind Instruments&#8221; in 1920. In 1945, Stravinsky revised the work, publishing it in 1947, and made alterations including the removal of the alto flute and alto clarinet, as well as reworking the musical score.</p>



<p>After listening to it the first time, I absolutely loved this piece. I keep finding Stravinsky&#8217;s work amazing and it&#8217;s one of the composers I most like to listen to, but at the same time is the one I find most difficult to analyze. In the next paragraphs I&#8217;ll try to understand what made me like this piece.</p>



<p>The first hint comes from the title. The &#8220;Symphonies of Wind Instruments&#8221; is a musical work with a title that alludes to the original definition of symphony (as opposed to the musical form) as a harmonious blending of instruments. That&#8217;s one of the characteristics of this piece that stroke me right away. The interplay between the different wind instruments, particularly in terms of the contrasting chromatic tones between the woodwinds and brass, is particularly striking. Stravinsky&#8217;s manipulation of the instruments, such as in bar 3 where he plays a Bb in the trumpet and a B in the clarinets, creates a unique sonic landscape that highlights the tonal differences between the instruments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="774" height="900" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1243" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41.png 774w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41-258x300.png 258w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41-768x893.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41-300x349.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41-640x744.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /></figure>



<p>The formal structure of the piece proves to be elusive and challenging to categorize. It frequently alternates between tempos, including 144, 108, and 72 beats per minute, which are related by a ratio of 2:3:4. The fluctuating time signature only adds to the impression of multiple distinct musical ideas being woven together in the composition.</p>



<p>From the beginning, Stravinsky introduces contrasting thematic materials, switching between joyful flutes, mournful full chords, and the chorale theme, which symbolizes Debussy&#8217;s death or funeral. Throughout the piece, there is no clear narrative or progression. The musical ideas seem to shift abruptly, giving the impression of a series of disconnected fragments.</p>



<p>The chorale theme, which recurs throughout the piece, serves as a unifying thread and provides the piece with a sense of direction. It becomes the focus of the conclusion, which is joyful and uplifting, spreading a sense of peace and resolution.</p>



<p> </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a significant transformation in society as a result of rapid advancements in science and technology. The invention of new forms of communication led to a change in perceptions of time, space and distance. All these frenetic changes paved the way for new ideas, new perceptions and a new ability to process art that led artists to completely break with the old ways of doing art and start thinking about how they can be relevant in a constant-changing world.</p>



<p>Beyond the hyper expressivity and the “abortive gesture” &#8211; doing the “wrong” thing for the “right” expressive reason &#8211; there were technological advances in materials such as recordings or new canvas that allowed artists to explore their expressions outside.</p>



<p>It was in this context that two styles emerged: impressionism and symbolism.</p>



<p>The Impressionist movement in art sought to capture the reality of the modern world, taking inspiration from the realism of Gustave Courbet. The movement was characterized by its emphasis on capturing the fleeting and ephemeral aspects of light and colour in outdoor environments, diverging from the established tradition of creating posed and historical compositions in a studio setting.</p>



<p>The term &#8220;Impressionism&#8221; as a label for the movement gained widespread recognition following the criticism by Louis Leroy of Claude Monet&#8217;s &#8220;Impression, Sunrise&#8221; (Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris) in 1874, which he disparagingly referred to as a mere &#8220;impression&#8221;.</p>



<p>The chief exponents of Impressionism were Paris-based and include Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas in visual arts and Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel in music.</p>



<p>In contrast, the Symbolist movement was characterized by the use of symbols and imagery to express deeper, abstract concepts and emotions. The movement was influenced by the ideas of Charles Baudelaire and other Symbolist poets, who sought to evoke a deeper meaning beyond the literal representation of objects or scenes in their works.</p>



<p>Prominent Symbolists, such as Paul Gauguin, James Whistler, Gustave Moreau, and Odilon Redon, utilized this approach to explore themes such as spirituality, the unconscious, and the imagination.</p>



<p>But in the end, both Impressionists and Symbolists shared a motivation to represent the ephemeral and emotional elements of experience, in order to facilitate the expression of the artist&#8217;s feelings. These movements disrupted conventional modes of artistic expression and established avenues for subsequent art movements, be it through visual arts, poetry, or music.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I approached this assignment by first thinking about the piece&#8217;s structure, drawing inspiration from Bach&#8217;s violin sonata. I&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I approached this assignment by first thinking about the piece&#8217;s structure, drawing inspiration from Bach&#8217;s violin sonata. I researched various baroque dances, such as the Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, and Gigue, and decided to use the Allemande as a primary inspiration because of its 4/4 meter and binary form. After going through the chords several times, I decided to make my piece in binary form as well: the first section from bar 1 to bar 16 and the second from bar 17 to bar 33.</p>



<p>I chose the first section to be 16 bars long, as this is a common length for the first section of dances like Allemande and Bach&#8217;s sonata. Additionally, the perfect cadence from bar 15 (C major) to bar 16 (F major) and the transition from F major to Bb major in bar 17 made it a logical choice. The presence of rehearsal letters also hinted that there would be a break in this section.</p>



<p>As soon as I determined the structure of my composition, <a href="./../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" target="_blank">I reviewed my previous analysis of Bach&#8217;s violin sonata to better understand his techniques</a>. </p>



<p>My composition plan was to introduce the main theme of the sonata in the first bars and then explore it with repetitions and variations until the end of the A section. The B section would start with a similar theme, but with some slight changes to keep it fresh and then move to the main theme until the end of the piece.</p>



<p>One of the challenges I faced right at the beginning of the composition was finding the right rhythms and notes. I tried several combinations and ideas but I ended up feeling that they didn&#8217;t match the Baroque style I was aiming for. Either sounded too simple or too uninteresting. My solution was to borrow material from my previous exercise, which was based on Bach&#8217;s Sonata for Viola da Gamba &amp; Harpsichord in G Minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="676" height="242" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1165" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png 676w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-300x107.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-640x229.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Exercise 3.4 theme</figcaption></figure>



<p>But even after finding a theme, I wasn&#8217;t satisfied with how it sounded in the first four bars, so I decided to begin it at rehearsal mark A (bar 5) and develop it from there. Overall, I was pleased with how the melody turned out and specifically enjoyed applying the lessons I learned from Bach by allowing the C# in bar 8 to move to bar 9 instead of resolving to D.</p>



<p>There was a challenge with the first 4 bars since I lacked ideas as to what to do in order to make them interesting. My solution was to write an introduction that hinted at the main theme&#8217;s rhythm, as a preview of what was to come. Despite not being able to find out whether an introduction was common to the Baroque style, I decided to include it since it made sense in this composition.</p>



<p>My goal in the B section was to make the violin sound freer, but not totally different from the previous section. In order to achieve this, I kept the tied note and the three descending notes from the main theme.</p>



<p>The next step was ornamenting the violin and the treble harpsichord. I looked into Taylor (1998), Apel (1969) and Bach (1949) for guidance and kept in mind that Bach used ornamentations at the perfect timing. The main difficulty I faced was understanding how to write the first and final notes on the trills regarding the previous and the next note. For example, in bars 2 and 12, the previous note is the same upper note of the trill. Should the player play it two times or make it tied? I couldn&#8217;t find a definitive answer but it made sense to me to be tied.</p>

<p>Overall, I am pleased with how I was able to incorporate elements from Bach&#8217;s sonata into my composition, but I am aware that it may not sound as authentically Baroque as it could. Sometimes it sounds too contemporary. Possibly the pivotal question is this: How can we write in the style of a specific era if we have been influenced by later ones? This may be a constant challenge that composers face, and it&#8217;s something that I kept in mind throughout the composition process. Despite this, I am happy with the final result and how it captures the essence of the Baroque style while incorporating my own creative choices.</p>

<p>Vivaldi Recomposed, composed by the British composer Max Richter and performed by the Konzerthaus Kammerorchester Berlin, is a reinterpretation of Antonio Vivaldi&#8217;s iconic Four Seasons. Richter, known for his unique blend of classical and contemporary music, masterfully weaves themes and ideas from the original composition and adds his modern touch to create a fresh and exciting listening experience.</p>



<p>When I first heard about Vivaldi Recomposed, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder why a composer would take on such a bold and daring task. After all, the Four Seasons is considered a masterpiece, so why would anyone want to tamper with it? But Richter&#8217;s response to this question was simple and illuminating: &#8220;It&#8217;s just everywhere. In a way, we stop being able to hear it.&#8221; (Service, 2017). And with that, it all made sense. The Four Seasons has become so ubiquitous that it has become background noise. I prefer to look at this work as a wake-up call or a provocation to think about something you take for granted.</p>



<p>After listening to it more than once, a few elements caught my attention. First and foremost, Richter&#8217;s work is not an arrangement of the original piece, but an entirely reimagined interpretation based on Vivaldi&#8217;s core. This became clear to me when my 5-year-old daughter began whistling like a bird when I listened to the Spring movement. Richter effectively conveyed the birds singing as Vivaldi intended, but in a creative and innovative way.</p>



<p>Another aspect that caught my attention was the simplicity and repetition of the movements. I don&#8217;t see it as superior or inferior to Vivaldi&#8217;s original, but a reflection of modern aesthetics valuing repetition over baroque flamboyance, and Richter&#8217;s style emphasizing prolonged notes played over repetitive themes (e.g. Infra 8).</p>



<p>Additionally, the use of synthesizers in the piece was particularly interesting to me, as they were used not to over-modernize the soundscape, but rather as a hint of modernity that amplified the range of sounds and added depth to the strings.</p>



<p>I can rephrase the initial &#8220;Why?&#8221; to &#8220;Should?&#8221; I believe the answer is yes, composers like Richter should continue creating recomposed works, <a href="./../../../listening-to-boris-blacher-variations-on-a-theme-of-paganini/index.html" data-type="post" data-id="135" target="_blank">as I previously observed</a>.</p>



<p>I believe music is a living and organic force, not a static one. The reason for this is that musical instruments evolved, tuning evolved, and players evolved. Therefore, the way we hear these compositions today doesn&#8217;t sound the way they did when previous composers such as Vivaldi composed them. By reimagining these works, we not only pay tribute to the greats of the past but also ensure that music lives on for generations to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Reading &#8220;How to Listen to Great Music&#8221; by Robert Greenberg has been an invaluable resource in learning how to listen to and analyze music. The author suggests listening to Bach&#8217;s Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 as a way to gain a deeper understanding of Baroque concertos, with a particular emphasis on the ritornello. The concerto, which is composed for flute, solo violin, harpsichord, and strings, presents several interesting features upon listening and studying the score.</p>



<p>Right from the start of the concerto, I noticed the ritornello theme, which was highlighted by Greenberg, and how it reappears in fragments throughout the movement before being repeated in the end after the harpsichord solo.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="547" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-1024x547.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1209" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-1024x547.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-300x160.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-768x410.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-640x342.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-960x513.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29.png 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ritornello Theme</figcaption></figure>



<p>As Greenberg explains in his book, the function of the ritornello theme is to create a sense of logical inevitability, providing a feeling of returning home and familiarity, even if only for a brief moment. This helps the listener relax and not be overwhelmed by constant new sounds.</p>



<p>It works similarly to a chorus in modern-day popular music. but it typically appears at the beginning and end of the movement, while choruses in contemporary music typically appear in the middle and end of songs. I am curious as to why composers have shifted the placement of this familiar theme from the beginning to the middle of their compositions.</p>



<p>The concerto is also notable for its use of the harpsichord as a solo instrument. The harpsichord, which was a relatively new instrument at the time, was often used as a continuo instrument to accompany other instruments. However, in this concerto, according to Greenberg, Bach was the first to elevate the harpsichord to the role of a true solo instrument, giving it an equal voice alongside the flute and violin. And this solo is extremely impressive and virtuoso.</p>



<p>This movement also stands out for its unique use of the harpsichord as a solo instrument. While it was often used as a continuo instrument in the past, Bach elevated its role to that of a true solo instrument, giving it equal importance alongside the flute and violin. According to Greenberg, this concerto marks a significant moment in music history as the harpsichord&#8217;s solo capabilities were truly showcased for the first time. </p>



<p>The second movement of the concerto is an affettuoso, characterized by its melodic singing between the flute and violin. As I listened, I noticed two features that I had previously encountered in Bach&#8217;s violin sonata &#8211; the use of long, melodic lines that persistently avoid resolving to a steady cadence (as exemplified by the flute&#8217;s quick movement to C), and the repetition of a rhythmic pattern (in this case, quaver-quaver-dotted semiquaver-demisemiquaver) throughout the entire movement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.20.07.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1210" width="445" height="304" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.20.07.png 738w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.20.07-300x205.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.20.07-640x437.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" /></figure>



<p>The third movement starts with the exposition of a fugal theme by the violin, which is then repeated by the flute. However, as the movement progresses, the violin and flute often play in unison, rather than in counterpoint as is typical in a true fugue. Despite this, there is a significant use of polyphonic texture throughout the movement.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="Glenn Gould &amp; Yehudi Menuhin - Bach, Sonata No. 4 in C minor (OFFICIAL)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Boii0EA6hWo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>This sonata looks like a good example of Baroque music, characterized by its long melodic lines and ornamental elements. Upon listening to it for the first time played by Glenn Gould and Yehudi Menuhin, I feel that there&#8217;s an interesting contrast between the smoothness of the violin and the pointed, moving accompaniment of the harpsichord. After listening to it several times and studying the score, I noticed several unique features.</p>



<p>One of the key observations I made was that the harpsichord had a repetitive pattern, which allowed the violin to take centre stage. The bass harpsichord usually played a continuous arpeggio starting on the downbeat, while the treble harpsichord had an upward and downward motion with its highest note on the second note of the violin rhythm. The violin melody, in section A, seemed to be a long single melody that lasted 16 bars. Although I could definitely hear that the melody line didn&#8217;t settle until bar 16 and it seemed like Bach avoided a cadence in bars 8 and 12, I was unsure of how he achieved this effect. But my tutor helped clarify that it was a mixture of harmony, not having a perfect cadence, melody/rhythm notes that cross bars, and the use of weaker inversions of chords that gave a feeling of movement instead of a final rest. I hadn&#8217;t thought about how inverting chords could transmit a sense movement and it made much more sense to me after his answer.</p>



<p>Another observation I made was the rhythm of the violin melody and its repetition. This movement of the sonata is a Siciliano which is a musical style from the baroque era, usually in a slow 6/8 time and in a minor key. The violin follows the traditional Siciliana rhythms with a dotted quaver &#8211; semiquaver &#8211; quaver. It&#8217;s interesting to notice that Bach uses this exact rhythm 36 times and some of its variations throughout this movement but without making it feel repetitive. The use of ornamentation is essential here.</p>

<p>Overall, I find this piece to be deceptively simple yet incredibly evocative and emotionally charged. Reflecting on its various features has helped me gain a deeper understanding of how to approach my assignment with greater insight and understanding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The exercise proved to be more challenging than anticipated. I began by creating the chords as outlined in the instructions, which was enjoyable and entertaining. It took some time to figure out the different melodic lines and determine whether, for example, the bass should move upward or downward from bar 1 to bar 2. Ultimately, I ended up with more dynamic lines in the Tenor and Bass compared to the Soprano and Alto, which appeared to be a bit static.</p>



<p>The most challenging aspect for me was developing the melodic lines. I found that the Tenor and Bass lines were easier to work with and changing them added an interesting rhythm to the phrase. In beat 3 of bar 1, I added a passing note to the Tenor to shorten the leap. In bar 3, I continued to add quavers to the Tenor and Bass to maintain a similar rhythm as the first part.</p>



<p>Upon examining Bach’s harmonization, I noticed that the main difference was that he added much more interest to bar 4, particularly with the descending Tenor.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[During my research, I discovered that Bach is well-known for his prolific composition of cantatas, both secular and&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During my research, I discovered that Bach is well-known for his prolific composition of cantatas, both secular and sacred. He developed the &#8220;chorale cantata&#8221; style and at his most productive, he composed one cantata per week for eight years. Between 1723 and 1729, Bach completed four yearly cycles consisting of about 60 cantatas each (Greer, 2002).</p>



<p>&#8220;Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140&#8221; is one of his most famous cantatas which relates the story from Matthew 25:1-13, about the ten virgins waiting for the arrival of the bridegroom (Christ).</p>



<p>This Cantata follows a symmetrical structure where it includes a chorale in the middle movement and is framed by two sets of recitative-aria movements. The cantata begins and ends with chorale-choruses, which I found to be a common feature in Bach’s compositions.</p>



<p>After listening to the cantata three times (without score, with score and after my research), I found it to be a dramatic and theatrical piece, but even more impressive when I learned about the context in which it was performed in a church setting.</p>



<p>For example, in the first movement, the retornello in the first 4 bars reminded me of a wedding and it was only after my research that I found out that the setting of this movement is the calling of all Jerusalem to prepare for a wedding feast. Another example of the dramatism is how the voices of this first movement don’t start singing together, but arrive one by one, as if they are arriving to the event.</p>

<p>The uplifting feeling in the first movement comes from the serene instrumentation combined with the uplifting lines of the chorale.</p>

<p>I found the second movement to be like a narrator, with the Tenor voice, moving the story forward in the. The third movement is a dialogue between the Soul (Soprano) and Jesus (Bass) and in the fourth movement, I found the conjunction of a simple melody line of the tenor with a danceable string melody supported by the continuos movement of the continuo very pleasing. </p>



<p>The seventh movement, the last choral part, is a hymn so that all the congregation can join and sing in a final movement. That&#8217;s why the soprano sings the melody and the other voices fill in the harmony.</p>



<p>I found listening to Cantata No. 140 by Bach enjoyable, but it was more enriching to understand the meaning and context of the composition. At first, I didn&#8217;t fully grasp the nuances and constructions Bach made, but by learning more about cantatas and their role in bringing people together in a church setting, I was able to appreciate it more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The exercise proved to be more complex and time-consuming than anticipated. I began by creating the bass line, using a continuous quaver pattern like Bach does in the sonata I was studying. However, I decided to make the line ascend and descend in all bars except for bar 3. Then, I moved on to the treble line where I attempted to imitate Bach&#8217;s repetitive style but found it lacking interest. To add some variety, I incorporated some rhythm borrowed from Bach&#8217;s Sonata for Viola da Gamba &amp; Harpsichord in G Minor. Finally, I wrote the melody, which proved to be challenging due to the prominent harpsichord treble line. I found myself questioning if that&#8217;s why Bach kept it repetitive. Despite this, I completed the violin melody, complementing the harpsichord.</p>



<p>In regards to cadence, I tried to leave it unresolved, similar to Bach in his sonata but found that the unresolved cadence is more prominent in the harpsichord line than the violin.</p>



<p>In the end, I was not entirely satisfied with the violin melody. I believe it needs to be made more distinct and not so closely tied to the harpsichord.</p>



<p></p>

<p>After closely analyzing Bach&#8217;s piece, I gained a deeper understanding of the movement of chords, particularly the bass line. I observed how skillfully he transitioned from the C minor scale to the G major. This prompted me to redo the exercise, attempting to replicate Bach&#8217;s approach on the harpsichord more closely.</p>



<p>To my surprise, the exercise seemed simpler this time around. Whether it was due to having done it previously or my increasing knowledge of Bach&#8217;s writing, I am not sure. I transferred my original harpsichord treble line to the violin and wrote the harpsichord lines afterwards.</p>



<p>Overall, I was quite pleased with the outcome of my second attempt. The piece appeared more cohesive, with the violin melody standing out without constant competition from the other lines.</p>

<p>Although I appreciate pop music, I&#8217;m usually turned away from songs that are too popular on the charts. But, when I stumbled upon SZA&#8217;s &#8220;Kill Bill&#8221; on the radio without knowing what it was, I was extremely surprised. The song really caught my attention. My impression was that the song never settled down, a feeling (a very good feeling) I also had when <a href="./../../../listening-to-beach-boys-god-only-knows/index.html" data-type="post" data-id="531" target="_blank">listening to God Only Knows</a>.</p>



<p>The aspect that impressed me the most was the chorus vocal melody. It was straightforward yet stunning and flowed smoothly. Upon transcribing it, I discovered the song was in Ab Major, but the vocal melody only utilized the Ab once on the last note of the 4th beat, which was a rather weak one. There was also an A flat, a chromatic note just a half-step from the tonic, leading to a sense of uncertainty and incompletion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="74" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1024x74.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1222" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1024x74.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-300x22.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-768x55.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1536x111.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-2048x148.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-640x46.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-960x69.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26.png 2578w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The chord progression also caught my attention. Throughout the song, it used the same progression: Bbm-Eb-Ab-F or ii-V-I-VI. This again contributed to a sense of instability as it started on ii and placed the I on the third bar, which is a weaker position for establishing the key. The final chord was a modulation to a chromatic chord of F Major, which was my favourite part of the chorus. It was playful, and daring, and complemented the lyrics perfectly (e.g. &#8220;Rather be in jail than alone&#8221;).</p>



<p>But right from the beginning, the song starts off sounding vague. There&#8217;s a distinct out-of-tune waver that is completely undefined. From that point, the song could head in any direction. Then, the drum beat enters and as with any typical pop song, you anticipate listening to a four-beat loop until the vocals begin. But the vocals come in on the fourth beat, like an anacrusis, unexpectedly.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I don&#8217;t think &#8220;Kill Bill&#8221; will be regarded as a masterpiece like &#8220;God Only Knows,&#8221; but in today&#8217;s landscape of overwhelming similar-sounding pop music, I found the song to be invigorating. I hope it serves as inspiration for other artists to create pop music that departs from standard harmonic and melodic structures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ornamentation was one of the prominent features of the Baroque era and can be loosely described as the practice of embellishing music by adding extra notes and little figures in a very specific style.</p>



<p>Although there is evidence that the ornamentation of melodies goes back to early singers of Gregorian chant, it wasn&#8217;t until the late Renaissance and early Baroque that the ornamentation became stereotyped. It was in France, that the practice of ornamentation in music was standardized under the name &#8220;agréments,&#8221; allowing for the use of signs or abbreviations to indicate them in a score (Apel, 1969).</p>



<p>In order to understand why ornamentation in music was so prominent in the Baroque era, especially the late Baroque, I turned to the article &#8220;Late Baroque Ornamentation: Philosophy and Guideline&#8221; by David Lasocki in which the author details six purposes for the extensive use of these decorative elements during this period.</p>



<p>First, according to the author, it was an essential component of the Baroque aesthetic, emphasising the ornate and decorative. Second, it gave the performer &#8220;an opportunity to demonstrate their judgement, inventiveness, and insight&#8221;. Third, performers had more training and desire to play more than the music exactly as written. Fourth, ornamentation added verve and freshness to the performance through spontaneous recomposition. Fifth, ornamentation helped to create variety in multiple performances of the same work. Finally, it was expected by both performers and audiences, since performers would likely have attempted to use ornamentation in order to please their colleagues and audiences (Lasocki, 1988).</p>



<p>According to Robert Donington in The Interpretation of Early Music, there were more than one hundred and twenty-five signs used in early music, but Victor Rangel-Ribeiro claims that only four were used enough &#8220;to have become characteristic of Baroque music&#8221; (Rangel-Ribeiro, 2016): the appoggiatura (a dissonant note resolving on the weaker beat to the next note above or below), the trill (rapid alternation of the main note with a higher auxiliary note), the mordent (a rapid alternation of the main note with the note immediately below it), and the turn (a decorative flourish consisting of a rapid alternation of the main note with the note above it).</p>



<p>One of the challenges in interpreting Baroque ornamentation is that there was a degree of flexibility and subjectivity in how these ornaments were performed. While composers often provided indications for the use of ornamentation in their scores, they did not always specify exactly how the ornaments should be performed. This left room for interpretation and allowed performers to add their own personal flair and expression to the music.</p>



<p>Composers used various signs to indicate different ornaments, but there was no standardized set of ornamentation symbols. To help clarify which sign was being used for which ornament, some composers included tables of ornaments in their publications starting in the late seventeenth century (Schulenberg, 2001). One of the examples is Bach&#8217;s:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="289" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1130" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png 750w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-300x116.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-640x247.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bach, J.S. and Wolff, C. (2022) <em>Notebook for Wilhelm Friedemann Bach 1720 (Edition Peters) (German Edition)</em>. Alfred Music.</figcaption></figure>



<p>During the period between 1650 and 1750, the practice of writing ornaments as notes in music was considered detrimental to the clarity of the melodic line. J.S. Bach, in particular, was criticized for writing down the ornaments and embellishments that performers were expected to add instinctively. &#8220;He writes down in actual notes the ornaments and embellishments that performers are accustomed to supply instinctively, a habit which not only sacrifices the harmonic beauty of his music but also makes the melody totally indistinct&#8221; (Apel, 1969).</p>



<p>Overall, ornamentation was a central aspect of Baroque music, both in terms of its aesthetic and its performance practice. It was used to add interest, variety, and drama to the music, and was an important part of the composer-performer partnership of the time.</p>

<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been enjoying it more and more the cello. Actually, I think  I&#8217;m particularly drawn to low-pitched instruments like the acoustic bass, bassoon, and cello. When I learned that Schubert wrote a piece for a string quintet with a second cello instead of the usual second viola, I was curious to listen to it.</p>



<p>Listening to it was an emotional journey. The piece seemed to effortlessly shift from one mood to another. For instance, in the first movement (10:03-13:05), it transitioned from a beautiful melodic line to an intense, almost violent cello and back to the melodic line and again back to an angry mood. All this in just 3 minutes.</p>



<p>Sometimes the piece reminded me of Beethoven. For example, at the beginning of the third movement (00:00-04:03), where there is such a strength that it almost looks like an entire orchestra is playing. I think sometimes I could hear a brass instrument within the strings, and it&#8217;s amazing how Schubert was able to create such magic.</p>



<p>I think the decision to use two cellos gave the piece a full orchestral sound, especially during moments with a darker mood, such as the first movement.</p>



<p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this piece and it has sparked my interest in exploring Schubert&#8217;s other works.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As I worked through the exercises, I found that realizing figured bass was more challenging than I initially expected. While I had an understanding of harmony and chord structure, applying this knowledge to the figured bass notation required me to think more critically and pay attention to the specific intervals and chord qualities indicated by the figures.</p>



<p>Despite the initial difficulty, I found that the process of realizing figured bass became easier and more intuitive as I continued to work through the exercises. I enjoyed the process of analyzing the figures and determining the appropriate chords to use in each situation.</p>



<p>One aspect of figured bass that I found particularly appealing was the way it allows for a balance between structure and creativity. As with the counterpoint rules we studied before, there are certain conventions to follow, but there is still room to make choices. While the basic harmonic structure is provided by the figured bass symbols, the performer is given the freedom to interpret and realize those chords in a way that fits the musical context and their own artistic vision.</p>



<p>Overall, I found the process of realizing figured bass to be both challenging and rewarding. While it may not be a technique that I would use in my own music-making (does any composer use it today? I couldn&#8217;t find an answer), I can see how it could be a useful tool for composers and players in order to keep everyone on the same register. Additionally, I believe that the process of realizing figured bass has helped me to deepen my understanding of harmony and chord structure, which will undoubtedly be beneficial in my future musical endeavours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are many different ways in which instruments can be tuned, and the method used has varied throughout history and across different cultures. In Western classical music, the most commonly used tuning system is equal temperament (more specifically the 12-tone equal temperament), in which each note is separated from the next by a fixed interval known as a semitone. This system allows for the easy transposition of music and the ability to play in any key, but can sometimes result in less pure-sounding intervals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-1120" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38.jpeg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-300x225.jpeg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-768x576.jpeg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-640x480.jpeg 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-960x720.jpeg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Before the widespread use of equal temperament, other tuning systems were commonly employed. Pythagoras, in the 6th century BC, developed a tuning system based on perfect fifths with a 3:2 ratio. This system, known as Pythagorean tuning, is a form of Just Intonation that preserves the pure sound of fifths but has the drawback of producing out-of-tune thirds, which were not commonly used before the Renaissance. To address this issue, just temperament was developed.</p>



<p>During the Renaissance, the Meantone system of tuning was developed as musicians searched for new ways to experiment with tonality and harmony. It differed from the Pythagorean system in that it focused on the major third rather than the root and fifth, enabling the creation of more harmonious melodies by making dissonant notes more in tune. This system also introduced its own dissonances, known as wolf intervals.</p>



<p>In the Meantone temperament, the octave can be divided into more than 12 pitches, producing distinct pitches for notes like G♯ and A♭. Some keyboard instruments were designed to accommodate these additional pitches.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>During the Baroque era, &#8220;well-tempered&#8221; systems became popular. These tuning systems slightly adjust the intervals between the pitches of an instrument to optimize its performance in a specific key or range of keys. The tunings of the notes are not perfectly aligned with a particular scale, like equal temperament, but rather are adjusted to produce more pleasant melodies and harmonies in a particular key or set of keys. This allows for greater flexibility and expressiveness in music, as different keys can have their own unique tonal characteristics.</p>



<p>In the early 20th century, Czech composer Alois Hába introduced microtonal music, a new tuning system featuring intervals smaller than a semitone. This system allows for more complex and interesting harmonies, but requires specialized instruments and can be challenging for musicians trained in equal temperament to play.</p>



<p>This is just a brief overview of Western tuning systems. In other parts of the world, other systems have been used. For instance, Indian classical music frequently employs just intonation, with the addition of shruti, intervals smaller than those normally found between notes, similar to cents in Western music (<em>Microtones in Indian Classical Music</em>, no date). In the modern Arab tone system, the octave is divided into 24 equal intervals known as quarter tones. The specific notes used in a piece belong to one of more than seventy modes or maqam rows.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This turned out harder than I thought. The process of writing the numbers of the figured bass is slower than realising the figured bass. After checking against the solution, I realised I made several mistakes as shown below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="254" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-1024x254.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1104" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-1024x254.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-300x74.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-768x191.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-1536x381.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-2048x508.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-640x159.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-960x238.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">First attempt</figcaption></figure>



<p>I forgot the F# in the first bar and missed the 4+. Strangely, bar 3 has the same first chord, but I added a # to it. Clearly, there was a lack of attention.</p>



<p>That first chord in bar 3 is a 7th chord, so the 4+ should replace the lonely #.</p>



<p>Likewise, I forgot to add the b to the Ab chord. As well as the chords in bar 4 where I did not add the accidentals.</p>



<p>There is only one question I have left. The solution did not contain figured bass in the second note in bar 3. How much should be written?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This exercise was fun because it allowed me to experiment with different chord voicings and try to incorporate some voice-leading and melodic shapes. As I experimented with different spacings, I noticed that closer chords sounded muddier, whereas spread chords were much sharper and more detailed. I used these spread chords to add punctuation to certain parts of the composition, such as in bar 6.</p>

<p>I recently became a fan of Caroline Shaw after listening to her Partita for 8 Singer. I have since listened to some of her other songs, including &#8220;To the Sky,&#8221; which features Shaw&#8217;s exceptional vocals and the talented musicianship of the exploratory New York ensemble Sō Percussion. The lyrics for the song are taken from Anne Steele&#8217;s 18th-century hymnal, the Sacred Harp.</p>



<p>The song starts off with a gentle hum and softly rumbling marimba, gradually increasing in intensity and culminating in Shaw&#8217;s powerful vocals. Shaw&#8217;s music often showcases a dynamic range and the versatility of the voice as an instrument.</p>



<p>In addition to Shaw&#8217;s vocals, Sō Percussion&#8217;s expert use of percussion instruments creates a rich and complex soundscape that perfectly complements Shaw&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>After a gentle start, the song builds to a climax with exuberance and then fades away, leaving me with a sense of awe and wonder.</p>



<p>Overall, &#8220;To the Sky&#8221; is a beautiful and moving piece of music that has left me wanting to hear more from Shaw.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Because of Project 3.0, I started listening to Händel&#8217;s Dixit Dominus&#8217; first movement and ended up listening to the entire work. </p>



<p>Georg Friedrich Händel was a German-born composer (1685 &#8211; 1759) who worked in Germany, and Italy and settled in London. He was heavily influenced by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition and the Italian Baroque style. Händel&#8217;s music is considered a pinnacle of the &#8220;high baroque&#8221; style and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of his era.</p>



<p>Dixit Dominus is a psalm setting completed in 1707 and is scored for an SSATB choir and soloists, strings and continuo. </p>



<p>Although I enjoyed the entire piece, I found the first movement to be the most interesting and surprising. As a psalm, I was expecting a contemplative and loving sound. Instead, I found it to be rough and even a bit hostile. This was due to the rhythmic vitality which felt a lot like a warlike snare.</p>



<p>It is not surprising that the piece&#8217;s opening movement evokes a warlike sound, given the psalm&#8217;s theme about God giving the king of Israel the power to defeat his enemies (Clássicos dos Clássicos, 2019).</p>



<p>The ending of Dominus a dextris tuis is another example of the power of the choir, as it resembles a war chant. I imagine this would likely have been striking to an audience in the 1700s, given the religious context in which it was performed.</p>



<p>The choir in this piece reminded me of Caroline Shaw&#8217;s Partita for 8 Voices. I believe that they are similar in their exploration of different vocal timbers and ranges, either together or in counterpoint. Additionally, the staccato rhythm of the voices in both pieces creates an almost drum-like feeling.</p>

<p>Richard Strauss (1864-1949), a child prodigy with exceptional musical aptitude, composed two symphonies and concertos for horn and violin by the time he was twenty years of age. He hailed from Munich and was the son of Franz Strauss, a celebrated horn player who held Mozart, Beethoven, and Haydn in high esteem as his &#8220;musical trinity&#8221; (Kennedy, 2006).</p>



<p>In 1874, he attended the Ludwigsgymnasium where he studied music theory with Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer, conductor of the Munich Court Orchestra. During his studies with Meyer, Strauss learned about Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn and other classical composers.</p>



<p>By the time Strauss was 18, he had already written around 150 pieces in a conservative style that resembled Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. But at 21, he began to rebel against this traditional sound.</p>



<p>In 1885, he moved to Meiningen to work with Hans von Bülow, a renowned conductor. He learnt about opera from Brahms and perfected his conducting technique, while being exposed to the two main currents of Germanic music at the time. Those advocating &#8220;pure music&#8221; (e.g., Joachim, Hanslick) hailed Brahms&#8217; music and opposed those who propagated &#8220;music of the future&#8221; (e.g., Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner) (Malheiros dos Santos, 2018).</p>



<p>Strauss met Alexander Ritter (1833-1896), a composer and violinist in the Meiningen Orchestra, who had an immense influence on him. An avid follower of Wagner, Ritterer shifted Strauss&#8217; focus from abstract works towards modern orchestral works inspired by literature. This was despite his father&#8217;s disapproval of Wagner&#8217;s music. In 1889, Strauss completed his first mature masterpiece Don Juan (Dotsey, 2019).</p>



<p>The idea behind composing Don Juan was born in 1885, during a performance of Paul Heyse&#8217;s Don Juans Ende in Frankfurt. However, Strauss&#8217; direct source was an incomplete poem from 1851 written by Nicolaus Lenau. In contrast to the classic conception of Don Juan as a rake and impostor, Lenau portrayed him as an idealist searching for ultimate love, eventually becoming discontented with himself.</p>



<p>In his composition of Don Juan, Strauss focused on the individual pursuit of an idealised form of love that perpetually eludes him. This is expressed musically through a continuous rise and fall in emotion that culminates in the protagonist&#8217;s demise by duel.</p>



<p>Strauss wrote Don Juan for a large instrumental ensemble consisting of 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes and English horn, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons and contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, cymbals, glockenspiel, harp, and strings.</p>



<p>Strauss&#8217; structure of Don Juan mirrors the story told by Nikolaus Lenau, beginning with a presentation of the protagonist, followed by two episodes of love affairs and an orgiastic scene which leads to a duel with Don Pedro resulting in his (assumed) death.</p>



<p>At the outset of this piece, Strauss employs the whole orchestra to create a boisterous, heroic rising pattern which adds vigour and propulsion to the main theme.</p>



<p>The initial scene (beginning at 00:56 of the recording I listened to) appears to be the introduction of Don Juan&#8217;s initial conquest and romantic relationship with a woman. There is a duet between the violins (woman) and horns and cello (Don Juan), that culminates in a very interesting and surprising dark climax at G.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="456" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08-456x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1057" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08-456x1024.png 456w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08-134x300.png 134w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08-300x674.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></figure>



<p>The second scene (at 05:32) appears to be another conquest by Don Juan, suggesting a greater emotional connection this time. The plaintive flute and especially the endearing oboe melody are employed to convey the ardour of his love. This sentiment ultimately reaches a triumphant high point as the horns play the heroic theme.</p>



<p>The carnival scene (at 10:27) functions as a transitional section as it spirals out of control. It starts with tranquil strings, but quickly gains intensity and creates an intense atmosphere. As the scene progresses, Strauss juxtaposes various iterations of Don Juan&#8217;s theme on top of one another.</p>



<p>The fight scene (at 15:00) maintains the tension built in the preceding scene, ending suddenly to echo Don Juan&#8217;s death at the hands of Don Pedro.</p>



<p>The death scene (at 15:37) is an understated and sorrowful conclusion with the bassoons giving Don Juan a final breath.</p>



<p>Listening to the full piece is clear that Strauss uses the full orchestra and its individual timbres to express Don Juan&#8217;s emotional journey to the audience. At the start, he is portrayed as audacious and confident through sweeping arpeggios and complex orchestration. His love stories are tender and romantic, with Strauss employing range, colour and instrumentation to illustrate the character&#8217;s humanity. He accentuates Don Juan&#8217;s boldness through powerful instruments such as brass while utilising woodwinds to depict his insecurities.</p>



<p>Strauss&#8217; use of dynamics is a notable feature in his composition of Don Juan. As an example, it ranges between ff and fff only for woodwinds, horns, and strings in the A. Another example is the beautiful slow movement in L, which ranges from p to ppp. In addition to conveying the storyline to the listener, this creates an interesting contrast that prevents the music from becoming monotonous.</p>



<p>The exact structure of Don Juan has been a source of detective work for the past century, with the piece being described by some as a free sonata and by others as either a rondo or a fusion between the two (Hepokoski, 1997). Nonetheless, it is clear that Strauss wanted to move away from conventional structures.</p>



<p>Romantic-era composers sought more open ways to express their musical ideas, instead of the strict forms used by classical composers (i.e. Haydn&#8217;s sonata form). With this newfound freedom, they could employ melody, harmony and texture to evoke a narrative, a character or an atmosphere; thus new genres such as Programme Music, Concert Overture and Symphonic Poem were created.</p>



<p>In the collection of his thoughts, Recollections and Reflections, edited by biographer Willi Schuh, Strauss voiced his support for these novel orchestral forms. He stated that “New ideas must seek out new forms for themselves: the basic principle adopted by Liszt in his symphonic works, in which the poetic idea really did act simultaneously as the structural element, became from then onwards the guideline for my own symphonic works.” (Strauss and Schuh, 1974).</p>



<p>Strauss was aware of the pioneering progressions in Programme Music from Liszt, a pianist who revolutionised programme music with his novel genre, the symphonic poem.</p>



<p>The term &#8216;symphonic poem&#8217; describes a programmatic work composed for an orchestra which draws inspiration from a range of outside sources, such as poems, stories and artwork. This style of composition was adopted to meet nineteenth-century aesthetic objectives; by relating music to something non-musical, allowing multiple movements to be combined into one section and raising instrumental program music up to the same level as opera (Macdonald, 2001).</p>



<p>In addition, composers of symphonic poems had the freedom to alter the stories and characters, as Strauss appears to do with Don Juan. It remains uncertain whether he is faithful to Lenau&#8217;s representation, or if he uses melodic themes and orchestral colouring to suggest a character who is more actively engaged with life rather than one who is jaded. This could be described as the enchantment of romanticism in art, expressed by their search for unlimited possibilities in composition which allows listeners to enter into a realm of introspection and imagination rather than being restricted by form.</p>



<p>Strauss also drew much influence from Wagner, particularly in terms of chromaticism, harmonic structures, and the use of leitmotifs. In his composition of Don Juan, this is evident through the varied orchestration and gradual evolution of motifs to evoke drama and emotion. These musical ideas effectively convey the psychological nature of its characters.</p>



<p>It wasn’t just the piece’s structure and the use of the motifs that made Don Juan innovative. The piece demands great technical virtuosity from its performers in terms of range, breath control and virtuosic execution, as in A. This is emblematic of the Romantic era which sought to develop great technical virtuosity.</p>

<p>In summary, Richard Strauss&#8217;s Don Juan is a remarkable example of Program Music from the Romantic era. It displays his aptitude in utilizing various musical elements to convey the protagonist’s inner world whilst simultaneously stirring emotions in its listeners. Through the incorporation of leitmotifs, chromaticism and technically challenging orchestral parts, Strauss has produced a sophisticated and powerful composition that reflects music’s capacity to narrate stories.</p>

<p>Les Préludes is a symphonic poem composed by Franz Liszt and premiered in 1854. His symphonic poem is one of his most famous compositions and is often seen as an example of the genre. This work is based on a poem by Alphonse de Lamartine of the same name that explores ideas of fate and destiny. Liszt uses a variety of musical devices to illustrate Lamartine&#8217;s poem, including changes in tempo and dynamics, harmonic shifts, and orchestral colour.</p>



<p>Liszt&#8217;s use of thematic transformation in Les Préludes is one of the most striking aspects of the work. Thematic transformation is a compositional technique whereby a musical theme is altered or transformed in order to create a distinct idea or mood. In Les Préludes, Liszt uses this technique to great effect, transforming the main theme of destiny into several different musical ideas that represent different aspects of the poem.</p>



<p>Beginning with three notes (C-B-E), the piece is a dreamy introduction. In a thematic transformation, this motif will be repeated throughout the work. Using this single motif, the music moves from a dawn of enchantment to a tumultuous battle to a triumphant ending.</p>



<p>My first experience listening to Liszt&#8217;s Les Préludes was incredibly moving. With Liszt&#8217;s use of thematic transformation, I could really feel the tension that he had created, although sometimes it was challenging to discern where the main theme was. I really like this piece of music.</p>

<p>Luís de Freitas Branco was a Portuguese composer, musicologist, and professor of music who played a pre-eminent part in developing Portuguese music in the first half of the 20th century. He wrote over 150 pieces of music, including orchestral works, chamber music and works for the stage, as well as songs and choral works. Suite Alentejana No. 1 is one of his most famous works and is known for its energetic rhythms, colourful orchestration and vibrant melodies.</p>



<p>The piece is written for a large orchestra with 3 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, castanets and harp, as well as strings.</p>



<p>Luís de Freitas Branco&#8217;s Suite Alentejana No. 1, written in 1919, is a celebrated work that demonstrates his preference for the Alentejo region of Portugal. Personally, the third and final movement, known as the Fandango, stands out for its vibrant energy and eloquent orchestration. It is written for orchestra with elements of folk music from Alentejo such as a binary-metered rhythm and castanets incorporated into the piece. The form of the piece is tripartite (A-B-A), with an English horn solo leading to a choral section in between two energised sections featuring returning themes. As we close the Fandango brilliantly, the exuberance and vigour of the first section return.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Maria João Pires&#8217; performance was the first I heard. The dynamic range is quite wide and there is a lot of rubato. It seems that she plays faster prior to the louder dynamics and slower prior to the quieter markings. The performance becomes less monotonous and more interesting as a result.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Like Maria João Pires, Rubinstein uses a lot of rubato, especially on the highest notes. In his performance, he sustains high notes subtly to create a more dramatic effect. In spite of the short dynamic range in the Agitato, the last section is intense and played with an astonishing force.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>I listened to Nakamura&#8217;s live performance. During the performance there was a lot of use of rubato, moving faster and slower several times within a short period of time. The first ornaments are played very slowly, compared to other performances, and she doesn&#8217;t completely stop at the fermatas. As a whole, I feel like a lot of creative liberties were taken during the performance regarding speed.</p>

<p>This recording by Lisiecki is the one that follows the score more closely. Particularly the stacatto at the end of the main phrase. It was the only performer I listened to who played stacatto and it opened my eyes to a new perspective. Throughout the piece there is very little rubato nor a lot of variation in dynamics, making it less dramatic than other performances.</p>

<p>Foderova&#8217;s performance is very intense. Maybe because it&#8217;s a live performance. A lot of that intensity comes from the rubato and some creative liberties she takes with the score, but mainly from her pauses. She uses dramatic pauses, especially at the end of the Agitato, which lasts for almost six seconds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Every artistic form that requires performers, such as theatre, cinema, dance, or music, always raises the question: how&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Every artistic form that requires performers, such as theatre, cinema, dance, or music, always raises the question: how personal should a performance be? Should the interpretation of written art be faithful to the author&#8217;s intentions? Does it make sense to contextualize old works to the era in which they were performed? Is there a set of rules to follow? If so, does that make a performance authentic? What is authenticity?</p>



<p>There are many questions when it comes to Performance Practice. I won&#8217;t be able to answer all of them, but I&#8217;ll try to answer &#8220;What is Performance Practice?&#8221;, &#8220;What factors should a performer consider when interpreting a score?&#8221; and &#8220;What makes a good performance?&#8221;.</p>



<p>The field of Performance Practice or Historical Informed Practice studies performance (Rile, 2014), specifically how performance was practised in the past. In general, it focuses on works from the 18th century and earlier that have no contemporary recordings. In order to make an informed interpretation of a piece, a performer should take into account that music reflects the culture of the place where it was composed. In addition to its composer&#8217;s personality, it reflects the values of its society at the time the piece was composed and the instruments available.</p>



<p>A successful performance practice involves a number of factors inherent to the music, including sound, physical space, tuning and temperament, articulation, tempo, and dynamics (Duffin, 2017).</p>



<p>Sound, for instance, describes how instruments sounded at the time of composition. Many instruments have changed since then. Some don&#8217;t exist anymore, and others weren&#8217;t invented until the 18th century (such as the piano). Therefore, when choosing instruments to play, the performer must consider the sound the composer intended.</p>



<p>Dynamic and tempo are also examples. It is usually up to the interpreter to decide what those indications in the scores mean. In terms of tempo, metronomes weren&#8217;t invented until the 19th century, so pieces written before that can&#8217;t be gauged concretely. In fact, there is some debate about whether Bach&#8217;s music has been played faster or slower over time (Niles, 2018). Similarly, dynamics are ambiguous. A forte or piano can mean something different to different performers or even to different venues.</p>



<p>A historically informed performance is also influenced by factors that are extrinsic to music. This includes the social and political context, the piece&#8217;s commission, and the venue where it was to be performed. Factors such as these can help determine intrinsic musical characteristics.</p>



<p>In the end, the most influential factor is the personality of the performer, which influences the interpretation of the piece greatly. Without a performer&#8217;s interpretation, all performances of a piece would sound the same. It is my belief that most composers would not wish to remove that human trait from a performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All arts are human by definition. As a result, such arts will always feature interpretation, improvisation, adaptation, contextualization, ambition, and imagination. Ultimately, what makes a&nbsp;good&nbsp;performance, and specifically good performance practice, will come down to the performer&#8217;s&nbsp;good&nbsp;judgment.</p>

<p>Sonata in D Major, TWV 44:1 is a piece of Baroque music composed by the German composer Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767). It combines elements of concerto and suite genres and is composed for trumpet, strings, and basso continuo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three movements make up the piece, each with its own distinctive character. In Sinfonia Spirituoso, the opening trumpet fanfare presents a lively and energetic start. The second movement, Largo, displays two violins in intimate harmony with the basso continuo. With its lively tempo and energetic tone, the closing movement Vivace brings the piece to a triumphant conclusion.</p>



<p>I found it to be a captivating work of Baroque music with an interesting and multifaceted composition. The opening fanfare immediately captivated me with its bold and triumphant sound.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Some claim that the world is gradually becoming united, that it will grow into a brotherly community as distances shrink and ideas are transmitted through the air. Alas, you must not believe that men can be united in this way.</p><cite>Fyodor Dostoevsky,&nbsp;<em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>&nbsp;(1880)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Globalisation is “a term that describes a new era of human communication and interconnection across cultural, national, and geographic boundaries” (Beaster-Jones, 2013). In other words, it refers to a growing relationship between culture, economy, and people, with an emphasis on the economic side. In this text, cosmopolitanism and globalisation must be distinguished. The first one is a socioeconomic force that strives to homogenize consumption. The second is a personal attitude towards embracing diversity and humanizing it (Petriglieri, 2016).</p>



<p>A modern concept of globalisation might have started with the Roman Empire, which interconnected the world (part of it, to be precise), leading to easier mobility (Bora &amp; Bonelli, 2019). Globalisation was made truly global around the 16th century when the relationship between countries such as Portugal, Spain, India and China intensified (Flynn &amp; Giraldez, 2007). As transportation became easier, safer, and faster, cultures, thoughts, and rituals clashed more frequently in various aspects of society in the 17th and 18th centuries. Culture and music were not exceptions, as music is inherently social.</p>



<p>Globalisation during the romantic period was caused by three factors. First of all, the decrease in aristocracy patronage broadened audiences and gave the artist more room for experimentation with novel sounds, techniques, and instruments. Secondly, artists became more virtuosic and self-expressive, leading to a fusion of their cultural roots with traditional and local music, creating new sounds. Bartók and Chopin, for instance, are known for incorporating folk songs from their birth countries into their music. Lastly, the mobility of artists. Artists (and audiences) have become less limited by time and space and were able to interact across many locations. Apart from the increase in world fairs and music festivals that attracted worldwide audiences, music tourism and travel allowed artists to experience new cultures and be inspired by them.</p>



<p>As a result of increased globalisation, artists experimented more and audiences were predisposed to exploring different sounds, new formats, and new instruments. This resulted in even broader experimentation during the modernist era, which influenced modern music in the 20th century. If artists and audiences weren&#8217;t inclined to merge cultures and experiment with new sounds, genres like blues, jazz, rock, K-pop and reggaeton wouldn&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>Even though society and music have made remarkable advances, there are some concerns about globalisation. A major concern is the loss of individuality. Cultural homogenization is a risk associated with globalisation, and there is a fear that the individuality and identity of a group will be lost in an effort to incorporate other cultural settings (Back, 2012). There is also concern about undue cultural appropriation, which is a more recent concern. In the context of globalisation, cultural appropriation is unavoidable. However, a question arises as to how we can use other cultures&#8217; proprieties and what processes are legitimate so that we can increase contact between cultures (Choufan, 2021).</p>



<p>In my opinion, all advances in technology are preparing society for increased globalisation. With the advent of streaming music platforms, social networks, and cheap travel, it&#8217;s more common to see the effects of globalisation, such as multi-country genres (K-Pop) or mixed-background bands (The Foreign Exchange and Superorganism). In the future, globalisation may turn into glocalisation (Roudometof, 2016) in which instead of cultural homogenization, local cultures will adapt global phenomena into their own traditions. This can be seen today, where there is a widening diversity of consumption of Spotify and iTunes in different countries than ever before (Bello &amp; Garcia, 2021).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Wagner took around 26 years to complete the Ring Cycle, which consists of four German-language epic music dramas&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Wagner took around 26 years to complete the Ring Cycle, which consists of four German-language epic music dramas lasting about 16 hours. Although the briefing asked for a 500-word essay, I found it challenging to condense such a monumental cycle to that length. The result was a longer text. I watched Opera North&#8217;s performance of The Ring Cycle.</p>



<p>“The Nibelungen Myth as Sketch for a Drama” was Wagner’s first prose sketch in 1848, which sparked his interest in the project. When Wagner began writing the poem (the libretto) for Siegfried’s Death (which became Götterdämmerung), he noticed that the heroic Siegfried had to be described in much more detail and clarity. By working backwards, he crafted Siegfried’s heroic youth story. Siegfried’s parentage and the family history of the Wälsungs are told in Die Walküre. Additionally, Wagner wanted to show how Alberich (the Nibelung dwarf) forged the ring of power from the Rhinegold. The story had been written from end to beginning, and now the music would be composed from beginning to end. In November 1874, the final score for The Ring was completed (Hoover, n.d.).</p>



<p>In Wagner’s vision, this cycle would be set at a festival and performed over three days and one evening. Historically, Wagner had been fascinated by Greek tragedy for some time, and the concept of this opera was a logical fit with those ideals (Hoover, n.d.).</p>



<p>Wagner considered this to be not just a musical composition, but an experience. He introduced the term ‘gesamtkunstwerk’, which means “total work of art”, in two essays in 1849: Art and Revolution and The Artwork of the Future. His goal was to reunite the most common forms of art – music, drama, poetry, and staging (Krause, 2020).</p>



<p>During the development of this opera, he developed much larger orchestras, invented new instruments (the Wagner Tuba was created by him), and took the staging to an entirely unprecedented level. In all likelihood, he was the one who pushed for the lights to be turned down and the drama played in the dark to ensure a better viewing experience (Huizenga &amp; Daugert, 2008). His obsessive specifications led him to build a radically redesigned theatre in Bayreuth, Germany. In doing so, he forever changed the landscape of musical theatre.</p>



<p>In terms of music, this cycle is notable for its use of leitmotifs (over sixty in total). While leitmotifs existed before Wagner, he used them creatively, altering keys, upside down, mixing them together, and more (Midgette, 2021). His music became a narrator and participant in the action, instead of just acting as an accompanist.</p>



<p>This led to the idea of a talking orchestra (Midgette, 2021). It was Wagner’s desire for the orchestra to function like the chorus of a Greek tragedy, predicting, showing, and commenting on what happens. This required sixty-four stringed instruments, four times as many wind instruments, and more prominence for the brass section than was common at the time.</p>



<p>All this grandiosity led to an enormous challenge for the singers. In addition to the length of the opera, the greatest challenge for the singers was to make themselves heard over such a powerful orchestra. The technical difficulty of singing these operas has given rise to the term Wagnerian voice: a voice that is substantial, dense in tone, extremely powerful, and ideally evenly balanced throughout.</p>



<p>Personally, I was most impressed by the amount of work Wagner put into The Ring Cycle. The more research I do, the more I realize how innovative and impactful his work was for our music. By using the orchestra as a storyteller, the music feels a lot like a soundtrack for a movie, very similar to what contemporary composers compose for movies today. It is clear now why composers like Korngold cite Wagner as an inspiration (Ross, 2020).</p>



<p>The development of the characters was another thing I liked. There is no clear line between good and evil. All characters have strengths and flaws, akin to Game Of Thrones and less to Lord Of The Rings. This makes them more human (even Gods) and complex, and the music reflects this.</p>



<p>On the negative side, I felt overwhelmed. Too much is happening all the time, with too many leitmotifs, plots, and themes. It’s true that the leitmotifs appear again and again during the operas, but there isn’t much sense of repetition that makes the ears rest from the continuous novelty. There is almost an impression that Wagner wanted to show all of his virtuosity in one work and to develop his ideas as much as possible. However, it’s always a good idea to remember that less is more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve been reading the book Dilla Time, about the life of James DeWitt Yancey, better known as J Dilla and Jay Dee. He was an American record producer, drummer, rapper, songwriter, and rapper. It is Dilla&#8217;s &#8220;drunk&#8221;, and &#8220;laid back&#8221; time-feel that makes his work unique and difficult to interpret, define, or translate. His production style has inspired some of the world&#8217;s most renowned pop, hip-hop, and jazz musicians &#8212; achieved, in part, because he didn&#8217;t quantize his music (Fitzpatrick, 2011).</p>



<p>While I don&#8217;t listen to a lot of hip-hop, I was intrigued by his stories and how he blew everyone away with his eccentric rhythms, so I decided to check out some of the music he produced or composed (Stadnicki, 2017). My favourite was Running by The Pharcyde, released in 1995.</p>



<p>It begins with a simple maracas sample from James Moody, followed by acoustic guitar from Luiz Bonfá. As I listen to these samples, I realize that the tempo is not always right. I start to understand why people talk about J Dilla when the drums start playing. It seems like the kick drum is rushing (perhaps running?) while the snare is dragging after the hi-hats. This results in strangely relaxed music, with an endless forward motion.</p>



<p>These kinds of not quantized drum sounds are somehow normal nowadays and explored by a lot of musicians, but I can imagine how refreshing it was to listen to such a relaxed and “humanized” beat after listening to so much on-tempo electronic music from the late ’80s and early ’90s.</p>

<p>“Letter from Home” is a composition by American composer Aaron Copland, written in 1944 and commissioned as a patriotic work by Paul Whiteman for his Radio Hall of Fame Orchestra. The piece is a reflection on the experiences of soldiers returning home from war, and the changes that they have undergone during their time away. The piece is written in the style of a letter from a soldier to his family and conveys the bittersweet emotions of coming home after having seen the horrors of war.</p>



<p>The piece begins with a sombre, reflective melody, as the soldier reflects on his experiences and considers the changes that have taken place in his life since departing. The music slowly builds to a more upbeat, hopeful tone, as the soldier finds comfort in the thought of being reunited with his family and friends. The piece ends with a triumphant, joyous melody, as the soldier celebrates the joy of being home. The instrumentation is sparse and haunting, evoking a sense of loneliness and longing.</p>



<p>Ultimately, “Letter from Home” is a powerful and poignant tribute to the soldiers who have sacrificed so much for their country. Through its emotional intensity and evocative musical language, Copland captures the complex emotions of a soldier returning home.</p>

<p>Keith Jarrett is a celebrated American jazz musician and composer. He has been active since the 1960s and has released several acclaimed albums, such as My Song, which came out in 1978. His music often features a sublime simplicity and directness that has made it a favorite among jazz enthusiasts.</p>



<p>The title track of Keith Jarrett&#8217;s 1978 album, My Song, is a timeless piece featuring the collaborative efforts of the European Quartet. The melody is introduced by a pensive piano movement that is soon joined by Jan Garabek&#8217;s saxophone and Jon Christensen&#8217;s percussion, which uses shakers and cymbals to create a soft and muted backdrop. Over the years, My Song has become a popular standard among jazz musicians, with Pat Metheny being one of its most notable interpreters.</p>

<p>Symphonie Fantastique, one of Hector Berlioz&#8217;s most well-known compositions, was composed in 1830. After winning the Prix de Rome, the composer spent fifteen months in Italy between 1831 and 1832, and this experience is especially evident in Harold in Italy. Berlioz preferred the Abruzzi mountains over the academy&#8217;s environment, concerts, and operas in Rome (Bynog et al., 2021).</p>



<p>After Paganini’s commission of Harold in Italy, Berlioz finished it in 1834, not only recalling his experience in Italy as an inspiration for the programmatic structure of this symphony but also drawing inspiration from Lord Byron’s popular poem Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage. This resulted in Berlioz utilizing descriptive titles for each movement and the corresponding programmatic nature of the music since he was aiming for writing “a musical impression of the archetypal romantic hero” (Clements, 2001):</p>



<ul><li>Harold in the mountains</li><li>Procession of the Pilgrims Singing Their Evening Prayer</li><li>Serenade</li><li>The Orgy of the Brigands</li></ul>



<p>Unifying all these movements is the solo instrument: the viola. In his plan, Berlioz envisaged “a series of orchestral scenes in which the viola would be involved […] like an actual person, retaining the same character throughout”. That character would be “a melancholy dreamer in the&nbsp;style of Byron’s Childe Harold” (Deller, 2019).</p>



<p>The most interesting thing is that, facing a plan like this, a composer would be compelled to write strong, loud and bold viola lines in every movement, making the instrument and the player shine. But Berlioz took another approach. In order to create a character like Harold, he made the viola gentle, shy, and quiet. It is the orchestra that can sometimes be loud, rough, and strong.</p>



<p>I was struck by the instruction to play the viola as softly as possible &#8211; barely audible. This paradoxically draws more attention to the instrument. A very quiet performance requires an effort on the part of the audience to be able to hear it. The viola player, however, needs to be highly skilled, since it is more difficult to play loudly than softly. For the sound intensity to be maintained along the bow&#8217;s full length, the performer&#8217;s stance must be firmly grounded with solid shoulders and right arm stability (Bathurst, 2016).</p>



<p>This piece was written in the aftermath of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic devastation and trauma, when society was deciding whether to be ruled by a charismatic leader of a totalitarian or by a humane, humble and compassionate leader (Bathurst, 2016). As a humanitarian (Klein, 1969), I believe Berlioz used the viola as a symbol of the latter, being subtle and quiet and allowing the orchestra to shine when necessary, rather than being the solo instrument that always takes center stage. Paganini might not have realized this when he read the score, but after hearing it and watching the viola&#8217;s role, he understood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It was while researching Berlioz&#8217;s Harold in Italy that I came across an article by French violist Antoine Tamestit. This article stated, in 2015, when he played Harold with John Eliot for the first time, he told German composer Jörg Widmann how delighted he was with the piece. Therefore, Widmann composed a viola concerto filled with narration, journeys and interactions with multiple orchestral instruments.</p>



<p>Based on this description, I decided to watch Tamestit&#8217;s performance with the Frankfurt Radio Symphony conducted by Andrés Orozco-Estrada.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Widmann: Viola Concerto ∙ hr-Sinfonieorchester ∙ Antoine Tamestit ∙ Andrés Orozco-Estrada" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_5WraTt_l_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>My overall reaction was one of awe and I still don&#8217;t know if I liked it or not. However, I believe that was the purpose of this concerto. In one interview, Tamestit explains that this piece is intended to disorient the listener (Todes, 2021). While I sometimes understood what the composer was saying, other times I felt disoriented and I wondered if it wasn&#8217;t just too much theatrical for show&#8217;s sake.</p>



<p>In the same interview, Tamestit talks about how the instrumentation is unusual. This concerto, for instance, requires the soloist to scream throughout and requires the pianist to hold a whiskey glass.</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t expecting such a theatrical performance with such an emphasis on the viola soloist. But as an homage or follow-up to Berlioz&#8217;s symphony, Widmann seemed to want to keep the viola at the center of this performance.</p>



<p>The viola is the focus of this piece, for me. As it takes the listener through the viola&#8217;s different sounds, blending and clashing with other instruments, and finding its place within the orchestra.</p>



<p>Berlioz&#8217;s symphony and this concerto have many connections, but for me, the biggest one is the instrument&#8217;s representation. In Harold in Italy, the viola embodied Harold, here the instrument symbolized itself. As I realized, Widmann attempted to meta-characterize the viola. And that was a brilliant idea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During this exercise, I struggled a lot, so I did some more research about transposing. I found this video by Mattia Chiappa explaining transposing with the guitar (an instrument I am more familiar with) and explaining the difference between the two steps: writing and reading. As a result, I understand better the process of transposing and was able to do the exercise more efficiently.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>My go-to book behind bars was helpful in researching the instrument order on an orchestral score.</p>



<p>I discovered that orchestral and large ensemble scores group instrumental sections in the following order: woodwinds, brass, percussion, keyboards, and strings.</p>



<p>Additionally, no matter how few staves are present within a score, instrumental staves remain in the same position.</p>



<p>Each instrument should be listed in the following order:</p>



<p>Piccolo</p>



<p>Flute</p>



<p>Oboe</p>



<p>Cor Anglais</p>



<p>Clarinet</p>



<p>Bass Clarinet</p>



<p>Saxophones</p>



<p>Bassoon</p>



<p>Contrabassoon</p>



<p>Horns</p>



<p>Trumpets</p>



<p>Trombones</p>



<p>Tuba</p>



<p>Timpani</p>



<p>Percussion</p>



<p>Harp and plucked stringed instruments</p>



<p>Keyboard instruments</p>



<p>Soloists or Choir</p>



<p>Violin I</p>



<p>Violin II</p>



<p>Viola</p>



<p>Cello</p>



<p>Contrabass</p>



<p></p>



<p>In terms of translating instruments, these are the most common languages:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>English</strong></td><td><strong>Italian</strong></td><td><strong>German</strong></td><td><strong>French</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Piccolo</td><td>Flauto piccolo or Ottavino</td><td>Kleine Flote</td><td>Petite Flute</td></tr><tr><td>Flute</td><td>Flauto</td><td>Flote or Grosse Flote</td><td>Flute or Grande Flute</td></tr><tr><td>Oboe</td><td>Oboe</td><td>Hoboe</td><td>Hautbois</td></tr><tr><td>English Horn</td><td>Corno Inglese</td><td>Englischhorn</td><td>Cor Anglais</td></tr><tr><td>Clarinet</td><td>Clarinetto</td><td>Klarinette</td><td>Clarinette</td></tr><tr><td>Bass Clarinet</td><td>Clarinetto basso</td><td>Bassklarinette</td><td>Clarinette basse</td></tr><tr><td>Bassoon</td><td>Fagotto</td><td>Fagott</td><td>Basson</td></tr><tr><td>Contrabassoon</td><td>Contrafagotto</td><td>Kontrafagott</td><td>Contrebasson</td></tr><tr><td>Horn or French Horn</td><td>Corno</td><td>Horn/Horner</td><td>Cor</td></tr><tr><td>Trumpet</td><td>Tromba</td><td>Trompete</td><td>Trompette</td></tr><tr><td>Trombone</td><td>Trombone</td><td>Posaune</td><td>Trombone</td></tr><tr><td>Tuba</td><td>Tuba</td><td>Tuba</td><td>Tuba</td></tr><tr><td>Kettle drums</td><td>Timpani</td><td>Pauken</td><td>Timbales</td></tr><tr><td>Triangle</td><td>Triangolo</td><td>Triangel</td><td>Triangle</td></tr><tr><td>Cymbals</td><td>Piatti/Cinelli</td><td>Becken</td><td>Cymbales</td></tr><tr><td>Glockenspiel</td><td>Campanelli</td><td>Glockenspiel</td><td>Jeu de timbres or Carillon</td></tr><tr><td>Harp</td><td>Arpa</td><td>Harfe</td><td>Harpe</td></tr><tr><td>Violin</td><td>Violino</td><td>Violine</td><td>Violon</td></tr><tr><td>Viola</td><td>Viola</td><td>Bratsche</td><td>Alto</td></tr><tr><td>Cello</td><td>Violoncello</td><td>Violoncello</td><td>Violoncelle</td></tr><tr><td>Contrabass</td><td>Contrabasso or Basso</td><td>Kontrabass</td><td>Contrebasse</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Upon reading Stravinsky&#8217;s quote, I understood it quite intuitively. Due to my advertising background, most of the creative challenges I faced had constraints, so this subject is dear to me. In my experience, it was the &#8220;open challenges,&#8221; those without boundaries or limitations, that were the hardest to overcome.</p>



<p>Considering I could explore the theme more, the 500-word limit felt a bit short to me. There is a lot to discuss about rules&#8217; effectiveness, human bodies and instruments as extrinsic limitations, rules&#8217; roles in AI music composition, and if there is a right amount of restriction that promotes creativity. Nevertheless, I realized that a 500-word essay about constraints needs a constraint, so I summarized my main points.</p>



<p>Throughout this essay, the word &#8220;constraint&#8221; can take on many forms, such as &#8220;rule&#8221;, &#8220;limit&#8221;, or &#8220;boundary&#8221;. In most cases, however, the meaning remains the same. A set of extrinsic and intrinsic restraints that an artist is confronted with when using a creative medium.</p>

	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Essay</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>In this quote, apart from playing with paradoxical word use, Stravinsky was saying that all creativity revolves around solving problems (<meta charset="utf-8">Harnad et al., 2008). I believe he was arguing that for creativity to reach its full potential, there must be some tension that calls for resolution. Many artists, including Mozart (Blanning, 2016), Frank Gehry (Hereld, 2013), and John Stweart (NPR, 2015), have defended the same position. Constraints and problems are essential for artists so that they can find solutions that will produce knowledge.</p>



<p>What artists develop within these limitations and rules depends on their goals and skills. Beethoven broke them (Page, 2019). Gesualdo bent them (Ross, 2011). John Cage created new ones (Savenko, 2021). However, one thing unites them all. Each of them mastered the rules before creating beyond them.</p>



<p>Even when one considers musical genres in addition to musicians, it becomes apparent that they too need rules. New musical genres are created when &#8220;socially accepted rules&#8221; are set over the traditional ones (Fabbri, 1980). There is always a cycle: established rules are mastered; then they are questioned; then new rules are developed.</p>



<p>This was evident when monophonic masses were replaced by polyphonic ones. It was a breaking of the rules of a single melodic line that led to the establishment of new rules by the church at the Trent Council and mastered by Palestrina (Monson, 2002). During the 16th Century, these formal rules led to a strictness in compositional technique, which ultimately led to not only a controlled, contemplative, and accessible sound, but also one that was predictable and standardized. By no means am I arguing that the rules were demeaning the music, but they were purely a necessity for the Church to standardize music during the Renaissance (Mock, 2017), which was a time of profound creative and cultural shifts.</p>



<p>To assist composers in learning these contrapuntal compositional techniques of the 16th Century, Johann-Joseph Fux authored in 1725 the Gradus ad Parnassum, during a time when composers refused &#8220;to be bound by any rules or principles&#8221; (Fux et al., 1971). They are known as species counterpoint and have been a part of the learning of Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn (Norman, nd) and my own learning as well.</p>



<p>To learn and implement these rules, I found it most helpful to understand the &#8220;why&#8221; behind them. For example, understanding why consecutive fifths and octaves, and unison passages can render the music too dull and boring makes it easier to remember than simply telling me &#8220;do not use successive fifths and octaves, or unison passages&#8221;. As well as this, I relied on the progressive learning method, where one learns by doing (Kennedy, 2019). This made learning easier by increasing the difficulty one step at a time and letting my mind become accustomed to the rules as I progressed.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the rules and constraints proved to be beneficial to me, as they helped me learn different harmonization and melodic concepts, and proved effective since I was able to compose much faster than I would without them. They also proved useful in helping me become more creative as I learned to solve some musical problems and maybe even come up with new ones in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On the Academic Music Discord server, someone posted a video about Omar Thomas, a composer I had never heard of before.</p>



<p>A composer, arranger and educator, Omar Thomas was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1984. His parents are Guyanese, and he moved to Boston in 2006 to pursue a Master of Music degree at New England Conservatory.</p>



<p>A piece written for a wind ensemble, Piano and Drum Set, Come Sunday celebrates the Hammond organ&#8217;s central role in black worship. The second movement, Shout!, is an energetic celebration of gospel, jazz and blues, which shows influences from Duke Wellington and Charles Mingus as well as traditional church singing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Thomas: Come Sunday | Baylor University Wind Ensemble | TMEA 2020" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSr5XurNQF8?start=407&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>In listening to Shout!, I was surprised at how energetic it was after the slow and melodic first movement. There was an instant connection for me to the rhythm of this piece, marked by brass, bass, and drums, with the repetitive woodwinds in a high register adding the necessary tension.</p>



<p>As I listened to this piece, I was reminded of 70s funk horns and woodwinds. That&#8217;s what makes this piece so beautiful. Mixing genres and decades, creating a fresh and joyful time for the listener and for the players.</p>



<p>Since I am unfamiliar with much of the new classical music, I am enjoying this opportunity to listen to contemporary composers. At the same time that I study traditional techniques, I believe this will facilitate me in understanding the paths new composers are taking.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="first-species" class="wp-block-heading">First Species</h4>



<p>Using the tips from the First Species, I created a melodic line that was always consonant and moved mostly in contrary motion.</p>

<h4 id="second-species" class="wp-block-heading">Second Species</h4>



<p>My greatest struggle came in bars 3 and 4, where I was trying to connect the melody with the given D in bar 4. Keeping with the instructions to make leaps inside the bar, I decided to leap from B to E in bar 3.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="347" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-1024x347.png" alt="" class="wp-image-899" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-1024x347.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-300x102.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-768x260.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-1536x520.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-2048x694.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-640x217.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-960x325.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 id="third-species" class="wp-block-heading">Third Species</h4>



<p>Due to the pre-given patterns in bar 4  (nota cambiata pattern) and bar 6 (double neighbour pattern) in the third species, I started this species backwards in bar 6. Even with the given patterns, I tried to maintain a fluid melodic line with no big leaps, and always respected the previous species&#8217; guidelines.</p>

<h4 id="fourth-species" class="wp-block-heading">Fourth Species</h4>



<p>Since the suspension must be resolved downwards and in consonance with the upbeat, I found this one to be the easiest species. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>As compared to the previous species, the fifth one took me a lot lI wasn&#8217;t sure how the bass and alto should harmonize with the tenor while imitating each other. Jacob Gran&#8217;s video helped me realize we should make the three-voice counterpoint as harmonically complete as possible. Thus, for example, in bar 3, the bass is supposed to imitate the tenor by going from D to F, but that would be dissonant. The right choice is E since it makes a C major triad.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In another Spotify discovery, I listened to a piece that I had never heard before. My attention was immediately captured when a traditional drum kit entered playing a classic hip-hop pattern in the first 16 seconds.</p>



<p>Rock the Violin in Rhapsody. Hip-Hop is the first movement of the Violin Concerto &#8220;Rhapsody &amp; Fantasy&#8221; by Eldbjørg Hemsing and Tan Dun. Hemsing is one of the best violinists in Norway, while Tan Dun is one of the most renowned conductors and composers that lives in New York but was born in China.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-issuu wp-block-embed-issuu"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Having found a score for this concerto, I discovered that it includes a strong percussion section with five players, in addition to woodwinds, brass, and strings. It&#8217;s easy to hear the rhythm throughout this piece since it&#8217;s very heavy on it.</p>



<p>My favourite aspect of the piece was the constant play between rhythmic, hip-hop ambient and the almost wild solo violin. The play kept the piece alive and prevented it from becoming monotonous, which could happen with a simple hip-hop beat.</p>



<p>As described by Xenia Hanusiak <a href="https://classicalvoiceamerica.org/2018/09/26/dun-links-ancient-modern-worlds-in-new-violin-work/" target="_blank">in her article</a>, the composer calls this Rhapsody and Fantasia &#8220;the perfect result&#8221; of his thirty-five years of living in New York. It is one of the most interesting pieces I have heard in a while due to its combination of street sound rhythm, classical Chinese instruments, and a harsh nordic violin.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Exercise 1.2: First species In this exercise I followed the tip given by the briefing and worked backwards,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4 id="exercise-1-2-first-species" class="wp-block-heading">Exercise 1.2: First species</h4>



<p>In this exercise I followed the tip given by the briefing and worked backwards, starting from the last bar. I followed the tip of if the cantus rises from the leading note to the tonic, then the free part falls from the second degree to the octave. From there, I went to the first bar and add an octave. Between bars 2 and 6 I mostly worked stepwise, with a 6th, 3rd, 3rd, 6th, and 6th. I then noticed a leap to get from bar 6 to 7, which didn&#8217;t sound perfect but it didn&#8217;t sound bad either.</p>



<p>In the end, when I listened to it, I found it very dull. Probably because of the mostly stepwise motion and some parallel motion, it sounded predictable. So, I decided to give it another try and start with a 5th.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="201" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-1024x201.png" alt="" class="wp-image-873" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-1024x201.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-300x59.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-768x151.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-1536x302.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-640x126.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-960x189.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1.png 2047w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Exercise 1.2 first try</figcaption></figure>



<p>I left the last two bars, erased all the rest and started with a C. From there I tried to add some contrary motion with a 3rd, 6th, 6th, 3rd and 6th. From bar 6 to 7 there&#8217;s the same leap as the previous try, but this time it sounded better. Probably because from bar 5 to 6 there is a contrary motion, or because it comes from a 3rd to 6th instead of a 6th to 6th. I&#8217;m not really sure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="201" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-1024x201.png" alt="" class="wp-image-874" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-1024x201.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-300x59.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-768x151.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-1536x302.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-640x126.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-960x189.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1.png 2047w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Exercise 1.2 second try</figcaption></figure>



<p>When I checked the sample solution I was surprised to see that my second try is exactly the same as the solution. I believe this must be because there&#8217;s a much more finite option with just 3rds and 6ths, but I was pleased to know that my effort to make a second try got me closer to what is expected from this exercise.</p>



<h4 id="exercise-1-3-second-species" class="wp-block-heading">Exercise 1.3: Second species</h4>



<p>I started this exercise as the previous one, writing the last two bars first and then moving from the first bar until the cadence.</p>



<p>In this case, I followed the tip of leaving the first downbeat with a rest to establish a pulse and started the counterpoint with an octave. From there I wrote all downbeats with consonants and the upbeats I used as passing notes, except in bar 5 because I felt that the top melody needed a higher note to get to the climax.</p>

<p>This exercise was different because some of the notes of the species melody were given. In this case it starts with a 5th that turns into a dissonance with a 4th wich I resolved down one step into a consonant 3rd. The next note was also given and I raised the melody to a 6th that suspends into a dissonant 7th and is resolved to a 6th that leads to raise one step to the final octave.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="214" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.4-1-2-1024x214.png" alt="" class="wp-image-881" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.4-1-2-1024x214.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.4-1-2-300x63.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.4-1-2-768x160.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.4-1-2-1536x320.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.4-1-2-2048x427.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.4-1-2-640x133.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.4-1-2-960x200.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.4-1-2.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This exercise was similar to the previous one, but this time with several consecutive suspensions. With the notes given, I developed the species melody following the tips of the Fourth Species and previous ones. For example, started in an octave, kept the range within the octave above, one climax only, the dissonance is resolved on step down on the weak beat and the cadence with contrary motion by step. In the end, one thing I noticed is that the species melody is very predictable between bars 5 and 8, because the P-D-R is always 4th to 3rd. I tried to change this but, with the given notes, it was impossible. I later checked the sample solution and it was the same, so I suppose it&#8217;s the only way to complete this exercise.</p>

<h4 id="exercise-1-5-imitative-counterpoint" class="wp-block-heading">Exercise 1.5: Imitative counterpoint</h4>



<p>Initially, I had difficulty understanding the exercise. It didn&#8217;t make sense to me how the motive could fit in the blank spaces. Once you understood how it worked, it became an intuitive exercise. The only thing I couldn&#8217;t figure out was how to add the dash in the lyrics in Sibelius so it appears only in the beat, rather than randomly in the bar, as it appears below. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="565" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-1024x565.png" alt="" class="wp-image-883" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-1024x565.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-300x166.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-768x424.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-1536x848.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-2048x1130.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-640x353.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-960x530.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Exercise 1.5 first exercise</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was the first time a third voice was added to the exercises. There was no change in the challenge: imitative counterpoint. I found this one easier than the previous one, despite the new voice&#8217;s increased challenge. The gaps only allowed space for imitation of the motive, so I was able to write the motive easily and then check for any counterpoint errors.</p>

<p>Max Bruch (1838-1920) is a well-known prolific German composer. During his long career, he taught, conducted, and composed. In 1911, Bruch composed the Double Concerto in E minor, Op.88. This piece was composed for his son Max Felix Bruch, who was a first-class clarinettist.</p>



<p>A review of Bruch&#8217;s Double Concerto Op.88 premiere, published in Allgemeine Musikzeitung Zeitung No. 40 (1913), called it &#8220;harmless,&#8221; &#8220;weak,&#8221; and &#8220;uninteresting&#8221; (Fifield, 1988).</p>



<p>Initially, I was intrigued by the strange combination of clarinet and viola in this Double Concerto. My impression after listening to this piece is that both instruments can very well mimic human timbres. As a result, the solo instruments have a lyrical and melodic sound. As the two solo instruments weave melodies around each other, the orchestra provides a stable backdrop.</p>



<p>The first movement of this work presents Bruch&#8217;s two solo instruments in a rather dramatic manner. In the beginning, the solo viola is boldly introduced, followed by the clarinet. Throughout the entire movement, it feels as if both instruments are having an intimate conversation.</p>



<p>Upon hearing this movement, I felt as if there was nothing shocking and nothing wrong, at least to my ears. In addition to being a conservative, Bruch was opposed to &#8216;modern madness&#8217; and &#8216;modernists&#8217; like Strauss, Reger, and Debussy (the latter he termed an &#8216;unqualified scribbler&#8217;). As a whole, I enjoyed this piece, especially the interplay between the two solo instruments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As important as the madrigal and chanson, the polyphonic setting of the Catholic Mass was the most significant&nbsp;genre during the Renaissance. Many of the greatest compositions of music have been influenced by musical settings of the Mass.</p>



<h2 id="what-makes-a-mass" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1664189473548 is-style-cnvs-block-section-heading-4 halignleft" >

		<span>What makes a Mass?</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Besides being a religious ceremony, a mass is also a genre of music. The mass, as a ceremony, is a rite of the Roman Catholic church. It is divided into three parts: introductory rites, the liturgy of the word, and the eucharistic liturgy. During this ceremony, the congregation receives bread and wine reenacting the last supper (Keep It Classical, 2021).</p>



<p>Several parts of the liturgy are either spoken, intoned or sung. Some of them, called Proper, vary according to where we are in the liturgical calendar, while others, called Ordinary, remain the same.</p>



<p>Mass as a musical genre is made up of five movements: Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, and Anus Dei sung by the choir during the Ordinary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creating musical continuity among all these different sections was the greatest formal challenge. Several solutions were developed, including repeating the same plainchant (cantus firmus) throughout. This was done well by talented Mass composers. Throughout every section, the cantus firmus is not repeated note-for-note but rather fragmented into long, sustained notes sung by the tenor.</p>



<p>Masses in the Renaissance were generally divided into two categories: those composed based on previously composed materials and those without.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"><table><thead><tr><th>Previously composed materials</th><th>Without previously composed materials</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cantus Firmus</td><td>Cyclic</td></tr><tr><td>Paraphrase</td><td>Soggetto Cavato</td></tr><tr><td>Parody</td><td>Freely Composed</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

		<span>The evolution of the Masses</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>In my research, I have found that most literature focuses on the Mass during the Renaissance period, leaving only minimal attention to the Middle Ages and even less for the following centuries. It may be due to a more uniform unity in style during the Renaissance, pushed by the church. A prominent example is Pope Gregorious&#8217; role in bringing together diverse chants into an orderly and uniform whole for the western region of the Church to use.&nbsp;Similarly, the Council of Trent called for clearer texts, simpler polyphony, and fewer melismas later on (Monson, 2002).</p>



<h5 id="before-1400" class="wp-block-heading">Before 1400</h5>



<p>The Roman Catholic Church was the only institution that could educate the populace to become literate and enforce standards of faith and morality. This was due to the barbaric invasion and collapse of the Roman Empire. This institution stood against the grit and dereliction of the Dark Ages. Throughout Western Europe, the Church played a critical role in preserving and transmitting Christian culture, which led to music composition and performance practices. Medieval music had the function of enhancing the liturgy and creating a mood of peace, which could be achieved by singing monophonic plainchant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Middle Ages Gregorian masses were sung monophonically in unison, with a focus on the Proper. A famous example of the first complete setting of the Ordinary of the Mass dates from the 14th century, Guillaume de Machaut&#8217;s La Messe de Nostre Dame.</p>



<h5 id="renaissance" class="wp-block-heading">Renaissance </h5>



<p>Between 1400 and 1600 was the main period of Mass composition, when the Mass took on its present meaning of a polyphonic setting of the entire Mass Ordinary.&nbsp; Renaissance composers regarded the Ordinary Mass as the equivalent of 18th-century composers&#8217; symphonies, or 19th-century composers&#8217; operas: the ultimate test of their talents and creativity. In this period, composers within the area of sacred music focused primarily on the forms of mass, with their multiple-movement format offering large-scale structure opportunities (Apel, 2000).</p>



<h5 id="after-1600" class="wp-block-heading">After 1600</h5>



<p>The importance of Mass composition declined after 1600. In spite of this, there were developments such as huge choirs of 32 and 48 parts (Orazio Benevoli, 1605-72) and the use of orchestras, leading to Bach&#8217;s B-minor Mass (1733-38) (Apel, 2000).</p>



<p>The mass evolved towards secularization in the 18th and 19th centuries with works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Liszt and Bruckner.</p>



<p>The 20th and 21st centuries saw composers write masses in a variety of styles, forms, and functions that were even more diverse than before (e.g. Vaughan Williams, Stravinsky, Duruflé, Britten, Rutter, Sato).</p>

<h5 id="write-a-brief-article-of-around-500-words-in-your-listening-log-about-the-connection-of-music-with-religion-mix-in-your-personal-views-with-what-you-have-discovered-through-research" class="wp-block-heading"><em>Write a brief article of around 500 words in your listening log about the connection of music with religion. Mix in your personal views with what you have discovered through research.</em></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-default"><blockquote><p>At the end of the road, music is a religion.</p><cite>(Spitzer, 2021)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>As a result of my research, it&#8217;s quite clear that music and religion have always been closely intertwined, and their impact on who we are today is massive. As a matter of fact, some advocates argue that in place of agriculture and farming, music and religion would be the main drivers of sedentary behavior for humans (Spitzer, 2021).</p>



<p>But which came first? Music or religion? I could not find anyone who could answer this question. This leaves me believing that since humans first beat sticks repeatedly against rocks, there has been a sense of spirituality as well as divinity. This, along with the quote I used to begin this text, sum up what I believe and is supported by my research: religion and music are so closely related that it&#8217;s difficult not to believe they are one and the same. 500 words are too few for me to express my view, but I&#8217;ll try to summarize it into three points.</p>



<h5 id="both-religion-and-music-alter-the-state-of-mind" class="wp-block-heading">Both religion and music alter the state of mind</h5>



<p>According to Gilbert Rouget, music can induce two types of altered state of consciousness (ASC) across all cultures, &#8216;trance&#8217; (solitude, silence, immobility, sensory) and &#8216;ecstasy&#8217; (movement, noise, sociable) (Rouget, 1985). The same applies to religion. When dancing for a long period of time, the body suffers from fatigue, hyperventilation, hypoglycaemia, and hypoglycaemia, leading to hallucinations. Overheating at raves releases endogenous opiates. When you fast and sleep less before a rave, the driving rhythms are amplified. There has been evidence of all these effects in religious traditions, from Pentecostal churches in the American Deep South to Sufi dervishes (Spitzer, 2021).</p>



<h5 id="both-religion-and-music-are-based-on-routines" class="wp-block-heading">Both religion and music are based on routines</h5>



<p>Religion is embedded in everyday life, and it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise. One of the best examples is when John Cage asked someone about their religion while in Japan.&nbsp;The answer was dance. Japanese practice Buddhist and Shinto rituals, but they don&#8217;t go to church or temple on a regular basis. It is so integrated into the culture that it appears in daily gestures and routines, undisturbed by ordinary life (Byrne, 2017). The same with music. A social organization is marked by song at nearly every point in the lives of communities, according to ethnomusicologist Alan P. Merriam—birth songs, lullabies, naming songs, toilet-training songs, puberty songs, greetings, love songs, marriage songs, clan songs, and funeral songs.</p>



<h5 id="both-religion-and-music-connect-people" class="wp-block-heading">Both religion and music connect people</h5>



<p>People turn to religion and music during hard times. There is a search for hope, connection, and optimism among people. Because of its certainty, religious thought is particularly conducive to optimism. In addition, Michael Hogg  asserts that feeling closely connected with others leads to feelings of more security, confidence, and certainty about what to expect in the social world as a result (Hogg, 2003). The same happens with music. There is no doubt that music helps us feel hopeful and secure in times of&nbsp;uncertainty, such as&nbsp;with shows like Live Aid, The Concert For New York City or Concert For Bangladesh.</p>



<p>When I attended Kendirck Lamar&#8217;s concert last time, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was watching a music concert or a worship service. As I looked at other people at the concert, they all seemed mentally altered, either in a trance or ecstatic state. They were making the same moves and singing the same lyrics. Most importantly, they all seemed connected and hopeful.</p>



<p>Was this music or religion?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During my research, I listened to masses from different periods of history, but my focus was exclusively on the Kyrie.</p>



<p><strong>Machaut: Messe de Nostra Dame: Kyrie (1365)</strong><br>(Guillaume &amp; Royllart, 2016)</p>



<p>This Ordinary of the Mass composed before 1365 is considered the earliest complete setting attributable to any single composer. The Kyrie is written in polyphony for four voices and features lots of melismas. This piece is divided into three sections, each with the same structure: polyphony &#8211; plainchant &#8211; polyphony. As far as the sound quality is concerned, I found it to be very diverse, with each voice having its own distinct characteristics, but working together to create a pleasing whole.</p>



<p><strong>Victoria: Missa O magnum mysterium: Kyrie (1592) <br></strong>(Smith &amp; de, 1997)</p>



<p>O magnum mysterium (published in 1572) became the basis for Victoria&#8217;s 1592 Mass for a four-part choir. Since this short Kyrie is in imitation polyphonic texture, the voices do not appear to have any real distinctive characteristic, but rather blend together to achieve a more common sound.</p>



<p><strong>Bach: Mass in B minor: Kyrie I (1749)<br></strong>(Herreweghe, 2011)</p>



<p>Compared to my previous two masses, this is a big difference. This work is for five voices with instrumental accompaniment, which makes a completely different sound from choral masses without accompaniment. It is evident that Bach is stepping up the masses from church music to concert music, making them suitable for a concert hall. In this polyphonic Kyrie, what I found most interesting is the way, from bar 30, the sound never settles until the last bar. The tension and expectation lasts for about 5 minutes.</p>



<p><strong>Mozart: Great Mass in C  minor K.427: Kyrie (1783)<br></strong>(Bernstein et al., 1991)</p>



<p>After listening to it, I understand why it is considered one of Mozart&#8217;s greatest works. It is a magnificent composition for two soprano soloists, a tenor and a bass, a double chorus and a large orchestra. Similarly to Bach&#8217;s mass, Mozart wanted to make the experience more performance and entertainment-based, instead of contemplative and solemn. For me, the most appealing part of this Kyrie is the soprano solo, particularly when it reaches a low Ab and jumps two octaves higher in the following measure.</p>



<p><strong>Beethoven: Mass in C Major, Op.86:I. Kyrie (1807)<br></strong>(Kampen, K.V. <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</p>



<p>Compared to the previous masses I had listened to, the texture of this Kyrie surprised me. In my opinion, Beethoven decided to compose a homophonic-based mass that heavily relied on the choir. Throughout, there is an intriguing play of dynamics, swaying up and down and conveying different emotions in a short space of time, with some parts with breathtaking soaring voices. A note about Gloria in excelsis Deo, which is one of my favourite versions I&#8217;ve heard.</p>



<p><strong>Bruckner: Mass in E minor: Kyrie (1866)<br></strong>(Parkman, 2019)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a mass that feels like a travel back in time, stripped of all instrumental accompaniment and focusing primarily on choral. The combination of choir and brass in this Kyrie really caught my attention. This created a very dramatic and mournful sound. But I was most impressed by the use of silences and the absence of sound in some parts, which gave this piece a huge hollowness.</p>

<p>As usual, my Spotify is on shuffle and today I heard some flamenco, which I am not particularly familiar with, but enjoy listening to occasionally. This song caught my attention, so I listened carefully.</p>



<p>Originally from Ciudad Real, José Almarcha is an outstanding guitarist and composer. As a student of flamenco at the Córdoba Conservatory of Music, José studied with flamenco masters including Paco Serrano and Niño de Pura. A number of dancers have been accompanied by him, including Olga Pericet, Marco Flores, and Antonio Canales. His albums have received excellent reviews and he has been hailed as one of Spain&#8217;s most promising flamenco guitarists.</p>



<p>The singer recently released Casa del Gallego, which is a farruca, a dance-centric style of flamenco characterized by sombre virtuosity, aggressive footwork, and dramatic tempo changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this song, the melody is introduced by a flamenco guitar riff, but a few seconds into the song, there&#8217;s a surprise: a trombone with a delay effect. Not a typical flamenco sound and a hint to the listener that this probably isn&#8217;t a traditional flamenco but yes, a modern view of the style.</p>



<p>Enters the piano a few seconds later. With the trombone on the bottom, the piano on top with high notes, and the flamenco guitar in the middle, the three instruments make a beautiful sonic sandwich.</p>



<p>A mellow melody is gradually introduced by the trio, along with occasional cymbal sounds.&nbsp;Still, the strumming and tapping of guitars always have a slight tension to them. Suddenly, the tension is released as the full band enters, with a Latin rhythm recognizable as flamenco, accompanied by a shoe-tapping sound, along with another surprise: an electric guitar. There is a clash between traditional and modern sounds in the music now, and I find it very appealing.</p>



<p>As the song continues, tension is built and released with more and more shoe tapping and stomping until the apotheosis.</p>



<p>It was very interesting to see how flamenco is approached in a new way. It was entertaining to watch the piece&#8217;s sudden changes in sound dynamics that are intended to be interpreted by a dancer and add drama to the performance.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A master of contrapuntal composition, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina composed 105 masses and 250 motets in the Italian&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A master of contrapuntal composition, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina composed 105 masses and 250 motets in the Italian Renaissance. A significant figure in the development of polyphony, he represented the conservatism of the 16th century on the subject of church music.</p>



<p>Though it is widely believed that Palestrina saved polyphony by himself, it is a myth that is widely accepted, although it is also true that the Council of Trent (1545-1563) stressed the importance of musical clarity and Palestrina himself advocated it (Monson, 2002).</p>



<p>Palestrina&#8217;s Missa Brevis (Short Mass) was first published in 1570 and is considered one of his most famous works. There are four voices in the Kyrie (Cantus, Altus, Tenor, and Bassus). With the exception of a brief homophonic section at the end of the second Kyrie, the texture is almost exclusively polyphonic. With a gentle melodic line and simple harmony, this piece stays in F major with only occasional chromatic changes, creating a restful, calm atmosphere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<h3 id="claudio-monteverdi-1567-1643" class="wp-block-heading">Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643)</h3>



<p>Monteverdi was an Italian composer, violinist, singer, and priest. He is often considered a revolutionary who marked the transition from Renaissance to Baroque music.</p>



<p>Until the age of forty, Monteverdi worked primarily on madrigals, composing a total of nine books. In about four years, Monteverdi completed his first book of twenty-one madrigals for five voices. Overall, the first eight madrigals show the massive development from Renaissance polyphonic to baroque monodic styles.</p>



<p>He wrote L&#8217;Orfeo, one of the earliest operas in the history of music, an innovative work that remains a part of today&#8217;s orchestra&#8217;s repertoire. Additionally, he has written sacred music.</p>



<h3 id="orlando-di-lasso-1532-1594" class="wp-block-heading">Orlando di Lasso (1532 &#8211; 1594)</h3>



<p>Lasso was a Franco-Flemish composer. With more than two thousand compositions to his credit, he was a prolific and versatile author. This collection includes all genres of his day, secular and sacred, including the mass, secular chanson in several languages, Latin motets, hymns, and madrigals. When he held the position of Kapellmeister at the Munich court, at the end of his life, he cultivated sacred music with a special dedication.</p>



<p>He is considered the chief representative of the mature polyphonic style of the Netherlands school, along with Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. At the end of the 16th century, he was one of the most famous and influential musicians in Europe.</p>



<p>Regarding his madrigals, which he penned while living in Rome, his style was clear and concise, and his tunes were memorable.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The main reason I chose to compare these two madrigals is their contrasting themes. Lasso&#8217;s one is a jovial, lighthearted, and almost mocking monologue between a German soldier and a supposedly Italian woman. Contrary to Monteverdi, his lament is a sombre recognition of death in late life.</p>



<p>From the very beginning, these contrasting themes are evident.&nbsp;Matona, mia cara begins with all four voices in an F Major chord and in a fast tempo. The song develops with a mostly homophonic texture and a very marked rhythm, especially in the &#8220;Don, don, don&#8221; section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ah, Dolente partita opens with only two voices in unison, singing a long, high E. The two voices stay in unison until bar 4 when they drift apart. As a result, it sounds very sorrowful and enigmatic. As the other voices enter, they do so timidly and not simultaneously. Only in bar 15 do all five voices sing together. However, just after that, in bar 16, the top two voices become silent. This creates a variety of aural experiences that convey the theme of lamentation.</p>



<p>Monteverdi&#8217;s madrigal has a more polyphonic texture than Lasso&#8217;s. Consequently, Ah, Dolente partita has a richer sound ambience, but Matona, mia cara has a stronger rhythmic mark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a final contrast, I would like to mention the melodic shape. In Lasso&#8217;s madrigal, there are some upward and downward lines, with a lot of repetition of the melody, so it could be sung in a group with a dance-like feeling.&nbsp;Monteverdi&#8217;s melody, however, tends to move downward or remain flat, which is most evident towards the end, as if the music is taking small steps toward death.</p>

<p>I came across Oscar Peterson through a Mic.com article called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mic.com/culture/oscar-peterson-black-white" target="_blank">&#8220;Did Jazz Forget About Oscar Petterson?&#8221;</a>. The author points out that when you think about jazz names, Petterson&#8217;s is not the first that comes to your mind (Johnson, 2022).</p>



<p>Until today, I was unaware of Oscar Peterson&#8217;s name or work. Therefore, I decided to listen to &#8220;Hymn To Freedom&#8221;, a song featured in the article.</p>

<p>Oscar Peterson was born in Montreal, Canada on August 15, 1925 and grew up in a family where music was required of all five children. At the age of seven, he was able to play trumpet and piano. In his teens, he was already a prodigy when he became the star attraction of Canada&#8217;s renowned big band, the Johnny Holmes Orchestra (Peterson, 2003), and he was just 20 years old when he made his first trio recordings for RCA.</p>



<p>As a result of his musical genius, he was able to play with and alongside many jazz legends of the era, including Ella Fitzgerald, Roy Eldridge, Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and Billie Holiday (Johnson, 2022).</p>



<p>From 1959-1965, he formed and played with the Oscar Peterson trio with Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums, becoming one of jazz history&#8217;s most celebrated groups. Jazz historian Alyn Shipton explains one of their strengths as &#8220;Peterson&#8217;s skill at promoting group interaction marked the beginning of a seismic shift in piano trios.&#8221; (Hansen, 2014).</p>



<p>During the 1960s, there was racial segregation throughout the United States and Canada, and Peterson suffered a lot of racism when he toured with the Oscar Peterson trio. However, the experience of touring all over the world and especially his experiences in the south of the United States and observing the approach Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. took to peaceful protest, led him to write his most influential work, the “Hymn to Freedom” (Small, 2021).</p>



<p>People all over the world quickly embraced &#8220;Hymn To Freedom&#8221; as the anthem of the Civil Rights Movement when it was written in 1962. A timeless and relevant piece, this song has been played at many major events around the globe.</p>



<p>This song&#8217;s main melody captured my attention from the first listen. The song reminded me of a gospel song infused with blues and jazz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of structure, Peterson plays the melody four times before going into his solo, then returning to the original melody one last time. I believe this is an effective way of structuring a hymn, since the first four times he repeats the melody with almost no variation. As a result, the listener is able to engage with the melodic intention of the song.&nbsp;The piano solo builds upon the previous chord progression, but it is melodically much more unique than those first four repetitions, creating some interest. He concludes the solo with an apotheosis, but then the original melody is played softer, calmer, bringing peace to the listener&#8217;s heart.</p>



<p>My favorite part of this melody is the contrary motion technique, in which both voices go in opposite directions. While I&#8217;m still trying to figure out why I find it so pleasing to hear, I think it&#8217;s because it constantly creates a broader range of sounds. This makes it bigger and more interesting as a way of moving to the next part.</p>

<p>The chords are G minor, E major, D major, G major, D major, and F# Major.</p>



<h5 id="does-this-chord-progression-call-to-mind-any-music-you-know-from-later-eras" class="wp-block-heading">Does this chord progression call to mind any music you know from later eras?<br></h5>



<p>Although it didn&#8217;t sound like anything I&#8217;d heard before, I researched why this progression sounded so good together. One of the hints I found was that Gesualdo used mediant chords and doubly chromatic mediant chords, which indeed is true in this chord progression. E major is a doubly chromatic mediant from G minor. </p>

<p>In bars 9-20, I would describe it as a chromatic imitative counterpoint.</p>



<p>The texture at bb. 40-42 is homophonic.</p>



<h5 id="what-does-the-word-dolore-mean-at-b-55" class="wp-block-heading">What does the word ‘dolore’ mean at b. 55?</h5>



<p>It means pain, sorrow, and grief.</p>

<p>By itself, the word &#8220;dolore&#8221; implies sorrow, but in the context of the text, it can also mean relief.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>&#8220;but a soul without a heart can feel no sorrow.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>If the character dies or at least has his heart figuratively taken away, he becomes numb and cannot feel pain. A relief from the grief associated with the lover&#8217;s departure.</p>



<p>This is why the texture starts out polyphonic and with dissonances and then turns homophonic and consonant. Additionally, the melody creates a U shape. Starting moving downwards, taking the meaning of the word &#8220;dolore&#8221; to inconsolable grief, shifting to a rising melody towards the final G major chord. I interpret this last rising as Gesualdo&#8217;s acceptance of pain as an immutable truth or perhaps a morbid pleasure from the composer suffering from insanity at the end of his life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I must admit that I didn&#8217;t know who Gesualdo was until today, so I had to make some research about the composer.</p>



<p>A Prince who composed secular madrigals, sacred vocal music, and instrumental music, Carlo Gesualdo da Venosa (c 1566 &#8211; 1613) published six books of madrigals and three books of sacred pieces during his lifetime. He was also notorious for brutally murdering his wife and lover in bed. In addition to this cold-hearted murder, many depraved tales have been told about Gesualdo&#8217;s mental health. Through these stories (whether true or not, it&#8217;s up for debate), we can trace a psychological portrait behind the composer whose work represents the culmination of Renaissance music at the end of the 16th century.</p>



<p>His harmonic language is still considered daring and extravagant today because it incorporates elements of the late Italian madrigals, characterized by sound experimentalism. He used complex chromaticism in a way that was extraordinary for his time. This would not be heard again, or even hinted at until Wagner, Schoenberg and Stravinsky took it to new heights.</p>



<p>This idiosyncratic use of chromaticism was not only an attempt to break the rules, representing his era in which Mannerism was emerging as deliberately disruptive but also had a rather specific objective: word painting.</p>



<p>As an example, when the subject of Amor, pace non chero of his 1st Book of Madrigals calls for his lover, he uses consonance and long notes (Garbuio &amp; Fiorini, 2015).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="676" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-1024x676.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-825" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-1024x676.jpeg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-300x198.jpeg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-768x507.jpeg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-1536x1014.jpeg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-2048x1352.jpeg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-640x423.jpeg 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-960x634.jpeg 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-scaled.jpeg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>But in Mille volte il moro of his 6th Book of Madrigals, the Morte (death) is described with uncontrolled polyphony and highly dissonant intervals (Garbuio &amp; Fiorini, 2015).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="674" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-1024x674.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-827" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-1024x674.jpeg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-300x198.jpeg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-768x506.jpeg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-1536x1011.jpeg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-2048x1349.jpeg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-640x421.jpeg 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-960x632.jpeg 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-scaled.jpeg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how the technical complexity and themes changed from one book to another during his short life. The polyphonic tradition of the Renaissance dominates the first two books, while harmonic experimentalism dominates the third and fourth books. The last two, however, are characterized by more chromatic and dissonant writing, typically associated with mature composers. Considering the themes, his first two books are more simplistic, whereas his last two books are more dramatic in depicting themes of torture, pain, sadness, and death.</p>



<p>It surprised me to find that although we see Gesualdo as an avant-garde musical genius of his time, some people consider him conservative. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;As conservative as it was possible to be in this time. Monteverdi was the radical, the new. There is a very curious letter from the poet Guarini, in which he says he prefers Gesualdo to the modern style because he is ‘so far from the hardness of Monteverdi.’ For Guarini, Gesualdo is so nice, so easy! Exactly the opposite of what we now think.”</p><cite>(Ross, 2011)</cite></blockquote>



<p>Even though other contemporary composers experimented with new sonorities and pushed further the boundaries of what music could be, I believe Gesualdo was one of the leading composers of the late Renaissance. While developing polyphony, a better sense of structure and rhythmic order, he explored contrasting emotions (like in Dolcissima mia vita) and influenced composers hundreds of years after his death.</p>
