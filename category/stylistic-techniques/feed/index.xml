										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On the Academic Music Discord server, someone posted a video about Omar Thomas, a composer I had never heard of before.</p>



<p>A composer, arranger and educator, Omar Thomas was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1984. His parents are Guyanese, and he moved to Boston in 2006 to pursue a Master of Music degree at New England Conservatory.</p>



<p>A piece written for a wind ensemble, Piano and Drum Set, Come Sunday celebrates the Hammond organ&#8217;s central role in black worship. The second movement, Shout!, is an energetic celebration of gospel, jazz and blues, which shows influences from Duke Wellington and Charles Mingus as well as traditional church singing.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In listening to Shout!, I was surprised at how energetic it was after the slow and melodic first movement. There was an instant connection for me to the rhythm of this piece, marked by brass, bass, and drums, with the repetitive woodwinds in a high register adding the necessary tension.</p>



<p>As I listened to this piece, I was reminded of 70s funk horns and woodwinds. That&#8217;s what makes this piece so beautiful. Mixing genres and decades, creating a fresh and joyful time for the listener and for the players.</p>



<p>Since I am unfamiliar with much of the new classical music, I am enjoying this opportunity to listen to contemporary composers. At the same time that I study traditional techniques, I believe this will facilitate me in understanding the paths new composers are taking.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="first-species">First Species</h4>



<p>Using the tips from the First Species, I created a melodic line that was always consonant and moved mostly in contrary motion.</p>

<h4 id="second-species">Second Species</h4>



<p>My greatest struggle came in bars 3 and 4, where I was trying to connect the melody with the given D in bar 4. Keeping with the instructions to make leaps inside the bar, I decided to leap from B to E in bar 3.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="347" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-1024x347.png" alt="" class="wp-image-899" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-1024x347.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-300x102.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-768x260.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-1536x520.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-2048x694.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-640x217.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-960x325.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 id="third-species">Third Species</h4>



<p>Due to the pre-given patterns in bar 4  (nota cambiata pattern) and bar 6 (double neighbour pattern) in the third species, I started this species backwards in bar 6. Even with the given patterns, I tried to maintain a fluid melodic line with no big leaps, and always respected the previous species&#8217; guidelines.</p>

<h4 id="fourth-species">Fourth Species</h4>



<p>Since the suspension must be resolved downwards and in consonance with the upbeat, I found this one to be the easiest species. </p>

<h4 id="fifth-species">Fifth Species</h4>

</div></figure>



<p>As compared to the previous species, the fifth one took me a lot lI wasn&#8217;t sure how the bass and alto should harmonize with the tenor while imitating each other. Jacob Gran&#8217;s video helped me realize we should make the three-voice counterpoint as harmonically complete as possible. Thus, for example, in bar 3, the bass is supposed to imitate the tenor by going from D to F, but that would be dissonant. The right choice is E since it makes a C major triad.</p>

<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Violin Concerto &quot;Rhapsody &amp; Fantasia&quot;: Ia. Rock the Violin in Rhapsody.

</div></figure>



<p>In another Spotify discovery, I listened to a piece that I had never heard before. My attention was immediately captured when a traditional drum kit entered playing a classic hip-hop pattern in the first 16 seconds.</p>



<p>Rock the Violin in Rhapsody. Hip-Hop is the first movement of the Violin Concerto &#8220;Rhapsody &amp; Fantasy&#8221; by Eldbjørg Hemsing and Tan Dun. Hemsing is one of the best violinists in Norway, while Tan Dun is one of the most renowned conductors and composers that lives in New York but was born in China.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-issuu wp-block-embed-issuu"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div data-url="https://issuu.com/scoresondemand/docs/violin_concerto_rhapsody_fantasia_5/4" style="width: 640px; height: 453px;" class="issuuembed"></div><script type="text/javascript" src="//e.issuu.com/embed.js" async="true"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Having found a score for this concerto, I discovered that it includes a strong percussion section with five players, in addition to woodwinds, brass, and strings. It&#8217;s easy to hear the rhythm throughout this piece since it&#8217;s very heavy on it.</p>



<p>My favourite aspect of the piece was the constant play between rhythmic, hip-hop ambient and the almost wild solo violin. The play kept the piece alive and prevented it from becoming monotonous, which could happen with a simple hip-hop beat.</p>



<p>As described by Xenia Hanusiak <a href="https://classicalvoiceamerica.org/2018/09/26/dun-links-ancient-modern-worlds-in-new-violin-work/" target="_blank">in her article</a>, the composer calls this Rhapsody and Fantasia &#8220;the perfect result&#8221; of his thirty-five years of living in New York. It is one of the most interesting pieces I have heard in a while due to its combination of street sound rhythm, classical Chinese instruments, and a harsh nordic violin.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Exercise 1.2: First species In this exercise I followed the tip given by the briefing and worked backwards,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4 id="exercise-1-2-first-species">Exercise 1.2: First species</h4>



<p>In this exercise I followed the tip given by the briefing and worked backwards, starting from the last bar. I followed the tip of if the cantus rises from the leading note to the tonic, then the free part falls from the second degree to the octave. From there, I went to the first bar and add an octave. Between bars 2 and 6 I mostly worked stepwise, with a 6th, 3rd, 3rd, 6th, and 6th. I then noticed a leap to get from bar 6 to 7, which didn&#8217;t sound perfect but it didn&#8217;t sound bad either.</p>



<p>In the end, when I listened to it, I found it very dull. Probably because of the mostly stepwise motion and some parallel motion, it sounded predictable. So, I decided to give it another try and start with a 5th.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="201" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-1024x201.png" alt="" class="wp-image-873" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-1024x201.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-300x59.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-768x151.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-1536x302.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-640x126.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-960x189.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1.png 2047w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Exercise 1.2 first try</figcaption></figure>



<p>I left the last two bars, erased all the rest and started with a C. From there I tried to add some contrary motion with a 3rd, 6th, 6th, 3rd and 6th. From bar 6 to 7 there&#8217;s the same leap as the previous try, but this time it sounded better. Probably because from bar 5 to 6 there is a contrary motion, or because it comes from a 3rd to 6th instead of a 6th to 6th. I&#8217;m not really sure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="201" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-1024x201.png" alt="" class="wp-image-874" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-1024x201.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-300x59.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-768x151.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-1536x302.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-640x126.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-960x189.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1.png 2047w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Exercise 1.2 second try</figcaption></figure>



<p>When I checked the sample solution I was surprised to see that my second try is exactly the same as the solution. I believe this must be because there&#8217;s a much more finite option with just 3rds and 6ths, but I was pleased to know that my effort to make a second try got me closer to what is expected from this exercise.</p>



<h4 id="exercise-1-3-second-species">Exercise 1.3: Second species</h4>



<p>I started this exercise as the previous one, writing the last two bars first and then moving from the first bar until the cadence.</p>



<p>In this case, I followed the tip of leaving the first downbeat with a rest to establish a pulse and started the counterpoint with an octave. From there I wrote all downbeats with consonants and the upbeats I used as passing notes, except in bar 5 because I felt that the top melody needed a higher note to get to the climax.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="187" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-1024x187.png" alt="" class="wp-image-876" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-1024x187.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-768x140.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-1536x280.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-2048x374.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-640x117.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-960x175.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3.png 2202w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Exercise 1.3</figcaption></figure>



<h4 id="exercise-1-4-fourth-species">Exercise 1.4: Fourth species</h4>



<p>This exercise was different because some of the notes of the species melody were given. In this case it starts with a 5th that turns into a dissonance with a 4th wich I resolved down one step into a consonant 3rd. The next note was also given and I raised the melody to a 6th that suspends into a dissonant 7th and is resolved to a 6th that leads to raise one step to the final octave.</p>

<p>This exercise was similar to the previous one, but this time with several consecutive suspensions. With the notes given, I developed the species melody following the tips of the Fourth Species and previous ones. For example, started in an octave, kept the range within the octave above, one climax only, the dissonance is resolved on step down on the weak beat and the cadence with contrary motion by step. In the end, one thing I noticed is that the species melody is very predictable between bars 5 and 8, because the P-D-R is always 4th to 3rd. I tried to change this but, with the given notes, it was impossible. I later checked the sample solution and it was the same, so I suppose it&#8217;s the only way to complete this exercise.</p>

<h4 id="exercise-1-5-imitative-counterpoint">Exercise 1.5: Imitative counterpoint</h4>



<p>Initially, I had difficulty understanding the exercise. It didn&#8217;t make sense to me how the motive could fit in the blank spaces. Once you understood how it worked, it became an intuitive exercise. The only thing I couldn&#8217;t figure out was how to add the dash in the lyrics in Sibelius so it appears only in the beat, rather than randomly in the bar, as it appears below. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="565" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-1024x565.png" alt="" class="wp-image-883" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-1024x565.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-300x166.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-768x424.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-1536x848.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-2048x1130.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-640x353.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-960x530.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Exercise 1.5 first exercise</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was the first time a third voice was added to the exercises. There was no change in the challenge: imitative counterpoint. I found this one easier than the previous one, despite the new voice&#8217;s increased challenge. The gaps only allowed space for imitation of the motive, so I was able to write the motive easily and then check for any counterpoint errors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As important as the madrigal and chanson, the polyphonic setting of the Catholic Mass was the most significant&nbsp;genre during the Renaissance. Many of the greatest compositions of music have been influenced by musical settings of the Mass.</p>



<h2 id="what-makes-a-mass" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1664189473548 is-style-cnvs-block-section-heading-4 halignleft" >

		<span>What makes a Mass?</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Besides being a religious ceremony, a mass is also a genre of music. The mass, as a ceremony, is a rite of the Roman Catholic church. It is divided into three parts: introductory rites, the liturgy of the word, and the eucharistic liturgy. During this ceremony, the congregation receives bread and wine reenacting the last supper (Keep It Classical, 2021).</p>



<p>Several parts of the liturgy are either spoken, intoned or sung. Some of them, called Proper, vary according to where we are in the liturgical calendar, while others, called Ordinary, remain the same.</p>



<p>Mass as a musical genre is made up of five movements: Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, and Anus Dei sung by the choir during the Ordinary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creating musical continuity among all these different sections was the greatest formal challenge. Several solutions were developed, including repeating the same plainchant (cantus firmus) throughout. This was done well by talented Mass composers. Throughout every section, the cantus firmus is not repeated note-for-note but rather fragmented into long, sustained notes sung by the tenor.</p>



<p>Masses in the Renaissance were generally divided into two categories: those composed based on previously composed materials and those without.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"><table><thead><tr><th>Previously composed materials</th><th>Without previously composed materials</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cantus Firmus</td><td>Cyclic</td></tr><tr><td>Paraphrase</td><td>Soggetto Cavato</td></tr><tr><td>Parody</td><td>Freely Composed</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

		<span>The evolution of the Masses</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>In my research, I have found that most literature focuses on the Mass during the Renaissance period, leaving only minimal attention to the Middle Ages and even less for the following centuries. It may be due to a more uniform unity in style during the Renaissance, pushed by the church. A prominent example is Pope Gregorious&#8217; role in bringing together diverse chants into an orderly and uniform whole for the western region of the Church to use.&nbsp;Similarly, the Council of Trent called for clearer texts, simpler polyphony, and fewer melismas later on (Monson, 2002).</p>



<h5 id="before-1400">Before 1400</h5>



<p>The Roman Catholic Church was the only institution that could educate the populace to become literate and enforce standards of faith and morality. This was due to the barbaric invasion and collapse of the Roman Empire. This institution stood against the grit and dereliction of the Dark Ages. Throughout Western Europe, the Church played a critical role in preserving and transmitting Christian culture, which led to music composition and performance practices. Medieval music had the function of enhancing the liturgy and creating a mood of peace, which could be achieved by singing monophonic plainchant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Middle Ages Gregorian masses were sung monophonically in unison, with a focus on the Proper. A famous example of the first complete setting of the Ordinary of the Mass dates from the 14th century, Guillaume de Machaut&#8217;s La Messe de Nostre Dame.</p>



<h5 id="renaissance">Renaissance </h5>



<p>Between 1400 and 1600 was the main period of Mass composition, when the Mass took on its present meaning of a polyphonic setting of the entire Mass Ordinary.&nbsp; Renaissance composers regarded the Ordinary Mass as the equivalent of 18th-century composers&#8217; symphonies, or 19th-century composers&#8217; operas: the ultimate test of their talents and creativity. In this period, composers within the area of sacred music focused primarily on the forms of mass, with their multiple-movement format offering large-scale structure opportunities (Apel, 2000).</p>



<h5 id="after-1600">After 1600</h5>



<p>The importance of Mass composition declined after 1600. In spite of this, there were developments such as huge choirs of 32 and 48 parts (Orazio Benevoli, 1605-72) and the use of orchestras, leading to Bach&#8217;s B-minor Mass (1733-38) (Apel, 2000).</p>



<p>The mass evolved towards secularization in the 18th and 19th centuries with works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Liszt and Bruckner.</p>



<p>The 20th and 21st centuries saw composers write masses in a variety of styles, forms, and functions that were even more diverse than before (e.g. Vaughan Williams, Stravinsky, Duruflé, Britten, Rutter, Sato).</p>

Mix in your personal views with what you have discovered through research.</em></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-default"><blockquote><p>At the end of the road, music is a religion.</p><cite>(Spitzer, 2021)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>As a result of my research, it&#8217;s quite clear that music and religion have always been closely intertwined, and their impact on who we are today is massive. As a matter of fact, some advocates argue that in place of agriculture and farming, music and religion would be the main drivers of sedentary behavior for humans (Spitzer, 2021).</p>



<p>But which came first? Music or religion? I could not find anyone who could answer this question. This leaves me believing that since humans first beat sticks repeatedly against rocks, there has been a sense of spirituality as well as divinity. This, along with the quote I used to begin this text, sum up what I believe and is supported by my research: religion and music are so closely related that it&#8217;s difficult not to believe they are one and the same. 500 words are too few for me to express my view, but I&#8217;ll try to summarize it into three points.</p>



<h5 id="both-religion-and-music-alter-the-state-of-mind">Both religion and music alter the state of mind</h5>



<p>According to Gilbert Rouget, music can induce two types of altered state of consciousness (ASC) across all cultures, &#8216;trance&#8217; (solitude, silence, immobility, sensory) and &#8216;ecstasy&#8217; (movement, noise, sociable) (Rouget, 1985). The same applies to religion. When dancing for a long period of time, the body suffers from fatigue, hyperventilation, hypoglycaemia, and hypoglycaemia, leading to hallucinations. Overheating at raves releases endogenous opiates. When you fast and sleep less before a rave, the driving rhythms are amplified. There has been evidence of all these effects in religious traditions, from Pentecostal churches in the American Deep South to Sufi dervishes (Spitzer, 2021).</p>



<h5 id="both-religion-and-music-are-based-on-routines">Both religion and music are based on routines</h5>



<p>Religion is embedded in everyday life, and it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise. One of the best examples is when John Cage asked someone about their religion while in Japan.&nbsp;The answer was dance. Japanese practice Buddhist and Shinto rituals, but they don&#8217;t go to church or temple on a regular basis. It is so integrated into the culture that it appears in daily gestures and routines, undisturbed by ordinary life (Byrne, 2017). The same with music. A social organization is marked by song at nearly every point in the lives of communities, according to ethnomusicologist Alan P. Merriam—birth songs, lullabies, naming songs, toilet-training songs, puberty songs, greetings, love songs, marriage songs, clan songs, and funeral songs.</p>



<h5 id="both-religion-and-music-connect-people">Both religion and music connect people</h5>



<p>People turn to religion and music during hard times. There is a search for hope, connection, and optimism among people. Because of its certainty, religious thought is particularly conducive to optimism. In addition, Michael Hogg  asserts that feeling closely connected with others leads to feelings of more security, confidence, and certainty about what to expect in the social world as a result (Hogg, 2003). The same happens with music. There is no doubt that music helps us feel hopeful and secure in times of&nbsp;uncertainty, such as&nbsp;with shows like Live Aid, The Concert For New York City or Concert For Bangladesh.</p>



<p>When I attended Kendirck Lamar&#8217;s concert last time, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was watching a music concert or a worship service. As I looked at other people at the concert, they all seemed mentally altered, either in a trance or ecstatic state. They were making the same moves and singing the same lyrics. Most importantly, they all seemed connected and hopeful.</p>



<p>Was this music or religion?</p>

<p>As usual, my Spotify is on shuffle and today I heard some flamenco, which I am not particularly familiar with, but enjoy listening to occasionally. This song caught my attention, so I listened carefully.</p>



<p>Originally from Ciudad Real, José Almarcha is an outstanding guitarist and composer. As a student of flamenco at the Córdoba Conservatory of Music, José studied with flamenco masters including Paco Serrano and Niño de Pura. A number of dancers have been accompanied by him, including Olga Pericet, Marco Flores, and Antonio Canales. His albums have received excellent reviews and he has been hailed as one of Spain&#8217;s most promising flamenco guitarists.</p>



<p>The singer recently released Casa del Gallego, which is a farruca, a dance-centric style of flamenco characterized by sombre virtuosity, aggressive footwork, and dramatic tempo changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this song, the melody is introduced by a flamenco guitar riff, but a few seconds into the song, there&#8217;s a surprise: a trombone with a delay effect. Not a typical flamenco sound and a hint to the listener that this probably isn&#8217;t a traditional flamenco but yes, a modern view of the style.</p>



<p>Enters the piano a few seconds later. With the trombone on the bottom, the piano on top with high notes, and the flamenco guitar in the middle, the three instruments make a beautiful sonic sandwich.</p>



<p>A mellow melody is gradually introduced by the trio, along with occasional cymbal sounds.&nbsp;Still, the strumming and tapping of guitars always have a slight tension to them. Suddenly, the tension is released as the full band enters, with a Latin rhythm recognizable as flamenco, accompanied by a shoe-tapping sound, along with another surprise: an electric guitar. There is a clash between traditional and modern sounds in the music now, and I find it very appealing.</p>



<p>As the song continues, tension is built and released with more and more shoe tapping and stomping until the apotheosis.</p>



<p>It was very interesting to see how flamenco is approached in a new way. It was entertaining to watch the piece&#8217;s sudden changes in sound dynamics that are intended to be interpreted by a dancer and add drama to the performance.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A master of contrapuntal composition, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina composed 105 masses and 250 motets in the Italian Renaissance. A significant figure in the development of polyphony, he represented the conservatism of the 16th century on the subject of church music.</p>



<p>Though it is widely believed that Palestrina saved polyphony by himself, it is a myth that is widely accepted, although it is also true that the Council of Trent (1545-1563) stressed the importance of musical clarity and Palestrina himself advocated it (Monson, 2002).</p>



<p>Palestrina&#8217;s Missa Brevis (Short Mass) was first published in 1570 and is considered one of his most famous works. There are four voices in the Kyrie (Cantus, Altus, Tenor, and Bassus). With the exception of a brief homophonic section at the end of the second Kyrie, the texture is almost exclusively polyphonic. With a gentle melodic line and simple harmony, this piece stays in F major with only occasional chromatic changes, creating a restful, calm atmosphere.</p>

	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Exercise 1.1</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Listen to a recording of the <em>Kyrie </em>from Palestrina’s <em>Missa Brevis </em>and follow with a score.<br>Read the following comments about features of the music, and note an instance where each occurs in the score. You may find it to be most effective if you mark each occurrence onto a printout of the score or annotate a pdf of it electronically. Keep your annotations for reference later.</p>



<ul><li>The entry of each vocal part is in imitation.</li><li>The texture is polyphonic &#8211; consisting of several independently moving, though coordinated, vocal parts.</li><li>The melody lines themselves move smoothly &#8211; mainly flowing by step with occasional leaps but then often turning back and returning to where they came from, or nearby.</li><li>Each part rises and falls, helping to create a sense of direction but with no single part assuming dominance over the others.</li><li>The ranges of the individual voice parts lie mainly within an octave and there is a general sense of balance to the individual melodic lines.

<p></p>



<h3 id="claudio-monteverdi-1567-1643">Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643)</h3>



<p>Monteverdi was an Italian composer, violinist, singer, and priest. He is often considered a revolutionary who marked the transition from Renaissance to Baroque music.</p>



<p>Until the age of forty, Monteverdi worked primarily on madrigals, composing a total of nine books. In about four years, Monteverdi completed his first book of twenty-one madrigals for five voices. Overall, the first eight madrigals show the massive development from Renaissance polyphonic to baroque monodic styles.</p>



<p>He wrote L&#8217;Orfeo, one of the earliest operas in the history of music, an innovative work that remains a part of today&#8217;s orchestra&#8217;s repertoire. Additionally, he has written sacred music.</p>



<h3 id="orlando-di-lasso-1532-1594">Orlando di Lasso (1532 &#8211; 1594)</h3>



<p>Lasso was a Franco-Flemish composer. With more than two thousand compositions to his credit, he was a prolific and versatile author. This collection includes all genres of his day, secular and sacred, including the mass, secular chanson in several languages, Latin motets, hymns, and madrigals. When he held the position of Kapellmeister at the Munich court, at the end of his life, he cultivated sacred music with a special dedication.</p>



<p>He is considered the chief representative of the mature polyphonic style of the Netherlands school, along with Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. At the end of the 16th century, he was one of the most famous and influential musicians in Europe.</p>



<p>Regarding his madrigals, which he penned while living in Rome, his style was clear and concise, and his tunes were memorable.</p>



<h3 id="comparison-between-orlando-di-lassos-matona-mia-cara-and-claudio-monteverdis-ah-dolente-partita">Comparison between Orlando di Lasso&#8217;s Matona, mia cara and Claudio Monteverdi&#8217;s Ah, Dolente Partita</h3>

</div></figure>



<p>The main reason I chose to compare these two madrigals is their contrasting themes. Lasso&#8217;s one is a jovial, lighthearted, and almost mocking monologue between a German soldier and a supposedly Italian woman. Contrary to Monteverdi, his lament is a sombre recognition of death in late life.</p>



<p>From the very beginning, these contrasting themes are evident.&nbsp;Matona, mia cara begins with all four voices in an F Major chord and in a fast tempo. The song develops with a mostly homophonic texture and a very marked rhythm, especially in the &#8220;Don, don, don&#8221; section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ah, Dolente partita opens with only two voices in unison, singing a long, high E. The two voices stay in unison until bar 4 when they drift apart. As a result, it sounds very sorrowful and enigmatic. As the other voices enter, they do so timidly and not simultaneously. Only in bar 15 do all five voices sing together. However, just after that, in bar 16, the top two voices become silent. This creates a variety of aural experiences that convey the theme of lamentation.</p>



<p>Monteverdi&#8217;s madrigal has a more polyphonic texture than Lasso&#8217;s. Consequently, Ah, Dolente partita has a richer sound ambience, but Matona, mia cara has a stronger rhythmic mark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a final contrast, I would like to mention the melodic shape. In Lasso&#8217;s madrigal, there are some upward and downward lines, with a lot of repetition of the melody, so it could be sung in a group with a dance-like feeling.&nbsp;Monteverdi&#8217;s melody, however, tends to move downward or remain flat, which is most evident towards the end, as if the music is taking small steps toward death.</p>

<p>I came across Oscar Peterson through a Mic.com article called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mic.com/culture/oscar-peterson-black-white" target="_blank">&#8220;Did Jazz Forget About Oscar Petterson?&#8221;</a>. The author points out that when you think about jazz names, Petterson&#8217;s is not the first that comes to your mind (Johnson, 2022).</p>



<p>Until today, I was unaware of Oscar Peterson&#8217;s name or work. Therefore, I decided to listen to &#8220;Hymn To Freedom&#8221;, a song featured in the article.</p>

<p>Oscar Peterson was born in Montreal, Canada on August 15, 1925 and grew up in a family where music was required of all five children. At the age of seven, he was able to play trumpet and piano. In his teens, he was already a prodigy when he became the star attraction of Canada&#8217;s renowned big band, the Johnny Holmes Orchestra (Peterson, 2003), and he was just 20 years old when he made his first trio recordings for RCA.</p>



<p>As a result of his musical genius, he was able to play with and alongside many jazz legends of the era, including Ella Fitzgerald, Roy Eldridge, Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and Billie Holiday (Johnson, 2022).</p>



<p>From 1959-1965, he formed and played with the Oscar Peterson trio with Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums, becoming one of jazz history&#8217;s most celebrated groups. Jazz historian Alyn Shipton explains one of their strengths as &#8220;Peterson&#8217;s skill at promoting group interaction marked the beginning of a seismic shift in piano trios.&#8221; (Hansen, 2014).</p>



<p>During the 1960s, there was racial segregation throughout the United States and Canada, and Peterson suffered a lot of racism when he toured with the Oscar Peterson trio. However, the experience of touring all over the world and especially his experiences in the south of the United States and observing the approach Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. took to peaceful protest, led him to write his most influential work, the “Hymn to Freedom” (Small, 2021).</p>



<p>People all over the world quickly embraced &#8220;Hymn To Freedom&#8221; as the anthem of the Civil Rights Movement when it was written in 1962. A timeless and relevant piece, this song has been played at many major events around the globe.</p>



<p>This song&#8217;s main melody captured my attention from the first listen. The song reminded me of a gospel song infused with blues and jazz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of structure, Peterson plays the melody four times before going into his solo, then returning to the original melody one last time. I believe this is an effective way of structuring a hymn, since the first four times he repeats the melody with almost no variation. As a result, the listener is able to engage with the melodic intention of the song.&nbsp;The piano solo builds upon the previous chord progression, but it is melodically much more unique than those first four repetitions, creating some interest. He concludes the solo with an apotheosis, but then the original melody is played softer, calmer, bringing peace to the listener&#8217;s heart.</p>



<p>My favorite part of this melody is the contrary motion technique, in which both voices go in opposite directions. While I&#8217;m still trying to figure out why I find it so pleasing to hear, I think it&#8217;s because it constantly creates a broader range of sounds. This makes it bigger and more interesting as a way of moving to the next part.</p>

<p>The chords are G minor, E major, D major, G major, D major, and F# Major.</p>



<h5 id="does-this-chord-progression-call-to-mind-any-music-you-know-from-later-eras">Does this chord progression call to mind any music you know from later eras?<br></h5>



<p>Although it didn&#8217;t sound like anything I&#8217;d heard before, I researched why this progression sounded so good together. One of the hints I found was that Gesualdo used mediant chords and doubly chromatic mediant chords, which indeed is true in this chord progression. E major is a doubly chromatic mediant from G minor. </p>

<h5 id="how-would-you-describe-the-music-in-bb-9-20-and-the-texture-at-bb-40-42">How would you describe the music in bb. 9-20 and the texture at bb. 40-42?</h5>



<p>In bars 9-20, I would describe it as a chromatic imitative counterpoint.</p>



<p>The texture at bb. 40-42 is homophonic.</p>



<h5 id="what-does-the-word-dolore-mean-at-b-55">What does the word ‘dolore’ mean at b. 55?</h5>



<p>It means pain, sorrow, and grief.</p>



<h5 id="in-your-own-words-describe-the-kind-of-harmony-melody-and-texture-that-gesualdo-has-employed-to-carry-its-meaning">In your own words, describe the kind of harmony, melody and texture that Gesualdo has employed to carry its meaning.</h5>



<p>By itself, the word &#8220;dolore&#8221; implies sorrow, but in the context of the text, it can also mean relief.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>&#8220;but a soul without a heart can feel no sorrow.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>If the character dies or at least has his heart figuratively taken away, he becomes numb and cannot feel pain. A relief from the grief associated with the lover&#8217;s departure.</p>



<p>This is why the texture starts out polyphonic and with dissonances and then turns homophonic and consonant. Additionally, the melody creates a U shape. Starting moving downwards, taking the meaning of the word &#8220;dolore&#8221; to inconsolable grief, shifting to a rising melody towards the final G major chord. I interpret this last rising as Gesualdo&#8217;s acceptance of pain as an immutable truth or perhaps a morbid pleasure from the composer suffering from insanity at the end of his life.</p>

<p>A Prince who composed secular madrigals, sacred vocal music, and instrumental music, Carlo Gesualdo da Venosa (c 1566 &#8211; 1613) published six books of madrigals and three books of sacred pieces during his lifetime. He was also notorious for brutally murdering his wife and lover in bed. In addition to this cold-hearted murder, many depraved tales have been told about Gesualdo&#8217;s mental health. Through these stories (whether true or not, it&#8217;s up for debate), we can trace a psychological portrait behind the composer whose work represents the culmination of Renaissance music at the end of the 16th century.</p>



<p>His harmonic language is still considered daring and extravagant today because it incorporates elements of the late Italian madrigals, characterized by sound experimentalism. He used complex chromaticism in a way that was extraordinary for his time. This would not be heard again, or even hinted at until Wagner, Schoenberg and Stravinsky took it to new heights.</p>



<p>This idiosyncratic use of chromaticism was not only an attempt to break the rules, representing his era in which Mannerism was emerging as deliberately disruptive but also had a rather specific objective: word painting.</p>



<p>As an example, when the subject of Amor, pace non chero of his 1st Book of Madrigals calls for his lover, he uses consonance and long notes (Garbuio &amp; Fiorini, 2015).</p>

<p>But in Mille volte il moro of his 6th Book of Madrigals, the Morte (death) is described with uncontrolled polyphony and highly dissonant intervals (Garbuio &amp; Fiorini, 2015).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how the technical complexity and themes changed from one book to another during his short life. The polyphonic tradition of the Renaissance dominates the first two books, while harmonic experimentalism dominates the third and fourth books. The last two, however, are characterized by more chromatic and dissonant writing, typically associated with mature composers. Considering the themes, his first two books are more simplistic, whereas his last two books are more dramatic in depicting themes of torture, pain, sadness, and death.</p>



<p>It surprised me to find that although we see Gesualdo as an avant-garde musical genius of his time, some people consider him conservative. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;As conservative as it was possible to be in this time. Monteverdi was the radical, the new. There is a very curious letter from the poet Guarini, in which he says he prefers Gesualdo to the modern style because he is ‘so far from the hardness of Monteverdi.’ For Guarini, Gesualdo is so nice, so easy! Exactly the opposite of what we now think.”</p><cite>(Ross, 2011)</cite></blockquote>



<p>Even though other contemporary composers experimented with new sonorities and pushed further the boundaries of what music could be, I believe Gesualdo was one of the leading composers of the late Renaissance. While developing polyphony, a better sense of structure and rhythmic order, he explored contrasting emotions (like in Dolcissima mia vita) and influenced composers hundreds of years after his death.</p>
