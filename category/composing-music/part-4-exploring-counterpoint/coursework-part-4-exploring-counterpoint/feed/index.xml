										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the first exercise for a two-part experience, I aimed to compose something similar to what I heard from Bach and a more &#8220;traditional&#8221; invention. After reading about invention, I gathered some process rules that allow writing an invention.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Write a motif in one voice</li><li>The second voice repeats the motif in another octave</li><li>The first voice imitates the motif on the dominant</li><li>The second voice imitates the motif it played before but this time on the dominant</li><li>Then use parts or the whole motif in augmented, diminuted or inversed version while the other voice plays counterpoint</li><li>End in the tonic</li></ul>



<p>Although I know these are not strict rules, I tried to apply the process here to help me compose faster and with fewer elements. I must say I liked this process. I started with a motif that is played in both voices on the tonic and on the dominant. I then passed to both voices playing a diminuted version of the motif and ending with the oboe playing an inversion while the bassoon plays an augmented motif. </p>

<p>In my second exercise, I tried to apply a more rhythmic invention while using the marimba. As in the first exercise, I created a motif that is repeated and imitated by both voices. I didn&#8217;t feel the need to augment the motif since I got the sense that I would lose the rhythm of it, so I used a diminuted version of the motif in the marimba while the flute plays an inversion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During this project, I had to practice composing counterpoints for two instruments. There were two parts to the brief. With exercises 1 and 2, one of the instruments is already provided in the briefing, and the challenge is to compose a counterpoint for it. The task in exercises 3 and 4 is to compose two tunes with contrasting characters.</p>



<p>The workbook states that any tuning percussion instrument and woodwind instrument may be used. In order to get more familiar with tuned percussion, I decided to use them in all exercises.</p>



<p>You can download all Sibelius files <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RwWNerEX1QPvJzQT24C15wWg5U_f1dK6?usp=sharing" data-type="URL" data-id="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RwWNerEX1QPvJzQT24C15wWg5U_f1dK6?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h4>



<p>With this exercise, the top melody was provided and I was asked to compose the bottom melody. As I looked at the written melody for the first time, I noticed that it had long notes, mirims, and crochets, so I decided to use mostly quavers and semiquavers to have a nice rhythmic contrast. I also took advantage of the opportunity to contrast the dynamics, sometimes having the vibraphone play higher than the flute.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h4>



<p>Here, the bottom part was given, and I composed the top melody. With the first three bars of my melody, I worked with the staccato from the flute by adding semiquavers, resulting in an interaction between the two instruments. In the next three bars, I made the marimba melody follow the descending flute melody, but with fast notes to emphasize the different melodies. The marimba contrasts with the flute in the last three bars by going up while the flute continues to go down.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h4>



<p>In the third exercise, I followed the workbook&#8217;s suggestion and started one melody later than the other, so the listener could more easily pick out the different voices. I developed a little theme that begins with the flute, then the tubular bells accompany it. Following this repetition, however, both melodies drift away. With a wave-shaped melody, the flute is more unstable, with a descending melody in bar 3 and an ascending melody until bar 5. In the meantime, the tubular bells are more stable, using almost always the same rhythm except for bar 7 when they take the opportunity of the calmer flute to express themselves.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="exercise-4">Exercise 4</h4>



<p>Similarly to the previous exercise, I tried to start one melody after another, while the instruments followed a similar theme. I could see how this theme could be used in different ways if it were a longer composition. Thus, for example, the xylophone plays two notes on the first part of the theme while the bassoon plays staccato over the same notes. However, after this repetition, the melodies go the opposite way. Generally, they move oppositely, except in the last bar when both move down and up to the final F.</p>
