<p>I felt this fugue was really lovely, especially because I enjoyed the theme and Bach used it frequently throughout this composition. In fact, I thought this fugue was quite theme-centric, with the theme inverted, augmented, and rhythmically varied. It&#8217;s also worth noting that this fugue goes from a straightforward exposition to a three-voiced narrative.</p>



<p>To be clear, some sources indicate that this fugue is in Eb minor; nevertheless, the prelude is in Eb minor, but the fugue is in D# minor in most scores I discovered. Although I don&#8217;t believe it matters, I&#8217;ll keep mentioning that this fugue is in D# minor.</p>



<p>This fugue begins with the first voice exposition of the theme, while the second voice (in red) imitate it. Right away, the lowest voice repeats it a second time. Bach repeats this three-bar theme four times in the first 14 bars, which shows how important this theme is to him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-1024x614.png" alt="" class="wp-image-544" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-1024x614.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-300x180.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-768x461.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-1536x921.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-640x384.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-960x576.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1.png 1884w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In order to emphasize the theme-centric nature of the fugue, the theme is repeated five times from bar 19 to bar 29, before there is an inversion (in blue). I was interested to see if the inversion is an exact mirror of the theme. I got my answer right away: no. The very first note, D#, goes to an A#, the perfect fifth. However, the inversion goes down a perfect fourth. Following these first notes, everything is mirrored.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="573" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-1024x573.png" alt="" class="wp-image-545" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-1024x573.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-300x168.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-768x430.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-1536x859.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-640x358.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-960x537.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32.png 1888w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Afterwards, the lower voice plays an augmentation of the theme (in green) at double speed. In my opinion, this is where the piece begins to climax and become more complex.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="396" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-1024x396.png" alt="" class="wp-image-546" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-1024x396.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-300x116.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-768x297.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-1536x593.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-640x247.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-960x371.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14.png 1934w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It is difficult for me to follow and analyze without assistance from here. I noticed that the theme is imitated and reversed as well as amplified and augmented throughout the entire piece, making it a complex and engaging ending.</p>

<p>I found this fugue to be slow, sorrowful, but at the same time, I found it to sometimes be beautifully harmonious. Contrary to other fugues I have heard, I believe this could be played in a church, with the long notes resonating in the long walls. Alternatively, a choral group could perform it.</p>



<p>The theme (in red) and countertheme (in brown) are presented in the first six bars of this fugue, which is interesting. The theme&#8217;s long notes are precisely counterbalanced by the countertheme&#8217;s quavers, allowing both to be heard clearly. When the third voice is added in the lower bass, it sounds really lovely to me. This produces a really fascinating and recognizable sound that binds all of the voices together.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1008" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-1024x1008.png" alt="" class="wp-image-548" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-1024x1008.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-300x295.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-768x756.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-80x80.png 80w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-640x630.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-960x945.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I was curious as to how Bach composed the theme and counter-theme to work together so beautifully, so I decided to investigate further. One thing I observed is that both melodies, especially the countertheme, move in a step-by-step manner, only leaping in the finish. This, I believe, allows the intervals to move from fifths to thirds, as seen at the start of bar 5. In addition, the opposing motion in the first two bars, when one of the melodies rises (in red) and the other falls (in blue), generates a lovely contrast and tension, which is released in the last two bars, when both move in the same direction.<gwmw style="display:none;"></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="678" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-1024x678.png" alt="" class="wp-image-549" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-1024x678.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-300x199.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-768x508.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-640x424.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-960x635.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43.png 1496w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When I previously stated that I considered this piece to be quite harmonic at moments, I was making reference to bars 13 and 14. All melodies, I suppose, have the same function here: to set the stage for the return of the theme and countertheme, but this time in a more powerful form. The theme is mostly played by the two upper voices with the thirds. This brings the piece to a close with a mini-climax.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1001" height="1024" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-1001x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-550" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-1001x1024.png 1001w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-293x300.png 293w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-768x786.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-1501x1536.png 1501w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-300x307.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-640x655.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-960x982.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10.png 1604w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" /></figure>



<p>Something new appears later, at the conclusion of bar 20. The motif has been inverted (in blue). This inversion is accompanied by lower voice quavers that sound like the countertheme. I believe this is employed to have a familiar sound with this new inversion theme.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="724" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-1024x724.png" alt="" class="wp-image-551" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-1024x724.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-300x212.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-768x543.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-1536x1087.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-640x453.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-960x679.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16.png 1668w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One last thing I&#8217;d like to mention is something I don&#8217;t recall hearing in previous fugues. When two voices play similar melodies while the other two wait their time to play identical tunes. As with prior examples, most of this is done using the third interval. All of this builds up to the final theme and countertheme section.<gwmw style="display:none;"></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="355" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-1024x355.png" alt="" class="wp-image-552" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-1024x355.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-300x104.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-768x267.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-1536x533.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-2048x711.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-640x222.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33-960x333.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.41.33.png 2328w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During this project, I had to practice composing counterpoints for two instruments. There were two parts to the brief. With exercises 1 and 2, one of the instruments is already provided in the briefing, and the challenge is to compose a counterpoint for it. The task in exercises 3 and 4 is to compose two tunes with contrasting characters.</p>



<p>The workbook states that any tuning percussion instrument and woodwind instrument may be used. In order to get more familiar with tuned percussion, I decided to use them in all exercises.</p>



<h4 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h4>



<p>With this exercise, the top melody was provided and I was asked to compose the bottom melody. As I looked at the written melody for the first time, I noticed that it had long notes, mirims, and crochets, so I decided to use mostly quavers and semiquavers to have a nice rhythmic contrast. I also took advantage of the opportunity to contrast the dynamics, sometimes having the vibraphone play higher than the flute.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="329" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-1024x329.png" alt="" class="wp-image-521" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-1024x329.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-300x96.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-768x246.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-1536x493.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-2048x657.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-640x205.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-960x308.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1.png 2163w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h4>



<p>Here, the bottom part was given, and I composed the top melody. With the first three bars of my melody, I worked with the staccato from the flute by adding semiquavers, resulting in an interaction between the two instruments. In the next three bars, I made the marimba melody follow the descending flute melody, but with fast notes to emphasize the different melodies. The marimba contrasts with the flute in the last three bars by going up while the flute continues to go down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="577" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-1024x577.png" alt="" class="wp-image-522" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-1024x577.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-768x433.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-1536x866.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-2048x1154.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-640x361.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-960x541.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2.png 2166w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h4>



<p>In the third exercise, I followed the workbook&#8217;s suggestion and started one melody later than the other, so the listener could more easily pick out the different voices. I developed a little theme that begins with the flute, then the tubular bells accompany it. Following this repetition, however, both melodies drift away. With a wave-shaped melody, the flute is more unstable, with a descending melody in bar 3 and an ascending melody until bar 5. In the meantime, the tubular bells are more stable, using almost always the same rhythm except for bar 7 when they take the opportunity of the calmer flute to express themselves.</p>

<h4 id="exercise-4">Exercise 4</h4>



<p>Similarly to the previous exercise, I tried to start one melody after another, while the instruments followed a similar theme. I could see how this theme could be used in different ways if it were a longer composition. Thus, for example, the xylophone plays two notes on the first part of the theme while the bassoon plays staccato over the same notes. However, after this repetition, the melodies go the opposite way. Generally, they move oppositely, except in the last bar when both move down and up to the final F.</p>
