										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In part 5 of this unit, I explored the role harmony plays in music. To put my research into practice, I composed some exercises to practise chord progressions. The result was that I gained a deeper understanding of how chord harmony supports a melody.</p>



<p>In part 4, I introduced chords through tuned percussion instruments; in part 5, I took it a step further with the piano. As a result, I was able to create a more complex and interesting sound, but it also posed some new challenges. For example, how to create chords that go beyond the simple triad or how to utilize arpeggios instead of chords to keep the sound moving.</p>



<p>In order to provide a fresh perspective to my listening log, my tutor suggested that I listen to contemporary classical music artists. My experience with this was quite interesting as I once again ventured outside of my comfort zone and discovered some inspiring artists.</p>



<h5 id="about-assignment-5">About Assignment 5</h5>



<p>So far, this was my favourite assignment. My ability to explore various sonorities and the introduction of the piano opened up many possibilities for me.</p>



<p>Even though I did not go far outside my comfort zone as I did in assignment four, I tried to create some familiar-sounding passages while adding some novel and unusual parts that I am not entirely sure are good.</p>



<p>The cyclic chord progression was useful in constructing the melody, and I used it five times with two different chord progressions.</p>



<p>In the previous parts of this unit, we&#8217;ve learned that if we modify or augment the same sounds, we can be more economical with the material. In this assignment, I tried to do this, and I was very pleased with the results.</p>



<p>Having reviewed all the assignments I completed, I can clearly see how my sense of rhythm and melody developed along with my confidence.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In assignment 5, I had to compose a piece that used Cyclic chord progressions at least four times&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In assignment 5, I had to compose a piece that used Cyclic chord progressions at least four times within a three-minute span. Although I could compose with any instruments of my choice, I was asked to avoid using a Perfect Cadence until the very end of the piece.</p>



<p>You can find the final score <a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-final-Full-Score.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-final-Full-Score.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and listen to it below:</p>



<p></p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme">The Idea / Theme</h2>



<p>I decided to use what I learned from my research on tango in this assignment and create a tango-inspired piece. The reason I would not call it a Tango is that I feel I need to dig deeper to find out what makes a memorable Tango piece, and mainly because I don&#8217;t want to offend tango lovers.</p>



<p>Additionally, I had fun playing with the element of surprise in my last assignment. Even though the use of cyclic chord progressions may mean repetition, I aim to include some unexpected elements in this piece to prevent it from becoming monotonous.</p>



<p>Regarding the theme, I believe that tango is much about passion and desire, so this piece is about love in all its forms. For instance, it can include passionate love, admiration for a friend, or care for a family member. All of these types of love have one thing in common: they are never linear. They have ups and downs, calm moments, passionate moments, turbulent moments. If it is true love, everything will finally make sense and end in a perfect cadence.</p>



<p>As with all relationships, both parties have unique personalities. Due to this, I chose two woodwind instruments (Flute and Oboe) with a narrator (Piano) to lead the listener through the piece.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="structure">Structure</span></h2>



<p>The structure is based on the concept that each voice has a chance to &#8220;speak&#8221; and then interact with the other voice. As a result, the structure becomes A-B-C-B&#8217;-A&#8217;, where A is dominated by the personality of the first voice, B is dominated by the personality of the second voice, and C is where they interact.</p>



<p>I selected the key of B minor for no particular reason other than it sounded good with a theme I was playing on the piano. Later in the C section, I wanted to modulate to the dominant key, in this case, F# minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section &amp; Triad</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The oboe presents itself as a more mellow and melodic voice</td><td>A &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~50 seconds at 75 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Flute enters with a more rhythm and fast-paced character</td><td>B &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~40 seconds at 95 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Their interactions are sometimes in harmony, but sometimes in discord</td><td>C &#8211; F# minor</td><td>~30 seconds at 80 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Despite their differences, they try to live together</td><td>B&#8217; &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~20 seconds at 75 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Talking about it in turns, they eventually arrive at a consensus</td><td>A&#8217; &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~30 seconds at 95 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-motifs">The Motifs</span></h2>



<p>From the beginning, I knew I wanted two motifs, one for the flute and one for the oboe. Each motif must be different and appear throughout the piece.</p>



<p>The oboe motif is more melodic and romantic, which I think is perfect for an oboe in the middle range.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="82" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1024x82.png" alt="" class="wp-image-651" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1024x82.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-300x24.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-768x62.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1536x123.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-2048x164.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-640x51.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-960x77.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The oboe and piano play a fraction of this motif in bars 29-30.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="339" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-1024x339.png" alt="" class="wp-image-652" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-1024x339.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-300x99.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-768x254.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-1536x509.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-2048x678.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-640x212.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-960x318.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>All instruments repeat this fraction in bars 62-66.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="824" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-824x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-655" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-824x1024.png 824w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-242x300.png 242w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-768x954.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-1237x1536.png 1237w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-1649x2048.png 1649w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-300x373.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-640x795.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-960x1192.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>Unlike the first voice, the flute&#8217;s motif is mostly semiquavers and is more rhythmic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="291" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-1024x291.png" alt="" class="wp-image-654" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-1024x291.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-300x85.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-768x219.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-1536x437.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-2048x583.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-640x182.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-960x273.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>All instruments repeat this motif in bars 51-53.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="824" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-824x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-656" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-824x1024.png 824w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-242x300.png 242w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-768x954.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-1237x1536.png 1237w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-1649x2048.png 1649w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-300x373.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-640x795.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-960x1192.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>This motif is augmented by the piano in bars 55-58.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="94" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-1024x94.png" alt="" class="wp-image-657" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-1024x94.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-300x27.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-768x70.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-1536x141.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-2048x188.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-640x59.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-960x88.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The piece also includes a note-descending motif that does not belong to any particular instrument and is played throughout in order to tie all sections together. It first appears in bars 5 and 6 on the oboe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="79" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-1024x79.png" alt="" class="wp-image-658" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-1024x79.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-300x23.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-768x59.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-1536x119.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-2048x158.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-640x50.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-960x74.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The flute plays a version of it in bars 22-23 and 28-29.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="100" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-1024x100.png" alt="" class="wp-image-659" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-1024x100.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-300x29.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-768x75.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-1536x151.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-2048x201.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-640x63.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-960x94.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Bars 22-23</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="111" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-1024x111.png" alt="" class="wp-image-660" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-1024x111.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-300x33.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-768x83.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-1536x167.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-2048x223.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-640x70.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-960x104.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Bars 28-29</figcaption></figure>



<p>The flute plays this motif in bars 33-34 (inside its own motif), but it has been slighlty transformed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="131" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-1024x131.png" alt="" class="wp-image-661" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-1024x131.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-300x38.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-768x98.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-1536x196.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-2048x262.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-640x82.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-960x123.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In bars 58-59, the piano and flute repeat this motif.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="532" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-1024x532.png" alt="" class="wp-image-662" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-1024x532.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-300x156.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-768x399.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-1536x798.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-2048x1064.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-640x332.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-960x499.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-rhytms">The Rhytms</span></h2>



<p>Tango is much about rhythm, so I tried to convey it in this piece. As I found out in my research on tango, there are two distinct accompaniment rhythms: marcato and síncopa. Most of this piece uses síncopa, as for example at the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-instruments">The Instruments</span></h2>



<p>I began to think about the piece at this point. We were told that we could use any instrument of our choice, but the hint was that we could use the piano as well. Because I had never composed for the piano before, I decided to research what woodwind instruments were used with the piano. I chose the piano &#8211; flute &#8211; oboe combination because I enjoyed listening to it more.</p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-composition">The Composition</span></h2>



<p><strong>Section A </strong>Bars 1-20</p>



<p>The first part of this section is dominated by the piano and the oboe, with the latter providing a more melodic voice. There&#8217;s something a bit romantic and a little cliché about this melody, giving me a gentle humming of Carlos Gardel&#8217;s voice. In order to convey that this is an inspired piece of tango music, I made this intentionally.</p>



<p>In this section, the chord progression is i &#8211; ii° &#8211; iv &#8211; III &#8211; VII⁶. I developed this progression because I wanted to begin with only minor chords and move to major chords in the last part.</p>



<p>This chord progression is broken up in a transition to the B section using a classic tango rhythm and letting the piano alone so the flute can enter more dramatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section B </strong>Bars 21-38</p>



<p>Bars 21-30 (the first ten bars) continue the previous transition with the introduction of the flute in a high E semibreve. A new chord progression is hinted at in bars 26-30, especially when the C major chord is introduced.</p>



<p>The flute&#8217;s motif is introduced with a new chord progression i &#8211; iv &#8211; ♮II &#8211; vi &#8211; V &#8211; VI from bar 31 to bar 34, which is repeated twice until the end of section B.</p>



<p>I wanted both rhythm and harmony to contrast in this section. Despite the fact that the piano uses essentially the same rhythm as section A, the flute uses mostly semiquavers. Harmonically, I introduce some non-diatonic chords that contrast feelings and surprise the listener.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section C </strong>Bars 39-50</p>



<p>In bars 39-42, I chose to take the contrast a step further with a brief modulation to the key of F# minor. Additionally, the rhythm changes to a marcato rhythm that is played throughout section C.</p>



<p>This section is more contrapuntal, where instruments play their own melodies and none of the previous motifs are heard, creating an impression that this is a completely new section.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section B&#8217; </strong>Bars 51-61</p>



<p>The piece returns to its familiarity in section B&#8217; with the previous chord progression i &#8211; iv &#8211; ♮II &#8211; vi &#8211; V &#8211; VI&nbsp;and interplay between instruments that echo a motif from section B. The climax is reached when both woodwind instruments play a high minim. That is the highest note played by the oboe so far.</p>



<p>A piano solo follows, and the piece moves back to a softer sound.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section A&#8217; </strong>Bars 62-68</p>



<p>The final section begins by mimicking the beginning of the B&#8217; section, in which the instruments play the motif of the A section in turn.</p>



<p>The voices calm down until there is a perfect cadence.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I was challenged by my tutor to listen to more contemporary classical music in order to get a&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I was challenged by my tutor to listen to more contemporary classical music in order to get a sense of what they are preoccupied with. After reading that Kaija Saariaho is considered the greatest living composer by BBC Music Magazine (Fiilin, 2019) and that she has been named New York Times Composer of the Year 2021 (Barone, 2021), I chose her.</p>



<p>Having never heard Kaija Saariaho before, her sound was completely new to me.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">Kaija Saariaho, a Finnish composer born in 1952, studied composition at Sibelius Academy and then relocated to Germany to study at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg. Here she was frustrated by all the prohibited things in post-serialist tradition. “You were not allowed to have pulse, or tonally oriented harmonies, or melodies,” she said. “I don’t want to write music through negations. Everything is permissible as long as it’s done in good taste&#8221; (Posner, 2018).</p>



<p>Her first encounter with spectral music occurred in France in 1980, where she eventually settled. Throughout her career, her work has been marked by themes that have been circulating in French music for decades: melody and harmony derived from overtones, and the blending of instrumental and electronic sounds. Her involvement with Pierre Boulez&#8217;s electronic music institute, IRCAM, which he founded in 1977, is extensive (Ross, 2006).</p>



<p>Like Saariaho in 1980, I had never come into contact with spectralism. I found it to be a different approach to music, using overtones to examine sonorities, although it isn&#8217;t something completely novel, in terms of music theory. Western music is built on the building blocks of the overtone series &#8211; the octave, the fourth, the fifth, and the major third. The beauty of this music comes from how the different instruments explore and use these overtones while not becoming dull and boring. </p>



<p>I chose Vista because it is a composition from 2021, and I was curious about what a great composer is working on at the moment. I found this recording of Helsinki City Orchestra and Susanna Mälkki conducting.</p>



<div class="yle_areena_player" data-id="1-50946353"></div><script src="https://player-v2.yle.fi/embed.js" defer></script>



<p>Music has always seemed to me like motion, such as a slice of life that the composer is imagining or a scene from a film that is transcribed into music. But what I found with Saariaho was that music can be compared to a picture. A still moment in time can be described with all the acoustic nuances creating what I believe could be a musical photograph.  </p>



<p>Vista gave me the impression that this was a scene that the composer observeimagined. She is describing it to the listener what it is and how it made her feel.</p>



<p>In Horizons, the scene is a really open one, perhaps a field or the sea. Something she couldn&#8217;t see the end of, perhaps a very flat landscape. The scenery is peaceful, giving you time to take in nature&#8217;s beauty. I would love to see some paintings based on Horizons.</p>



<p>Targets is a completely different landscape, although it uses the same instruments from the previous piece. It is rough, dry, and tumultuous. It feels like this is a mountainous landscape, with sharp geometry everywhere you look. It&#8217;s not prettier or uglier than the landscape in Horizons, but it&#8217;s not a calm place either. Maybe it&#8217;s near the city and you feel the stress coming in.</p>



<p>Vista opened up a new musical world for me, so I enjoyed listening to it. Another great thing about this work is the score, which I found particularly interesting because of the notation for the players and how detailed it was.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In researching Ragtime, I discovered this music style resembled Tango in some ways. As it turns out, ragtime&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In researching Ragtime, I discovered this music style resembled Tango in some ways. As it turns out, ragtime and tango share some rhythmic styles, such as bass syncopation (Berlin, 2013).</p>



<p>As a result, I learned more about Tango and one of its greatest composers: Astor Piazzolla.</p>



<p>Although I had heard Piazzolla before, I hadn&#8217;t listened to his Four Seasons work. Consequently, I decided to listen to it.</p>



<p>Piazzolla was born in Mar del Plata, Argentina, on March 11, 1921. When he was eight years old, his family moved to New York, USA, from where he got his first bandoneon before moving back to Argentina and then again to the USA. As a result of all of this back and forth between Argentina and the US, he was influenced by Tango and Jazz in all of his work (Bach, 1991).</p>



<p>As a 12-year-old, he was already a prolific bandoneon player, until he met Carlos Gardel, one of his idols. He eventually became Gardel&#8217;s translator and bandoneon player as well.</p>



<p>In 1946, Piazzolla moved back to Argentina and formed his own orchestra. He then travelled to France for a Paris Conservatory scholarship. However, his secret goal on this trip to France was to meet Nadia Boulanger, one of the greatest music teachers to ever live (Burton-Hill, 2017). In response to a symphony he composed, she gave him some great advice:&nbsp;&#8220;Something is missing You sound like Ravel, Bartok, Stravinsky, Hindemith but you don&#8217;t sound like Piazzolla. Where is Astor Piazzolla in all this? What do you do!&#8221; (Bach, 1991).</p>



<p>Nadia Boulanger encouraged Piazzolla to pursue what would become known as the New Tango, a unique fusion of tango, jazz, and classical music. His favourite instruments for tango nuevo were the bandoneon, violin, bass, piano, and electric guitar.</p>



<p>I can hear all of these influences in his Buenos Aires Four Seasons, or in the original title Las Cuatro Estaciones Porteñas.</p>



<p>As opposed to Vivaldi&#8217;s Four Seasons, Piazzolla treated the four pieces separately rather than as a single suite. The summer was written in 1965, the winter in 1969, and the spring and autumn in 1970. However, he sometimes performed them together in concerts. In this composition, the four seasons are presented with the focus on Buenos Aires, meaning that each season is seen and heard through the eyes and ears of a city bursting with life and activity.</p>



<p>In 1998, Leonid Desyatnikov composed a new arrangement linked to Vivaldi&#8217;s work for solo violin and string orchestra. Instead of listening to this arrangement, I will listen to the original bandoneon arrangement played by Piazzolla.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Astor Piazzolla - Las cuatro estaciones porteñas (Compilado)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6Jv_JrjJIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>It was generally very enjoyable, particularly the contrast between energetic and almost chaotic forces and subtle and gentle melodies. All of the &#8220;seasons&#8221; follow some kind of fast-slow-fast pattern, which makes them feel very different from what traditional tango used to be.</p>



<p>In traditional tango, the time signature is 4/4 and there are two simple rhythms: marcato, where there are four marks on the beat; and síncopa, where there is an off-beat pattern that includes a number of variations like the most famous Habanera. In Piazzolla&#8217;s&nbsp;Las Cuatro Estaciones Porteñas, I can hear both rhythms but particularly Autumn has a very interesting habanera rhythm.</p>



<p><strong>Spring</strong></p>



<p>The city is waking up from a rainy winter and moving towards sunny days in the spring. In a way, spring is the beginning of life. This is especially evident in this piece where the violin makes a sound that sounds almost like a shout of joy, at mark 01:00. People start moving out of their houses and partying on the streets.</p>



<p>Around 02:30, the calmer part begins and I believe this is a time for romance. As the Spring lovers appear and the seduction begins, Piazzolla demonstrates that Tango is not just about the party and energetic rhythms, it can also be about beautiful and tranquil melodies.</p>



<p>We return to the energetic motif at 03:20 because spring is about letting go of all the tension accumulated during the winter and enjoying the wonderful weather outside.</p>



<p><strong>Summer</strong></p>



<p>Summer in Buenos Aires is extremely hot, making it difficult to spend time outside during the day. I believe that&#8217;s why this piece is not as energetic as Spring. There is some repetition within the melody itself because that is what the heat does to you. Everything becomes more lethargic. The joy returns in the late afternoon and evening. During mark 09:30, we hear the same shouts of joy as in the Spring piece, as well as a hint of celebration and romance.</p>



<p>Piazzolla&#8217;s violin solo brings back the lethargy of the very hot and humid summer of Buenos Aires because perhaps in his mind the daytime has returned.</p>



<p>The joy returns at the end with a bit of joy and síncopa to help bring about a festive mood with the end of summer and colder days to come.</p>



<p><strong>Autumn</strong></p>



<p>While spring is the season for birth, Autumn brings a sense of death and tranquillity. Particularly at mark 17:00, the previous violin shouts have less power and sound almost sad. It brings melancholy to our ears with the nostalgia of spring and summer and the anticipation of a cold winter that comes slowly to us. I feel that by the end of this piece. There are huge, heavy steps of coming winter.</p>



<p><strong>Winter</strong></p>



<p>During the winter, the city moves indoors. Because everything is a little calmer and colder, the tango sounds a little warmer as if it could warm the heart of the dancers. In this piece, I believe Piazzolla envisioned couples dancing close to each other to this tango in order to warm each other and maybe have a little romance in the winter.</p>



<p>The electric guitar sound is quite dominant in this piece, which I believe is meant to emphasize the warm sound needed for the cold winter, just like a musical fireplace.</p>



<p>In the second half, the music starts to gain energy, probably trying to make the anticipation of the Spring to come.</p>



<p>Around mark 26:00, the sound shifts into classical, perhaps a nod to Vivaldi&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>Because of my research on Cadenza, I ended up listening to Beethoven&#8217;s Piano Concerto No. 5, specially the first movement Allegro. In my opinion, this concerto is a perfect example of Beethoven&#8217;s ability to infuse rhythm, depth a power into music. </p>



<p>This first movement starts with a rather unusual presentation of the orchestra and the solo instrument, in this case the piano. The orchestra plays open chords while the piano plays  flourishes of arpeggios, trills, and scales.</p>



<p>Then comes the theme, which in my opinion is a very powerful and almost a fanfare. </p>

<p>The development shows all the creative genius of Beethoven, who created a stunning piece that contains a repeating themes and different elaborations of them by both the orchestra and the piano. </p>



<p>One thing I found interesting is the duality of the piano &#8211; orchestra, because from my listening I think that the piano is more experimental and spontaneous, while the orchestra tends to stay more predictable and harmonious. I believe this was a deliberate thought of Beethoven to create some tension and interest in this 20 minute movement.</p>



<p>The cadenza of Piano Concerto No. 5 a.k.a. Emperor Concerto is a very short part of this piece and it was written by Beethoven, probably because he was unable to perform it and wanted to control all the narrative of this concerto. Following this Emperor Concerto, writing the cadenzas became a common feature among contemporary composers (Lindeman, 1995).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the things I&#8217;m finding most interesting in this course is that I&#8217;m putting names and concepts in things I loved about music. It happened with counterpoint and it happened now with cadenza.</p>



<p>Cadenza is, according to The Oxford Dictionary of Music, &#8220;a flourish (properly, improvised) inserted into the final cadence of any section of a vocal aria or a solo instr movement&#8221; (Kennedy, Kennedy and Rutherford-Johnson, 2012). This music usually culminates in an extended trill, after which the orchestra re-enters, bringing the movement to a speedy conclusion, more often than not without any further participation from the soloist.</p>



<p>The practice of cadenzas originated in vocal music where singers improvised at certain cadences within an aria. The general rule for vocal music was that the cadenza would last no longer than a breath. Composers preferred that performers keep their cadenzas short to prevent interference with the structure of the aria. Since Mozart and Beethoven were writing for their own performances, they felt no inclination to keep things and took this opportunity to show their flashy keyboard skills (Fuller, n.d.).</p>



<p> In other words, it can be described as a parenthesis in music, where the author (in the case of a written cadenza) or the player (in the case of an improvised cadenza) take the liberty of getting out of the structure of the music and create a new focal point of the piece  (Bribitzer-Stull, Matthew, 2006).</p>



<p>After hearing some cadenzas (shown below) I believe that the cadenza has two main purposes: one in itself and the other within the piece. The first is to showcase the singer/player skills; the second is to anticipate a climactic ending. </p>



<p>Going back to the beginning of this post, now I know what Freddie Mercury (one of my favourite composers) was doing when, for example, he used a little cadenza at the end of Barcelona (at minute 3:50) or a slightly bigger one at the end of the live performance of Somebody To Love (at minute 5:00). In both examples, he was showcasing the vocal skills of the singer (Montserrat Caballé&#8217;s skill in the first example, which can be thought of a melisma) and leading the music into an apotheotic ending. </p>

<p>Maybe there are other examples of cadenzas in more popular music, but I can&#8217;t find them. Below are the classical examples I listened to.</p>



<h5 id="wolfgang-amadeus-mozart-piano-concerto-no-20-in-d-minor-k-466-mvt-1-allegro">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart &#8211; Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466. Mvt. 1: Allegro</h5>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KHvNDn-o0s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>This is one of the most cited cadenzas I found through all articles I read. Probably because it joins the work of two geniouses: Mozart&#8217;s concerto and Beethoven&#8217;s cadenza. Mozart&#8217;s Piano Concerto was given its premiere in Vienna on 1785, with the composer at the piano, but sadly, Mozart&#8217;s own cadenza was lost. A few years later in 1809, Beethoven wrote his own. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s full of contrasts and unexpected twists and turns and a fantastic final stretched with a trill that lasts several bars before the orchestra comes in. I was expecting a more virtuosic challenge for the pianist, but what I believe Beethoven achieved was a more emotional and impassioned cadenza.</p>



<h5 id="beethoven-piano-concerto-no-5-in-e-flat-major-op-73">Beethoven &#8211; Piano Concerto No. 5 in E flat major op. 73</h5>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This cadenza that appears near the end of the first movement, was written by the composer itself and it is a really short but elaborate part of this piece. What I found interesting about this cadenza is that it fits the whole movement very well. It comes from the main theme and makes the passage to another theme.</p>



<p>Before the cadenza, the orchestra plays the powerful dotted quaver &#8211; semi quaver &#8211; crochet chords while the piano anticipates a bit of the cadenza. Then the short cadenza starts full of rhythm but then gently eases back into the tutti by accompanying the end of the “cadenza” with a horn theme. </p>



<h5 id="brahms-violin-concerto-in-d-major-op-77">Brahms &#8211; Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 77</h5>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Brahms wrote one violin concerto and it was dedicated to Joseph Joachim. The cadenza appears in the end of Mvt.1 and I believe it is full of passion and melancholy at the same time. It explores the violin capabilites, which fits the purpose of a cadenza: to showcase the player&#8217;s and instrument virtuosities.</p>



<p>The dissonant notes and the strikes on the chords convey a bit of rage that I specially aprecciate. With the runs, I felt that it had some rock and metal sound I used to listen to. It brought me memories of the extended electric guitar solos that showcased the guitarist skills.</p>



<p>In the end, the entering of the orchestra is much smoother than the Mozart&#8217;s piano concerto, and I believe this creates a great contrast with the cadenza, almost like it is a resolution of the violin&#8217;s anger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For part 4 of this unit, I had the opportunity to explore how a counterpoint composition can be developed with the main subject as the focal point. Bach&#8217;s fugues proved to be of great importance here.</p>



<p>I also explored tuned percussion instruments for the first time. I found them varied and versatile. I will certainly explore composition with the timpani and the glockenspiel.</p>



<p>As a result of listening to Ragtime, I also developed a better understanding of rhythm and syncopation in some compositions.</p>



<h3 id="about-assignment-4">About Assignment 4</h3>



<p>So far, this assignment has been the most challenging. The assignment was difficult for me for a number of reasons, but I suspect it was the challenge of writing something different that I placed on myself.</p>



<p>In general, I am not pleased with the composition. It has some parts that I like, especially the motif and some rhythmic details in section C, but as a whole, it doesn&#8217;t appeal to me as much as some of my other compositions.</p>



<p>Despite being aware that a university is a place where people take chances, I will attempt to create something I&#8217;m more familiar with in the next assignment to increase my self-confidence.</p>

		<span>The Idea / Theme</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Having felt that my previous assignments were a bit on the safe side, I decided to incorporate the element of surprise into this assignment. It was important for me to try things I hadn&#8217;t done before. I wanted to go to places that made me uncomfortable and use my ingenuity to see if I could surprise myself.</p>



<p>Regarding the theme, along with the idea of surprise, this piece will be about a party, for instance, a wedding, where a dance will be performed by two voices. Then something goes wrong between these two voices, maybe an argument or an altercation that completely changes the mood. Ultimately, both parties reach an agreement and get back to dancing.</p>



<h2 id="the-structure" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1634108659753 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Structure</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The idea largely determines the structure. This turns the structure into an A-B-C-A-B. I envision this piece beginning with an intro (A section) that will be in the same key, but rhythmically different from the B section. When we move from the B section to the C section, there will be a change in key, time signature, tempo, and dynamics to create a full contrast. After this section, we return to the intro and then the B section.</p>



<p>The A section will be in a minor key, the B section in a major key, and the C section in a minor key. In this piece, I will start in the key of E minor, then move to its relative major key of G major. In the C section, I will use the key of B minor, which is a fifth from the key of E minor, because I want to create some contrast without sounding too abrupt.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular cnvs-block-core-table-1628498574118"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section &amp; Triad</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The instruments present themselves and get in the mood for the party</td><td>A &#8211; E minor</td><td>~20 seconds at 75 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>They party and dance together with one instrument initiating the dance and the other following</td><td>B &#8211; G major</td><td>~50 seconds at 95 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>Tension builds up and there&#8217;s a fight</td><td>C &#8211; B minor</td><td>~40 seconds at 80 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>They come into agreement and return to get themselves in the mood for part</td><td>A&#8217; &#8211; E minor</td><td>~20 seconds at 75 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>They slowly return to the dance and party until the end</td><td>B&#8217; &#8211; G major</td><td>~50 seconds at 95 bpm </td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>As I was playing around with the piano, I came up with a motif (in red) that started short and developed into a bigger subject.</p>

</h2>



<p>Having reviewed a recent video from Philharmonia, I decided to choose the vibraphone because of the sustained sound it produces.</p>

<p>I decided to go with the bassoon for the woodwind instrument again because I am finding it to be much more versatile than I had anticipated.</p>



<p>The combination of these instruments seemed unusual to me, and I was not wrong. Youtube and Spotify returned few results, but I found this performance of a piece by Alexandre Ouzounoff that encouraged me to continue experimenting with these two instruments.</p>

<p><strong>Section A</strong> Bars 1-6</p>



<p>As an introduction to the piece, I composed a short section with both instruments presenting themselves in different moods: the bassoon is strong and sustained, and the vibraphone is fast and harmonious.</p>



<p>I was inspired by Stravinsky&#8217;s bassoon solo in Rite Of Spring to start the piece on a high sustained note.</p>

<p>This introduction ends abruptly to convey the main idea of a piece with surprise elements.</p>



<p><strong>Section B</strong> Bars 7-26</p>



<p>Here, the time signature changes and the bassoon plays the main subject, copied by the vibraphone. With the bassoon playing a countersubject in E in bar 13, the vibraphone is now free to play the main subject in G, which now is a major third.</p>



<p>In bar 20, the bassoon returns to the main theme but starts in C, which is a major 4th of G. The vibraphone continues to fill the room with ascending and descending notes.</p>



<p>Both instruments start ascending melodies in bar 23, which leads to a climax and the end of this section.</p>



<p><strong>Section C</strong> Bars 27-40</p>



<p>The section begins with a low dynamic and just the vibraphone playing. Although the key changes to B minor, I wanted to create another level of surprise and ambiguity, so I played an F major chord on the high notes, while the low notes created dissonance.</p>



<p>This section motif is then played by the bassoon, accompanied by a steady rhythm played by the vibraphone. Sometimes the vibraphone completes a triad, such as the A major in bar 28, but sometimes it just plays dissonant tones.</p>



<p>In the absence of harmony between the instruments, the tension rises with minor triads and the tempo increases.</p>



<p>At Bar 36, both instruments play staccato, and the tempo is the fastest in the entire piece. The vibraphone continues with its ascending and descending melody, while the bassoon is more steady in its notes.</p>



<p>At the end, in bar 40, they are both tired of the previous part and rest in minim notes before concluding with a B major triad.</p>



<p><strong>Section A&#8217;</strong> Bars 41-43</p>



<p>The section starts with a chord in G major, marking a key change, and proceeds into a version of the intro.</p>



<p><strong>Section B</strong>&#8216; Bars 44-67</p>



<p>In this section, a bassoon augmented subject is played while the vibraphone plays the motif, followed by a counterpoint.</p>



<p>In bar 56, the bassoon plays an inversion of the subject while the vibraphone plays parts of the motif and triads.</p>



<p>In bar 62, the bassoon plays the main motif, which is quickly repeated by the vibraphone in increasing tones until they both end in a G.</p>

<p>I felt this fugue was really lovely, especially because I enjoyed the theme and Bach used it frequently throughout this composition. In fact, I thought this fugue was quite theme-centric, with the theme inverted, augmented, and rhythmically varied. It’s also worth noting that this fugue goes from a straightforward exposition to a three-voiced narrative.</p>



<p>To be clear, some sources indicate that this fugue is in Eb minor; nevertheless, the prelude is in Eb minor, but the fugue is in D# minor in most scores I discovered. Although I don’t believe it matters, I’ll keep mentioning that this fugue is in D# minor.</p>



<p>This fugue begins with the first voice exposition of the theme, while the second voice (in red) imitate it. Right away, the lowest voice repeats it a second time. Bach repeats this three-bar theme four times in the first 14 bars, which shows how important this theme is to him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-1024x614.png" alt="" class="wp-image-544" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-1024x614.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-300x180.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-768x461.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-1536x921.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-640x384.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1-960x576.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.15.14-1.png 1884w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In order to emphasize the theme-centric nature of the fugue, the theme is repeated five times from bar 19 to bar 29, before there is an inversion (in blue). I was interested to see if the inversion is an exact mirror of the theme. I got my answer right away: no. The very first note, D#, goes to an A#, the perfect fifth. However, the inversion goes down a perfect fourth. Following these first notes, everything is mirrored.</p>

<p>Afterwards, the lower voice plays an augmentation of the theme (in green) at double speed. In my opinion, this is where the piece begins to climax and become more complex.</p>

<p>It is difficult for me to follow and analyze without assistance from here. I noticed that the theme is imitated and reversed as well as amplified and augmented throughout the entire piece, making it a complex and engaging ending.</p>

<p>I found this fugue to be slow, sorrowful, but at the same time, I found it to sometimes be beautifully harmonious. Contrary to other fugues I have heard, I believe this could be played in a church, with the long notes resonating in the long walls. Alternatively, a choral group could perform it.</p>



<p>The theme (in red) and countertheme (in brown) are presented in the first six bars of this fugue, which is interesting. The theme’s long notes are precisely counterbalanced by the countertheme’s quavers, allowing both to be heard clearly. When the third voice is added in the lower bass, it sounds really lovely to me. This produces a really fascinating and recognizable sound that binds all of the voices together.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1008" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-1024x1008.png" alt="" class="wp-image-548" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-1024x1008.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-300x295.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-768x756.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-80x80.png 80w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-640x630.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-960x945.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I was curious as to how Bach composed the theme and counter-theme to work together so beautifully, so I decided to investigate further. One thing I observed is that both melodies, especially the countertheme, move in a step-by-step manner, only leaping in the finish. This, I believe, allows the intervals to move from fifths to thirds, as seen at the start of bar 5. In addition, the opposing motion in the first two bars, when one of the melodies rises (in red) and the other falls (in blue), generates a lovely contrast and tension, which is released in the last two bars, when both move in the same direction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="678" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-1024x678.png" alt="" class="wp-image-549" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-1024x678.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-300x199.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-768x508.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-640x424.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-960x635.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43.png 1496w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When I previously stated that I considered this piece to be quite harmonic at moments, I was making reference to bars 13 and 14. All melodies, I suppose, have the same function here: to set the stage for the return of the theme and countertheme, but this time in a more powerful form. The theme is mostly played by the two upper voices with the thirds. This brings the piece to a close with a mini-climax.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1001" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-1001x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-550" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-1001x1024.png 1001w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-293x300.png 293w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-768x786.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-1501x1536.png 1501w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-300x307.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-640x655.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-960x982.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10.png 1604w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" /></figure>



<p>Something new appears later, at the conclusion of bar 20. The motif has been inverted (in blue). This inversion is accompanied by lower voice quavers that sound like the countertheme. I believe this is employed to have a familiar sound with this new inversion theme.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="724" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-1024x724.png" alt="" class="wp-image-551" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-1024x724.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-300x212.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-768x543.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-1536x1087.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-640x453.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-960x679.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16.png 1668w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One last thing I’d like to mention is something I don’t recall hearing in previous fugues. When two voices play similar melodies while the other two wait their time to play identical tunes. As with prior examples, most of this is done using the third interval. All of this builds up to the final theme and countertheme section.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the first exercise for a two-part experience, I aimed to compose something similar to what I heard from Bach and a more &#8220;traditional&#8221; invention. After reading about invention, I gathered some process rules that allow to write an invention.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Write a motif in one voice</li><li>The second voice repeats the motif in another octave</li><li>The first voice imitates the motif on the dominant</li><li>The second voice imitates the motif it played before but this time on the dominant</li><li>Then use parts or the whole motif in augmented, diminuted or inversed version while the other voice plays counterpoint</li><li>End in the tonic</li></ul>



<p>Although I know these are not stric rules, I tried to apply the process here to help me compose faster and with fewer elements. I must say I liked this process. I started with a motif that is played in both voices on the tonic and on the dominant. I then passed to both voices playing a diminuted version of the motif and ending with the oboe playing a inversion while the bassoon plays a augmented motif. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="722" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-12-1-722x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-611" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-12-1-722x1024.png 722w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-12-1-212x300.png 212w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-12-1-768x1089.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-12-1-1083x1536.png 1083w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-12-1-1445x2048.png 1445w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-12-1-300x425.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-12-1-640x907.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-12-1-960x1361.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-12-1.png 2222w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" /></figure>



<p>In my second exercise, I tried to apply a more rhythmic invention while using the marimba. As in the first exercise, I created a motif that is repeated and imitated by both voices. I didn&#8217;t feel the need to augment the motif since I got the sense that I would lose the rhytm of it, so I used an diminuted version of the motif in the marimba while the flute plays an inversion.</p>

<p>One thought occurred to me while I was searching for music to listen to. What is the reason for the scarcity of well-known African classical composers? I couldn&#8217;t think of one, and a quick Google search reveals that the first dozen names that come up are all white men. I recognize that my lack of knowledge stems primarily from my western culture, so I set out to find black composers, which I am glad I did.</p>

<p>One of the articles I read was from classicfm.com entitled <a href="https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/black-composers-who-made-classical-music-history/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/black-composers-who-made-classical-music-history/" target="_blank">&#8220;9 Black composers who changed the course of classical music history&#8221;.</a> The first featured composer is Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges.</p>



<p>Joseph Bologne was born to a wealthy plantation owner and his Senegalese slave mistress in Basse-Terre, Guadaloupe, in 1745. He received the best education his father could afford during the family&#8217;s move to France and grew into an exceptionally gifted student. He had professional training, as evidenced by his extensive work list, which includes a number of comedic operas, symphonies and concertos, as well as chamber works (Banat, 2001).</p>



<p>Despite his pejorative nickname of The Black Mozart (also known as The Other Mozart), I find myself wondering if it shouldn&#8217;t be the other way around. Joseph Bologne is regarded as one of the greatest composers of the 18th century, according to Marlon Daniel. He was known to frequent salons as a guest of the French nobility, including those of queen Marie Antoinette, who was an accomplished singer herself. He influenced Franz Joseph Haydn, François-Joseph Gossec, Carl Stamitz, and, most notably, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, making him a leader rather than a follower of trends in the musical evolution of his century (Daniel, 2021).</p>



<p>His work was innovative since his earlier compositions, according to a New York Times article. &#8220;The six-string quartets of his Opus 1 were among the first in that genre to be written in France. His three sonatas for keyboard and violin (Op. 1a) feature those instruments as equals, breaking away from the Baroque tradition of basso continuo, which was still very much in vogue&#8221; (Balter, 2020).</p>



<p>Despite how innovative Bologne&#8217;s work may have sounded after listening to his violin concertos, my mind constantly tells me that he sounds a lot like some of his contemporaries. This, I believe, is a case of knowledge bias.</p>



<p>His Violin Concerto No. 9 in G Major, Op. 8 is one of my favourite works. I was struck by the three movements&#8217; energy and rhythm, as well as the motifs he created. I couldn&#8217;t find a free score for this piece, but they can easily compete with other well-known motifs, in my humble and naive opinion. Why hasn&#8217;t his music been used in an advertisement commercial?</p>



<p>The second movement, Largo, is one of my favourites. Despite the fact that it is a slower movement, I consider it to be a continuation of the first movement&#8217;s accentuated rhythm. The syncopation provides a solid sound of descending notes in the first minute, which I find pleasing. In fact, I find this movement to be quite contemporary. While listening to him, I noticed parallels with Nicolas Britell&#8217;s, in my opinion, amazing Succession Tv Show soundtrack, particularly the Adagio in C Minor I show below.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In the end, I was thrilled about this discovery. I&#8217;m not qualified to say whether Joseph Bologne was a better composer than Mozart, but after hearing some of his works, I believe he deserves at least more credit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During this project, I had to practice composing counterpoints for two instruments. There were two parts to the brief. With exercises 1 and 2, one of the instruments is already provided in the briefing, and the challenge is to compose a counterpoint for it. The task in exercises 3 and 4 is to compose two tunes with contrasting characters.</p>



<p>The workbook states that any tuning percussion instrument and woodwind instrument may be used. In order to get more familiar with tuned percussion, I decided to use them in all exercises.</p>



<h4 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h4>



<p>With this exercise, the top melody was provided and I was asked to compose the bottom melody. As I looked at the written melody for the first time, I noticed that it had long notes, mirims, and crochets, so I decided to use mostly quavers and semiquavers to have a nice rhythmic contrast. I also took advantage of the opportunity to contrast the dynamics, sometimes having the vibraphone play higher than the flute.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="329" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-1024x329.png" alt="" class="wp-image-521" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-1024x329.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-300x96.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-768x246.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-1536x493.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-2048x657.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-640x205.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-960x308.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1.png 2163w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h4>



<p>Here, the bottom part was given, and I composed the top melody. With the first three bars of my melody, I worked with the staccato from the flute by adding semiquavers, resulting in an interaction between the two instruments. In the next three bars, I made the marimba melody follow the descending flute melody, but with fast notes to emphasize the different melodies. The marimba contrasts with the flute in the last three bars by going up while the flute continues to go down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="577" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-1024x577.png" alt="" class="wp-image-522" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-1024x577.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-768x433.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-1536x866.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-2048x1154.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-640x361.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-960x541.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2.png 2166w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h4>



<p>In the third exercise, I followed the workbook&#8217;s suggestion and started one melody later than the other, so the listener could more easily pick out the different voices. I developed a little theme that begins with the flute, then the tubular bells accompany it. Following this repetition, however, both melodies drift away. With a wave-shaped melody, the flute is more unstable, with a descending melody in bar 3 and an ascending melody until bar 5. In the meantime, the tubular bells are more stable, using almost always the same rhythm except for bar 7 when they take the opportunity of the calmer flute to express themselves.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="662" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-1024x662.png" alt="" class="wp-image-523" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-1024x662.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-300x194.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-768x497.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-1536x994.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-2048x1325.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-640x414.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-960x621.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 id="exercise-4">Exercise 4</h4>



<p>Similarly to the previous exercise, I tried to start one melody after another, while the instruments followed a similar theme. I could see how this theme could be used in different ways if it were a longer composition. Thus, for example, the xylophone plays two notes on the first part of the theme while the bassoon plays staccato over the same notes. However, after this repetition, the melodies go the opposite way. Generally, they move oppositely, except in the last bar when both move down and up to the final F.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Moving from monophonic to polyphonic music, in my opinion, was a significant step forward in terms of both complexity and creativity.</p>



<p>I had the opportunity to write for three instruments in this assignment, which proved to be more difficult than I anticipated, especially considering I had to write separate melodies for each of them. I can now better appreciate how great composers like Bach were able to compose in masterful harmony when they used 4 or more voices.</p>



<p>My hearing and analysis of rounds, descants, and, especially, polyphony, I believe, aided me in better understanding how voices might be written in harmony but with differing melodies.</p>



<h3 id="about-assignment-3">About Assignment 3</h3>



<p>As I previously stated, I found this task to be far more challenging than the prior two. Considering three instruments, each with their distinct melodies and &#8220;personalities,&#8221; brought a level of difficulty I hadn&#8217;t anticipated. However, I believe that this additional complexity will be advantageous in the long run as assignment tasks become longer and include more instruments.</p>



<p>In terms of notation, I made an effort to avoid some of the faults I made in earlier assignments, such as rhythmic spelling, correct beaming, and phrasing.</p>



<p>My ability to construct a two-minute composition and transpose the concepts I had in my head to a score surprised me. I wanted to compose a piece that put polyphony to work for the music rather than the other way around. The repeated theme and various small melodies throughout the music, I believe, made this polyphonic composition both familiar and fresh at the same time.</p>



<p>Being self-critical, I think this piece contains too many elements. As a result, I feel that I could turn this into a 4-minute musical piece that develops some of the ideas I wanted to include.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>My third task was to compose a work for three woodwind instruments in a mostly polyphonic approach. This composition should last about two minutes and follow a predetermined structure (seen below), in which one begins with a triad, moves to another, and concludes with another.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="358" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47-1024x358.png" alt="" class="wp-image-473" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47-1024x358.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47-300x105.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47-768x268.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47-640x224.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47-960x336.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47.png 1190w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p><meta charset="utf-8">I had few questions after seeing example 45. Should the first triad last several bars? (If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;ll have to use different chords in the meanwhile, or it&#8217;ll sound stuck). Or is the example intended to be regarded as a chord progression that should be used throughout the piece?</p>



<p>My tutor assisted me with these questions by directing me to consider these triads as harmonic centres for the music.</p>



<p>With this in mind, I decided to use three triads, each representing a different essence of the music, resulting in a piece of music with three parts.</p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1634108541003 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Idea / Theme</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>After reflecting on my polyphonic studies, I came up with the idea for this composition. I listened to polyphonic music in three different styles: Renaissance, Baroque, and African/Polynesian polyphony. Because the assignment&#8217;s predetermined structure required three triads, I challenged myself to write a piece of music in three parts, each inspired by a different style of polyphonic music.</p>



<p>About the theme, this piece will be about a love triangle involving three instruments. After meeting and dancing in an African<meta charset="utf-8">/Polynesian section, they progressed to the baroque section, where they fell in love, then finalized the dance with a passionate and harmonious section (Renaissance), showcasing their love for one another.</p>



<h2 id="the-structure" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1634108659753 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Structure</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The structure was mostly determined upon the development of the idea. This would be a straightforward story in which A leads to B, which leads to C. I wanted the music to begin rhythmically as if the instruments were dancing together and each had its own individuality. Then, in a more melodic section, the instruments repeat the motif as though they discover something in common and fall in love. Ending in harmony and love, each instrument repeats the same motif but then each plays its own melodic line while respecting the harmony of the others.</p>



<p>I decided to produce a piece in the key of C# major after studying pentatonic scales. The other triads and keys were chosen based on the least amount of note change between them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular cnvs-block-core-table-1628498574118"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section &amp; Triad</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The instruments meet and dance together, each with its own personality</td><td>A &#8211; B major</td><td><meta charset="utf-8">~30 seconds at 110 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>They fall in love, repeating the same motif</td><td>B &#8211; C# major</td><td><meta charset="utf-8">~30 seconds at 70 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>They live happily ever after, each with their own motif but harmonically</td><td>C &#8211; Ab major</td><td>~60 seconds at 70 bpm</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Motifs</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>As I had done with prior projects and assignments, I began playing around with the piano, hoping to find a theme that sounded good to me and would serve as a catapult for this composition. After a time, I came upon a motif that I really loved and decided to go a little deeper into it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="75" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-1024x75.png" alt="" class="wp-image-480" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-1024x75.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-300x22.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-768x57.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-1536x113.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-2048x151.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-640x47.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-960x71.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Because the song is divided into three distinct sections, I thought it would be fascinating if the same motif appeared in each section, but was played differently and by different instruments. This way, something would connect all three pieces.</p>



<p>This motif is performed subtly in semiquavers in the A section by the oboe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="238" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-1024x238.png" alt="" class="wp-image-476" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-1024x238.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-768x178.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-1536x356.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-2048x475.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-640x149.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-960x223.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The B section is played more explicitly and with quavers by the flute.</p>

<p>The motif is performed by the bassoon nearly in the background with crochets in the C section.</p>

<p>This division was quite helpful in enabling me to start writing each section quicker.</p>

<p>Flute, oboe, and bassoon were my natural choices for a woodwind trio. I chose these three instruments because I believe they complement each other in terms of timbre while remaining distinct enough for the listener to hear each one&#8217;s melody.</p>



<p>I listened to three pieces to gain a sense of how a trio of woodwinds works together and how other composers used these instruments.</p>



<p>One of the first instances I found of the three I selected to work with was Antonio Vivaldi&#8217;s Concerto for Flute, Oboe, and Bassoon in G Minor, RV 103. This composition didn&#8217;t particularly appeal to me, but it did teach me how much prominence the flute can have at times, as well as how the oboe and flute can sound good together without clashing, with the flute in a high register and the oboe in a middle and low register.</p>

<p>The Trio for Flute, Oboe, and Bassoon, Op. 86 by Röntgen was an excellent illustration of what I was attempting. Each instrument&#8217;s identity is respected alongside the melody, yet they also repeat each other. This adds a lot of depth to the music.</p>

<p>Pastorale for Wind Trio, Op. 147 by Darius Milhaud omits the flute but includes the clarinet. I was especially inspired by how wonderfully polyphony worked beginning in bar 24.</p>

		<span>The composition</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section A</strong> Bars 1-9</p>



<p>I intended to portray more rhythmic and fast-paced music in this section. As a result, I employed semiquavers in all three instruments and staccato most of the time.</p>



<p>This section is in the key of B major, although it begins with a D#m triad. The B major triad is present in the second beat of the first bar to create the home triad.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="376" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-1024x376.png" alt="" class="wp-image-481" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-1024x376.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-300x110.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-768x282.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-1536x564.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-2048x752.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-640x235.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-960x352.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23.png 2218w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The oboe and flute begin by playing nearly the identical melody with a 3rd, 5th, or 6th interval, but at bar 4 the flute begins to move from a quick staccato to a slower legato. Meanwhile, the bassoon plays a more danceable melody.</p>



<p>This section has the most triad changes, with the majority being B major, D# minor, F# major and G# minor.</p>



<p>This section ends with a VI &#8211; I, reintroducing the home triad and leading to the next triad.</p>



<p><strong>Section B</strong> Bars 10-20</p>



<p>The music here shifts to a more elaborate yet slower paced approach. The speed is reduced to 70 quaver beats per minute, and the notes are predominantly quavers. In bar 11, the flute plainly states that the key signature has changed to C# major.</p>



<p>The home triad, like the first section, is played right at the start to express the feeling of the new home triad. This time, I stuck with the home triad for a little longer than in&nbsp;the first section, with inversions of the triad lasting two bars and the primary motif repeated by the three instruments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="360" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-1024x360.png" alt="" class="wp-image-483" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-1024x360.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-300x106.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-768x270.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-1536x540.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-2048x720.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-640x225.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-960x338.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6.png 2218w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In contrast to the preceding section, this one contains a clearly defined chord progression: I &#8211; IV &#8211; iii &#8211; V.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="771" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-1024x771.png" alt="" class="wp-image-484" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-1024x771.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-300x226.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-768x578.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-1536x1156.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-2048x1541.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-640x482.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-960x722.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7.png 2222w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It ends with an I &#8211; IV, which leads to the next triad, that is expected to be the V: G# major.</p>



<p><strong>Section C</strong> Bars 21-40</p>



<p>Despite the fact that the tempo remains constant, I wanted the music to feel slower and more harmonized. As a result, I utilized a lot of crochets, minims, and semibreves.</p>



<p>This section is in the key of Ab major. I wanted it to be in G# major scale, but I learned that G# major isn&#8217;t commonly used because it&#8217;s too complex for practical use, and that Ab major is a better option.</p>



<p>In contrast to the other sections, I do not explicitly tell the listener of the key change. Though I begin with the Ab major triad, it isn&#8217;t until the third beat of the second bar of this section (bar 22) that I reach an Ab major triad.</p>



<p>In the final part of this section I wanted to express pure polyphony, with each instrument adding their own melody one at a time, culminating with all three instruments playing distinct melodies until they rise to end in Ab major triad.</p>

<p>Before I could listen to polyphonic music, I needed to define polyphony. There are three types of music textures: monophonic, homophonic, and polyphonic (Copland, Rich and Slatkin, 2011).</p>



<p>So far, I&#8217;ve largely studied monophonic music, which is music composed using a single tune. It does not imply that the music is limited to a single instrument or vocal. Monophonic music can feature percussion and many lines, but they all play the same melody at the same time.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s contemporary popular music is predominantly homophonic. It means that a principal melody is accompanied by a chordal accompaniment. Generally, it is more pleasant to hear than monophonic music because the harmony is played in a way that elevates the main melody.</p>



<p>Polyphony is more challenging than the preceding two. It occurs when two or more melodies happen at the same moment but are unrelated to one another. One of the most distinguishing characteristics of polyphony is that it is difficult to discern which melody is the primary one because each has its own prominence.</p>



<p>I was reminded of a pop tune that contains all three types of musical textures. Come On Eileen by Dexys Midnight Runners makes it simple to understand the three principles. The song begins with a single violin playing in a monophonic texture. The sound then shifts to a homophonic texture, primarily in the chorus. Finally, in the bridge portion, all voices join together in a polyphonic texture with up to three melodies, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Proceeding to my listening of polyphonic music, I decided that it will consist of as many listenings as there are melodies, plus one. To do this, I will try to listen to each melody separately and then all of them together in one final listening.</p>

<p>This is a polyphonic composition of music for four voices (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass), and it is one of the shortest English madrigals, published in 1594.</p>



<p>After a first listen, this music seems to me like a Christmas carol, despite the fact that there is nothing in the lyrics that leads in that direction except the &#8220;cold December&#8221; section. Speaking of the lyrics, this is not a cheerful love poem, and I believe the music reflects the protagonist&#8217;s disappointment.</p>



<p>The song starts with gentle rhythms but ascending melodic lines when describing April and June as metaphors for her beauty and the warmth of her eyes.</p>



<p>But as the song progresses towards the colder months, it becomes a little melancholy and deeper, with the vocals becoming lower in pitch and dynamics. September has lengthier notes and the melodies are more similar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-1024x905.png" alt="" class="wp-image-456" width="320" height="282" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-1024x905.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-300x265.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-768x679.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-640x566.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-960x849.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33.png 1054w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></figure>



<p>The most memorable section of the music occurs in December when the tune of &#8220;But in her heart&#8221; is repeated several times by all voices. This is foreshadowing the protagonist&#8217;s disappointment when he discovers she is as cold as December, and all voices get quieter and slower.</p>



<p>For me, the most exciting part is when the voices interact, and you can hear one voice starting at one point and another voice following up where the first left. This example below exemplifies how Thomas Morley considered this, employing quavers to interact amongst the voices, crotchets, and minims when the melodies are independent. This results in a lovely soundscape.</p>

<p>Although it is polyphonic music with individual melodies, there is some round counterpoint, as shown in the examples above and below. This can demonstrate that the composer is not limited to a single style.</p>

<p>Because this is a 40-part motet, I did not follow the guideline of listening to it as many times as there are voices. </p>



<p>It was written about 1570 by Thomas Tallis for eight choirs of five voices each and is regarded as the greatest piece of English early music by certain commentators.</p>



<p>Writing polyphonic compositions is a complex job for the composer and a demanding one for the listener who tries to follow each melody alone. This is especially true for music with more than three or four melodies, so one can only imagine how impressive it is to write for 40 voices and over 11 minutes. An example of Tallis&#8217;s incredible work can be seen in the example below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="691" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-691x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-459" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-691x1024.png 691w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-202x300.png 202w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-768x1138.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-1037x1536.png 1037w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-300x445.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-640x948.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-960x1423.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52.png 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /></figure>



<p>Concentrating on individual melodies proved difficult in this situation, so I just listened to Spem in Alium as a whole choir song. I must add that it greatly surprised me and gave me a hypnotic sense due to the aural movements of the choirs. Though it is widely assumed that Tallis intended his choirs to be placed in a horseshoe form, I can only imagine how magnificent it would be to hear it live, with all eight choirs positioned in a circle around you, creating a 360º experience.</p>



<p>This piece, in my opinion, can be separated into three parts.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The first choir begins with just a few voices being formed together, then the other chorus joins them in turn. It almost sounds like a round.</li><li>Then, after a brief time when all 40 voices are singing together, we see an inverted movement from the opening section, in which the choirs follow each other in reverse order.</li><li>It is in the final section, which is more like a conversation between choirs, where this piece makes full use of its complexity, jumping between voices as it moves from choir to choir until it ends with all choirs singing together.</li></ul>



<p>Even though I didn&#8217;t find it boring, I thought the music was a bit longer than I would find interesting. Listening to it live would probably transmit the power and the spatial interactivity Tallis intended and keep it interesting for the whole 11 minutes of this piece.</p>



<h4 id="bach-prelude-and-fugue-no-17-in-ab-major-bwv-862">Bach: Prelude and Fugue No.17 in Ab major, BWV 862</h4>



<p>I was interested to listen how the polyphonic music developed from the renaissance era to the baroque. After reading some articles I found that Bach would be a great example of polyphonic baroque music, so I listened to a few of his fugues. The No.17 in Ab major was one the I liked most.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Richter plays Bach: WTC1 No. 17 in A flat major BWV 862" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gCL5Zvnt0TU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The polyphony of the late Baroque differed from that of the Renaissance: It was rooted in tonal harmony and characterized by an energetic, metrically conceived, driving rhythm (Hylton, 2005).</p>



<p>The start of the prelude really interested me because it was such a great way of opening a piece. It reminded me of some rock and heavy metal songs that start with triads in one guitar and a melody in another. </p>



<p>The theme of the prelude is repeated several times by both voices. Since polyphony can be hard to listen, this repetition of the main theme in one voice makes it sound familiar, while the other voice delivers a new and unexpected sound, making it fresh at the same time.</p>



<p>Even from the start is easy to find the differences from renaissance polyphony. More rhythm and more complexity. </p>



<p>Moving to the fugue, the new theme is clearly stated by repetition of the 4 voices, two in Ab major and two in Eb major.</p>



<p>I really like how the voices keep playing the main theme, specially when they rise for a perfect 4th or 5th as in the example below. It gives a really fresh and climatic tone to the music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="983" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-983x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-500" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-983x1024.png 983w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-288x300.png 288w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-768x800.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-1474x1536.png 1474w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-1965x2048.png 1965w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-300x313.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-640x667.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-960x1000.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2.png 2165w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></figure>



<p>Also interesting is that in bar 11 starts a new melody that is repeated by three voices, separating by a perfect 5th and a perfect 4th. This adds again a freshness to the music, and Bach makes sure that although this piece is polyphonic and complex, there is always a familiar tune to be listened.</p>

<p>I find this type of polyphony more interesting than the previous examples I listened, perhaps because I find that the complexity of notes and rhythms add more colour and interest to the piece.</p>



<h4 id="polyphony-of-dorze-people">Polyphony of Dorze People</h4>



<p>While researching polyphony, I came across this statement in the &#8216;Why do people sing?&#8217; book.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-solid-color"><blockquote><p>SubSaharan Africa is the largest and the most active region of distribution of vocal polyphony in the world.</p><cite>(Jordania, 2011)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Therefore, I decided to listen to some polyphony singing from the Dorze tribe in Ethiopia to see and understand the main differences between them and western polyphony.</p>

<p>There are two songs on this recording that I listened to:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Ritual song by young boys</li><li>Spinning song by young girls</li></ul>



<p>The first one had a drone-like effect in one of the voices while the other voices sang a repeated theme. It&#8217;s a pretty rhythmic tune, but it&#8217;s also incredibly repetitive, with the same theme running throughout.</p>



<p>The second song appears to be a three-part polyphony, with one high-pitched solo melody, another group melody, and a low-pitched rhythmical melody. This one appears to be more sophisticated than the last one and more enjoyable to listen to.</p>



<p>The biggest difference between this song and the ones I previously evaluated is that each voice is sung with a specific function in mind, such as a rhythmic voice or a harmonising voice.</p>



<h4 id="tautai-taora-ofrai-leeward-islands"><meta charset="utf-8">Tautai Taora Ofrai (Leeward Islands)</h4>



<p>Little did I know that Polynesia was one of the first places on earth to develop polyphonic music. Europeans discovered Polynesia&#8217;s long tradition of polyphonic music in the 18th century. This discovery was a shocking one for European musicians, who believed that polyphony, as an attribute of a more advanced musical civilization, could have been only a product of the Christian monastery (Jordania, 2011).</p>



<p>This is one of the examples of recorded Polynesian polyphony.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>I got the same feeling after listening to Tautai Taora Ofrai as I did after listening to Dorze People&#8217;s polyphony. It&#8217;s a song with a lot of rhythms, but it&#8217;s also very repetitive.</p>



<p>Apart from that, I found this music to have a structure, with three parts separated by a drone from one of the voices.</p>



<p>Another difference I noticed between the two listenings is that there are more voices (at least four different melodies) and that they don&#8217;t appear to have a specific role, but rather their own melodies that are distinct from the other voices.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Finally, I&#8217;d want to share one anti-polyphony viewpoint that startled me. As in the video below, polyphony was described by Vincenzo Galilei as &#8220;a big mess of incoherent imperfections&#8221;. Despite the fact that I believe these statements to be harsh, I can see why Vicenzo Galilei wrote them. Polyphony is difficult to listen to and, if not properly done, can quickly devolve into a big mess.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The goal of this project was to create three different melodic lines that combined to make a little polyphony. The same triad chord should be used to begin and end the song.</p>



<p>I started with three flutes, as one of the coursework examples suggested, but after experimenting with different melodies, I realized the three voices would sound too similar, so I switched to a woodwind trio of Flute, Oboe, and Bassoon.</p>



<p>This little polyphony was written in a different way from the rest of my projects. I composed vertically, which means I worked on all three melodies at the same time, one bar at a time. I began by deciding on a key (G minor), then came up with a chord progression that I liked: Gm &#8211; Eb – Bb &#8211; Gm. With these factors in mind, I began each bar with the triads of each chord and designed the melodies in each bar to connect the triads.</p>



<p>This way of work was interesting since I didn&#8217;t have a sense of a final melody while I worked, but when I got to the end, I could clearly hear the many melodies. I then made some adjustments to ensure that the voices don&#8217;t clash when played simultaneously, particularly with the 2nd and 7th intervals, which sound dissonant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In this project, I was tasked with writing a descant for three of the five tunes provided. My decision was determined after listening to the five songs and selecting the three that I liked the best.</p>



<p>After doing some reading on Descants, I tried to incorporate what I learnt into my exercises. I used counter motion, tried to employ thirds and sixths most of the time, and kept the descant rhythmically distinct from the main theme. In addition, I added the descant above the melody.</p>

<p>The main melody made me think that it could be played by the bassoon since in my research I found that the bassoon isn&#8217;t stuck to playing low notes, but can play high notes as well. It then occurred to me I&#8217;d seen a video of Debussy&#8217;s La fille aux cheveux de lin being performed by bassoon and harp. As a result, I wrote the descant for harp.</p>

<p>Even when the harp is played very quickly, it remains delicate and beautiful; therefore, I used quavers almost exclusively in contrast to the main melody crochets. In this piece, I used relatively little <meta charset="utf-8">contrary motion since I felt that the two instruments contrasted enough and sometimes they even completed each other, as you the example below.</p>

<p>I find the bassoon and oboe to be very celebratory instruments, as I explained before in my log. Because this tune sounded festive, I chose the oboe in contrast to the really high pitched piccolo. As I thought the piece needed some bass, I included the bass drum.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that both the descant and the main theme use quavers and semiquavers, I don&#8217;t think they clash, since I tried to respect the rhythm of each melody.</p>

<p>I chose this tune because I liked it, but I also knew it beforehand, so I tried to have fun. As the music always sounded like a church sound, I decided to go with the organ for the main theme and the choir to sing the descant.</p>



<p>For this exercise, I focused on the rhythmic differences of each tune, except for the finale, which I wanted to be memorable. Because of that, they both have the same rhythm, but they move in opposite directions.</p>

<p>With the descant, I had considerably more fun than I did with the rounds. The main difference is that melody is more about improvisation and novelty, opposite to the more structured thought processes of a round. However, I find that both methods help me get a better sense of vertical composition.</p>

<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Descant is a form of counterpoint, but usually is introduced after the melody is established and sang above the melody</li><li>Descants usually are written in the 3rd and 6th notes of the notes played by the melody</li><li>Although is not used in modern music, I believe it did not disappeared, just evolved</li></ul>



<p>My first step was to look up the definition of Descants. Merriam-Webster defines it as &#8220;a superimposed counterpoint to a simple melody sung typically by some or all of the sopranos&#8221;.</p>



<p>One of the definitions in The Oxford Dictionary of Music is &#8220;In modern hymn singing, a freely written or improvised soprano part added to a hymn tune while the tune itself is sung by the rest of the choir or by the congregation.&#8221; (Kennedy, Kennedy and Rutherford-Johnson, 2012).</p>



<p>In my own words, it occurs when composers introduce a melody over an already established tune and both perform flawlessly.</p>



<p>But one question arose: what is the difference between counterpoint and descant, given that both are melodies over melodies?</p>



<p>I struggled to find an answer to my question, but after some thought, I believe a descant is a type of counterpoint. However, there are two significant differences between regular and descant counterpoints:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>A descant is introduced&nbsp;when the melody has been well established, either via repetition or by being a popular melody, whereas conventional counterpoint can be used at any time. As a result, descants are frequently introduced near the end of a hymn, as as in ‘Hark! the Herald Angels Sing,&#8217; as shown below.</li><li>A descant is a melody that is placed above the melody by high-pitched singers or instruments (What is a… Descant?, 2021). A normal counterpoint can be placed either above or below the melody.</li></ul>



<p>The majority of the examples I discovered were from choral works. As a result, my listening will be primarily focused on two of these works.</p>

<p>The descant is only introduced in minute 2:16 of this Christmas carol, proving my claim that descants are introduced after the main melody is well established. One of the most fascinating aspects of the descant is illustrated in the image below. Both melodies have a contrary motion, so when one goes up, the other goes down. When they appear to clash (in the &#8220;of&#8221; passage), the descant descends to its lowest note, while the main melody ascends to its highest tone. This, together with the use of thirds and sixths, makes a nice contrast.</p>

<p>The descant appears at the end of the song, at the 2:46 mark. And with this song, I discovered another reason to create a descant: it can give the music an apotheotic ending, as I demonstrate below. Look at how the main melody is largely made up of crochets and only utilizes 5 notes, whereas the descant melody is mostly made up of quavers and uses 8 different notes in a descending &#8211; descending &#8211; ascending form. This gives the song a powerful ending.</p>

<p>Later, I came across this video in which one individual I couldn&#8217;t name, claims that the descant was a noble kind of art that is now extinct.</p>

<p>I would argue that if the descant is defined by an improvised line spoken over a known tune, it is not lost but rather moved from the vocal to the guitar. Guitar solos, in my opinion, are the modern equivalent of descant. I understand that this may offend some purist music theorists, but if you think of music as an evolving form of art, it makes sense.</p>



<p>Consider the Merriam-Webster definition (a superimposed counterpoint to a simple melody sung typically by some or all of the sopranos) and consider the guitar solo as a superimposed counterpoint over a simple melody, usually played by higher-pitched sounds and usually introduced after the main melody is established.</p>



<p>There are a million examples of guitar solos, improvised or not, over a melody, but I think the 1950s blues, when the electric guitar became popular, is one fantastic example of how the vocal descant transferred to the guitar solo, or should I say guitar descant.</p>

<p>For this project, I had to write 4 perpetual rounds using the given triad progression as a starting point.</p>



<p>I began by looking at what are the guidelines for writing a perpetual round in order to prepare for this Rounds exercise. <a href="http://www.donaldsonworkshop.com/journal/Poesy/music/round/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.donaldsonworkshop.com/journal/Poesy/music/round/" target="_blank">This</a> and <a href="http://blog.mymusictheory.com/2014/how-to-compose-a-canon-or-round-easy-composition/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://blog.mymusictheory.com/2014/how-to-compose-a-canon-or-round-easy-composition/" target="_blank">this</a> website gave me some insight.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Specify how many bars you want before a second voice enters</li><li>Write a chord progression that spans that many bars. (I was given these in this project.)</li><li>Your melody line should be composed of notes from that chord progression, repeating it as many times as you want voices to appear in your round.</li><li>Include notes that were not in the chords, in order to make the melody more interesting.</li></ul>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>



<p>I didn&#8217;t particularly enjoy composing rounds, but I acknowledge that this project supported my learning since I can plainly see how this unit progresses from a single melody to counterpoint and harmony. The method I composed rounds was to make sure that all voices had chord notes in the beat. I tried to use notes from the scale in between beats to ensure that no notes collided in between voices. I didn&#8217;t include any instruments in my scores because my intention was to keep the rounds basic while still allowing for as many timbres as feasible.</p>

<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Use sounds other than traticional acoustic instruments to convey an atmosphere</li><li>Keep the melody interesting by beginning notes just before or after they should begin</li><li>Surprise the audience with key changes</li></ul>



<p>For me, Stevie Wonder is an acquired taste. I didn&#8217;t love his music as much when I was younger, but as I&#8217;ve gotten older, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate and admire how he created such beautiful songs.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that his album Songs In The Key Of Life is widely regarded as his masterpiece, one of his songs that I particularly enjoy listening to is Overjoyed. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot of literature devoted to describing how Stevie Wonder composed his songs, but I wanted to understand for myself why I appreciate this song so much and what composing talents he used to achieve such a wonderful sound.</p>



<p>Previous note: I will not study the lyrics because I am more interested in melody, harmony, and rhythm at the moment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Stevie Wonder - Overjoyed ((Live in Japan))" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11kOx3xcX-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The song begins with a piano and guitar accompanied by strange sounds. Stevie Wonder refers to it as Environmental Percussion, and it consists of natural noises such as birds, crushed leaves, and stones dropped in a pond (Harrington, 1985). In fact, these water drops can be found throughout the song in the backbeat.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell which key the music starts in since it goes from C# Major 6 to C7 to B Major 7 and then back to C7. It repeats once again, but instead of going up in the last chord, it goes down to Bb.</p>



<p>This intro is such an odd way to begin a song because it doesn&#8217;t really inform you what to anticipate. When the line is descending, the listener expects it to continue descending, but the chords rise, and when it repeats, the expectation is that it will rise in the last chord, but it continues to descend. This up and down uncertainty, as well as the sounds of nature, distinguishes this song from many others.</p>



<p>When the verse begins, the chords and voice shift to Eb, the song&#8217;s key. The final Bb chord of the intro now makes sense because it is the dominant of the Eb.</p>



<p>The verse is an I-vi-ii-V progression, which is quite common, and the vocal melody is also quite simple. With such an odd beginning, you wouldn&#8217;t expect such a straightforward but wonderful verse.</p>



<p>One thing I realized is that if you listen closely to Steve&#8217;s vocal melody, he begins slightly before the rhythm, as shown in the example below. This syncopation is a subtle but crucial rhythm decision in my opinion. It appears that the singer is propelling the music ahead with vowels rather than consonants, as one might expect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="120" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1024x120.png" alt="" class="wp-image-402" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1024x120.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-300x35.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-768x90.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1536x180.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-2048x239.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-640x75.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-960x112.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When there is a repetition, Stevie Wonder goes to unexpected places, as he did in the intro. When the listener expects an ii (F minor) in the I-vi-ii-V progression in the second part of the verse, the music modulates to a C major scale, and the chords go to an F major 7 and then to a G major 7, and the B part of the verse begins in C major.</p>



<p>This game of not giving the listener what he expects is not new, but it works marvellously when it is effectively crafted.</p>



<p>When the listener expects a repetition in this B section of the verse, the music moves to another area. In this case, we expect to stay in the major key, but the third chord is a C minor, so the key shifts to a minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="441" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1024x441.png" alt="" class="wp-image-403" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1024x441.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-300x129.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-768x331.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1536x661.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-2048x882.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-640x276.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-960x413.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Following the verse, the melody gracefully transitions to the chorus, with a chromatic rise to a new chord: Ab Major. The melody drops through G &#8211; F &#8211; Eb &#8211; D, which is on the Eb major scale, so I don&#8217;t believe the music modulates to a new key signature.</p>



<p>This chorus is particularly fascinating since the chords he uses to advance to the chorus are also used to decrease in the chorus. That&#8217;s intriguing because Stevie Wonder, once again, plays with the listener&#8217;s expectations. He went up with Bb &#8211; C -D &#8211; Eb &#8211; F -G then down with G &#8211; F &#8211; Eb &#8211; D, therefore the following note should be C, but instead, he changes the chorus to C#. It&#8217;s only for a moment, but it&#8217;s a pleasant surprise. But the surprise doesn&#8217;t stop there; the chorus modulates to a new key a whole tone above, creating a fantastic climax.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="603" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1024x603.png" alt="" class="wp-image-406" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1024x603.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-300x177.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-768x453.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1536x905.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-2048x1207.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-640x377.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-960x566.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The song returns to the intro and the verse, but when the music moves to the chorus again, the melody begins in the A (just as it did in the second chorus). At this point, the listener may wonder if the chorus can get any higher. It does. Again, we modulate to a whole tone above, reaching the peak of the song.</p>



<p>As expected, the song culminates with the root note Eb after the chorus. There are no surprises at the end of the song.</p>



<p>I knew this song was beautifully crafted even before I analyzed it, but I had no idea it had so many details like the water sound, the syncopation in the verse, or the major/minor key modulations. I genuinely believe that this analysis helped me understand how to keep a song engaging without making it appear overly difficult.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A round is a musical composition in the form of a canon, and the melody is constructed in a way that produces a counterpoint when various performers or instruments begin it at different times. It is known as a &#8220;perpetual canon&#8221; since its ending works along with the opening.</p>



<p>I listened to dozens of rounds because they are typically easy and fun to listen to. I chose a few that appealed to me the most.</p>



<h3 id="the-great-bells-of-oseney">The Great Bells of Oseney</h3>



<p>This is a three-part round from 1609, but I couldn&#8217;t discover any further information about it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/deut9.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This is a pretty simple round, but it&#8217;s useful to understand how three voices are used to produce triads most of the time, particularly in the first and end beats.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="351" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-1024x351.png" alt="" class="wp-image-381" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-1024x351.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-300x103.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-768x264.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-1536x527.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-640x220.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells-960x330.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/great-bells.png 1684w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>A three-part round in Hebrew from the 15th century that is frequently assigned to Johannes Ockeghem, despite the lack of strong evidence of that.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/havanashira.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The intriguing aspect of this round is that all voices have the identical note durations in the first two bars, resulting in a tremendous harmonizing sound. This pattern is disrupted in the third and fourth bars by the introduction of quavers, which creates a nice surprise.</p>

<p>A three-part round in the minor key that dates back to at least 1609.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/heyhonobody.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Typically, rounds are amusing or joyous songs, but this one is a lament sung in the D Minor scale. In contrast to the other rounds, this one employs a lot of quavers in between the chords, resulting in a more nuanced music. Another intriguing element is that the melody ends in the supertonic rather than the tonic, producing a sense of incompleteness and perpetualness.</p>

<p>This is a popular Latin three-part round that is frequently assigned to Palestrina, however some contend that it was written by Mozart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/donanobis.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>What strikes me the most about this round is that, except the first two bars, all voices are really close together. They even end all three on the same note. When sang collectively, I believe this produces a more powerful sound, but I don&#8217;t believe the listener can follow the voices independently, which is one of the most interesting things in rounds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSCeV7WH2ms">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSCeV7WH2ms</a></p>



<p>This is a quick four-part round from 1609.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/joanglover.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>What I found remarkable about this round is the rhythm that all four voices repeat, almost always employing the triad. I think it&#8217;s incredibly danceable, and when sung in a group, it may make for a very energetic round.</p>

<p>This famous round is in A major for four voices by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.</p>

<p>I was curious to hear a Mozart round, and I loved how he employed the Minims and crochets to keep the bass notes sustained. When listening to the melody with just one voice, it&#8217;s difficult to tell if there&#8217;s a top melody and a bass background, but when all voices are heard combined, it&#8217;s clear that there is.</p>

<p>Of course, I couldn&#8217;t leave Henry Purcell out of this round (pun intended).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D3TGowLoiPY/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>My favorite Purcell round was this one, which was humourous in style and delightful in how the voices sang &#8220;so kiss my arse&#8221; properly, accentuating each note with great force and confidence.</p>

<p>Although the majority of the examples I listened to were made more than a century ago, I remembered two instances from recent music that demonstrate that rounds are alive and well and may be employed in a modern context.</p>



<p>The most well-known is the final section of The Beach Boys&#8217; &#8211; God only knows. I recently watched Paul Mccartney&#8217;s documentary &#8220;McCartney 3, 2, 1,&#8221; in which he admits that Brian Wilson is one of his favorite harmony composers, and you can tell that this round is quite well composed.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Another song from the musical Rent that came to mind is &#8220;Will I?&#8221; from the musical Rent. Musicals, in my opinion, are a terrific platform for writing rounds because you can work with different vocal tones, portrayed by different characters, and so create a highly dynamic song.</p>

		<span>From what I knew just three months ago, I&#8217;m seeing remarkable development.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it if someone told me a few months ago that I&#8217;d be composing and notating a 2-minute solo piece. Three months ago, I was having difficulty reading music scores, using software like Sibelius, and understanding some musical concepts.   My tutor told me that it was normal and that I should expect a learning curve, but I had not anticipated making such rapid progress in such a short period of time.</p>



<p>I learned a lot about scales and, in particular, how melodies are made. I had a lot of fun analyzing everything from simple ancient melodies to more complicated and contemporary ones, which helped me with my Assignment 2 composition.</p>

<h3 id="about-assignment-2">About Assignment 2</h3>



<p>The assignment took far longer than I thought once again. According to the OCA assignment introduction, this should take about 3 hours, yet it took me about 3 days. Despite the amount of time it took me, I am quite pleased with the outcome. I was able to incorporate my idea for this work into the score, generating two contrasting parts for the two clarinet registers &#8211; chalumeau and clarion.</p>



<p>The four basic elements of music are rhythm, melody, harmony, and tone colour (Copland, Rich and Slatkin, 2011). Because this section of the course is about melody, I concentrated on the melodic rather than the rhythmic aspects of the piece. I wanted at least one memorable section of the tune that the listener would recognize immediately when it was repeated. With the main motif, I believe I was successful.</p>



<p>Although I liked creating for untuned percussion, I must say that composing for a pitched instrument was far more enjoyable. However, I must admit that the rhythm aspect was crucial, particularly in terms of not being stuck with a time signature or employing pauses as rhythmic alterations.</p>



<p>On the downside, I believe I could improve some aspects of my composition. I think the music sometimes goes to predictable places rather than surprising the listener with unexpected notes. In the next assignment, I must avoid this. I also believe I rushed several parts of the composition when the music needed to rest. Due to the 2-minute time limit, this was necessary.</p>



<p>Overall, I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing what my tutor thinks of this work and any ideas and adjustments he or she may have.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As part of the second assignment, I had to write a composition for a solo woodwind instrument that lasted between 1:30 and 2 minutes. The challenge of this composition is that I can use whichever scale I choose (it can be more than one scale), to take advantage of the instrument&#8217;s specific features and to respect its range.</p>



<p>You can find the final score <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=119PoSR35LbSVWA-Gnx6kXQBo5EyIMBrI" data-type="URL" data-id="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=119PoSR35LbSVWA-Gnx6kXQBo5EyIMBrI" target="_blank">here</a> and listen to it below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Assignment-2.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>Just like in the first assignment, I thought it was beneficial to create an outline and get an idea of what I was trying to accomplish beforehand. Though it may seem counterproductive at first, the structure and the idea helped me stay focused and keep a coherent thought process.</p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1631516667878 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Idea / Theme</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>This piece will centre around a character that is mournful during the workweek and eccentric on the weekend. In a routine and boring job, weekdays become monotonous and boring, while weekends become exciting and fun.</p>



<p>Usually on Mondays you feel melancholy, Tuesday through Thursday are monotonous and regretful, followed by Friday and Saturday with euphoria, and finally Sunday turns slowly into melancholy again and you&#8217;re back on Monday.</p>



<h2 id="the-structure" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1631516674208 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Structure</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>As soon as I had the idea, the structure made sense to me. First, there is an intro, followed by the main theme, and then there is a happy section. Revert to the main motif before ending the same way it began.</p>



<p>For the first two parts, the tempo would be slow, followed by a fast tempo for the third part, and then slowly decreasing for the final two parts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular cnvs-block-core-table-1628498574118"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The week starts slowly and melancholic</td><td>A</td><td><meta charset="utf-8">~40 seconds at ~50 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>The rest of the week is mournful</td><td>B</td><td><meta charset="utf-8">~40 seconds at <meta charset="utf-8">~50 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>It&#8217;s the weekend!

<h2 id="the-motifs" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1631516680946 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Motifs</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>My process for composing a motif was to play simple lines on the piano and to find one that sounds right to me. Inspiration overcame transpiration in this case. After some time, I began playing these four notes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="360" height="208" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.13.05.png" alt="" class="wp-image-350" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.13.05.png 360w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.13.05-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></figure>



<p>In spite of the simplicity of the melody, I liked the quaver/crochet rhythm, which gave me a sense of lull and monotony that I felt was appropriate for the B part. Although it feels like it is going up, it lacks the strength to stay up and goes down. Likewise, our character longs for the energy to accomplish something but returns to mourning.</p>



<p>After that, I discovered that the scale I wanted to work on would be the E harmonic minor, with the seventh diminished, which sounds exotic but at the same time lamenting.</p>



<p>The A part of the song has a similar motif to the B part, but to me, it feels more nostalgic, like someone is remembering the good old days (like the weekend).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="410" height="236" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.12.33.png" alt="" class="wp-image-351" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.12.33.png 410w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.12.33-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></figure>



<p>Because the C part is festive, I knew right away that I needed to change the scale, but not by much because the character remains the same and I didn&#8217;t want to have a big contrast. I chose to use the Ukrainian minor scale in the key of C, which is one of the most widely used scales in Klezmer music. As I worked with this scale, I realized these are exactly the notes of the G harmonic minor scale. I found this scale very festive even though it is a minor scale, which goes against the common idea that minor scales are sad.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="250" height="186" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.14.47.png" alt="" class="wp-image-352"/></figure>



<p>In the C part of the song, the motif is made up of quavers and semiquavers, enjoying the wonderful staccato the clarinet can produce.</p>



<h2 id="the-clarinet" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1631516687676 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Clarinet</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The clarinet is extremely versatile, and that&#8217;s why I chose it. With this piece, I wanted to push myself to explore both low and high registers while maintaining a cohesive line throughout. Clarinets have the broadest range of all woodwinds and can easily transition from <em>pianissimo</em> to <em>fortissimo</em> (Adler, 2002).</p>



<p>My research on the clarinet led me to these videos from Josh Plotner which explain, among other things, that the composer should avoid the Throat Tones register (from G4 to Bb4) due to its hollowness and weak sound. Although I tried to avoid these notes, it was difficult for me to eliminate them from the melody.</p>



<p>In the videos, it is also explained to avoid flutter tongue and use growl instead, since it sounds better.</p>

<p>It is also advised to avoid the transition between B4 and Bb4, referred to as &#8220;the break,&#8221; due to its difficult transition that only experienced players can handle (Adler, 2002).</p>

		<span>The Composition</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p><strong>Part A</strong> Bars 1-9</p>



<p>This section serves as a brief introduction and presents the first motif. The purpose of this section is to show the listener that the melody will stay in the Chalumeau register.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 1-4 are slow notes establishing the scale</li><li>Bars 5-9 are the part A motif followed by a descending to end this part</li></ul>



<p><strong>Part B</strong> Bars 10-19</p>



<p>While the tempo remains the same, the time signature switches to 3/4 here, and the dynamics increase. As a result, the listener can feel the character&#8217;s discomfort and lament.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 10-11 the main motif is presented and raised by one step</li><li>Bars 12-13 a variation of the motif going down and ending in the 5th</li><li>Bar 14 is a variation of the main motif</li><li>Bar 15 is a repetition of bar 11</li><li>Bar 16 is similar to bar 11 but with the extra QUAVER</li><li>Bars 17-19 the melody descends ending with a trill to the tonic</li></ul>



<p><strong>Part C</strong> Bars 20-43</p>



<p>In contrast to the previous two, this is the fastest section. Here, glissandos and growls are used to convey the feel of the parties and the exuberance of the weekend concept.</p>

<p>I do not intend to conduct in-depth analyses of these solo compositions, but rather to concentrate on how the composers wrote for that unique instrument. What techniques they employed, and how they attained various tonalities and colours in relation to each instrument.</p>



<h2 id="flute">Flute</h2>



<h5 id="claude-debussy-syrinx">Claude Debussy &#8211; Syrinx</h5>



<p>Due to the fact that it is likely the first flute solo piece written since the baroque period, Syrinx is one of the most important pieces written for flute solo. More composers were motivated to create for the unaccompanied flute as a result of this (Lee, 2018).</p>



<p>This composition, as well as the growing interest in the flute as a solo instrument, is thought to be attributable to advancements in the instrument, which allowed for new methods and sound colour. Indeed, Debussy explores the flute&#8217;s various tonalities and ranges. Consider the motif in the first bar, which is played in a high range with <em>mezzo-forte</em>.</p>

<p>The same motif is repeated, but in a lower range and <em>piano</em>, giving the piece a darker feel.</p>

<p>Debussy uses the flute&#8217;s many ranges, travelling from C4 to E6 with multiple wave-like movements, creating a hypnotic sound.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="209" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-1024x209.png" alt="" class="wp-image-336" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-1024x209.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-300x61.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-768x156.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-1536x313.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-640x130.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-960x196.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32.png 1590w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s fascinating to hear Debussy move from the piece&#8217;s climax to its conclusion using an almost all direct descending line in the final section of Syrinx. At the same time, he goes from a <em>mezzo-forte</em> to a <em>piano</em>. This demonstrates how the flute may go from a loud and detailed high note, suited for demisemiquavers, to a very low register that is calmer, darker, and more sustained.</p>

<h2 id="oboe">Oboe</h2>



<h5 id="gordon-jacob-seven-bagatelles">Gordon Jacob &#8211; Seven Bagatelles</h5>



<p>Gordon Jacob composed seven short solo oboe compositions. The works are all fairly different, demonstrating the oboe&#8217;s tonal versatility as a solo instrument.</p>



<p>The oboe&#8217;s ability to play a mixture of legato and staccato phrases in a light bouncy style, like in 5 &#8211; Limerick, is one example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="958" height="324" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54.png" alt="" class="wp-image-337" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54.png 958w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54-300x101.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54-768x260.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54-640x216.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></figure>



<p>In 4 &#8211; Slow Air, Jacob also explores the prolonged notes as well as the various dynamics that sound lethargic or sorrowful.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="816" height="366" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.44.34.png" alt="" class="wp-image-338" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.44.34.png 816w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.44.34-300x135.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.44.34-768x344.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.44.34-640x287.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /></figure>



<p>The 2 &#8211; Elegy explores the melody lines that fit the oboe so well, as well as the big intervals that provide a wonderful contrast, especially in the high registers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="158" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-1024x158.png" alt="" class="wp-image-339" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-1024x158.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-300x46.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-768x118.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-1536x236.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-640x99.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-960x148.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-1920x298.png 1920w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36.png 1936w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The oboe&#8217;s melodic quality is also evident in the 6 &#8211; Chinese Tune, which employs the pentatonic scale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="736" height="284" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.42.35.png" alt="" class="wp-image-340" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.42.35.png 736w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.42.35-300x116.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.42.35-640x247.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></figure>



<p>The potential of the oboe to handle rather large leaps (Adler, 2002) is explored in various pieces, with the 3 &#8211; Waltz being one of them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="556" height="274" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.45.34.png" alt="" class="wp-image-341" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.45.34.png 556w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.45.34-300x148.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></figure>



<h2 id="saxophone">Saxophone</h2>



<h5 id="paul-creston-sonata-for-alto-saxophone-and-piano-op-19">Paul Creston &#8211; Sonata for Alto Saxophone and Piano, Op. 19</h5>



<p>I looked for a version of the saxophone solo as suggested, but all I found was the sonata accompanied by the piano. I&#8217;m not sure if this is the only version of the sonata available.</p>



<p>Before researching for this piece, I had never heard of Paul Creston, and I was pleased to learn that he was glad to create for often-overlooked instruments (Watanabe, 2011). Indeed, there were not many works dedicated to the saxophone in the 1930s, when this sonata was written (Mauk, 2015), therefore I was intrigued to learn what specific aspects he wrote for this instrument.</p>



<p>This work is structured into three movements, each of which is different. He begins with a jazzy opening, then transitions to a slower second movement before concluding with a more rhythmic movement. This demonstrates a saxophone&#8217;s adaptability, which I thought noteworthy.</p>



<p>One thing I observed in the first movement is the tempo shifts, which go from a fast <meta charset="utf-8">♩=126 “With vigor” to a calming in bar 10 and then a rise in bar 17. These changes are ideal for the saxophone, which can gracefully handle both slow and quick shifts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="124" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-11.45.59-1024x124.png" alt="" class="wp-image-362" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-11.45.59-1024x124.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-11.45.59-300x36.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-11.45.59-768x93.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-11.45.59-640x78.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-11.45.59-960x116.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-11.45.59.png 1486w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>The dynamics of the saxophone in this tune are one of the most noticeable variances. It has a wide range of dynamics, similar to the clarinet, and in this composition, it ranges from pianissimo to fortissimo. However, in contrast to the clarinet, I found the pianissimo not so soft and the fortissimo a little to bright. I&#8217;m curious how these dynamic shifts would function in a woodwind ensemble.</p>



<p>The second movement is a little more serene, with long notes that are representative of what one would expect from a saxophone. This movement surprised me least despite being extremely melodic and almost singable.</p>



<p>The third movement, on the other hand, surprised me the most, especially because I wasn&#8217;t expecting to hear the saxophone play such a rhythmic role. The saxophone sounds incredibly expressive and almost danceable in this passage, from the main theme to the staccato followed by the marcato.</p>

<h2 id="bassoon">Bassoon</h2>



<h5 id="willson-osborne-rhapsody-for-bassoon">Willson Osborne &#8211; Rhapsody for Bassoon</h5>



<p>Just one thing to mention: the C.F. Peters Corp edition of this score has beautiful lettering.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FTWQ30DqL.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="402"/></figure>



<p>My previous perception of the bassoon was that it is a very melancholy instrument. Wilson Osborne did not mislead me.</p>



<p>Slow parts are no problem for the bassoon, but what amazed me the most was how beautifully the quick runs worked. Osborne was able to arrange it in a very melodious manner, demonstrating the bassoon&#8217;s versatility.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="517" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-1024x517.png" alt="" class="wp-image-368" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-1024x517.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-300x152.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-768x388.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-1536x776.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-2048x1034.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-640x323.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-960x485.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17.png 2356w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The bassoon is a fantastic solo instrument in all registers, but when it&#8217;s accompanied, it gets swallowed up by the other instruments (Adler, 2002). That&#8217;s why Osborne presumably didn&#8217;t stick to the bassoon&#8217;s lower registers, opting instead to use the higher register, which is thin yet expressive.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="311" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-1024x311.png" alt="" class="wp-image-369" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-1024x311.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-300x91.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-768x233.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-1536x466.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-640x194.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-960x291.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53.png 1582w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Because the bassoon can&#8217;t handle forceful blows, it&#8217;s not surprising that Osborne didn&#8217;t go over <em>forte</em> in terms of dynamics.</p>



<p>The relative lack of rests was the last thing I noticed that I wasn&#8217;t anticipating. The bassoonist, in my opinion, would benefit from more breathing time and lengthier breaks. But I don&#8217;t believe Osborne agreed.</p>



<h2 id="clarinet"><meta charset="utf-8">Clarinet</h2>



<p>In my second assignment and Alan Hovhaness&#8217;s analysis, I do further research on the clarinet.</p>

		<span>What makes a happy melody?</span>

</h2>



<p>I was listening to music on Spotify on shuffle when Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro came on, and I had a thought: why do I feel happy every time I hear this song, particularly the chorus? I&#8217;ll try to figure it out by examining its melody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Tim Maia - Não Quero Dinheiro(Só quero amar) in Enlgish &amp; PT-BR" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOlLs6D7BpU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption>Dailybrasilinfo, 2017. <em>Tim Maia &#8211; Não Quero Dinheiro(Só quero amar) in Enlgish &amp; PT-BR</em>.  Available at: &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOlLs6D7BpU> [Accessed 6 September 2021].</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tim Maia was a Brazilian musician who is regarded as one of the country&#8217;s most influential musicians. Maia pioneered sambalanço with Jorge Ben, a genre that combines samba, soul, funk, and rock and roll.</p>



<p>In 1971, he recorded Não Quero Dinheiro, a samba/soul song in which he declares, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any money, I just want love,&#8221; in response to rising consumerism. It&#8217;s a love song that&#8217;s likely influenced by the peace and love movement of the 1960s. The song went on to become a great success. Note that Brazil was under a dictatorship at the time, and this style of music was used as an escape from oppression.</p>



<p>This song catches my attention because of its general cheerfulness and happiness just by listening to it. This is, in my opinion, to do with repetition, syncopation, and tension.</p>



<p>The song begins with a syncopated melody that is repeated twice before the variation. This is the song&#8217;s verse, and while the tone is lively, it does not reach the climax of the chorus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="247" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-1024x247.png" alt="" class="wp-image-327" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-1024x247.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-300x72.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-768x185.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-1536x370.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-640x154.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-960x231.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10.png 1610w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>First verse of Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro</figcaption></figure>



<p>The chorus is the most joyful element of the song, but Tim Maia&#8217;s creation of a hymn with only three notes is even more astounding. And I believe that repetition is the key. In the first part of the chorus, the A is repeated 32 times.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="238" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1024x238.png" alt="" class="wp-image-328" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1024x238.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-768x178.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1536x357.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-2048x476.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-640x149.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-960x223.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001.png 2187w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>First part of the chorus of <meta charset="utf-8">Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you listen to this melody alone, especially on the piano, you&#8217;ll hear almost a childlike repetition. As if a child was trying to prove she was better than others. It seems like you might be able to sing &#8220;My toy is better than yours&#8221; in this melody.</p>



<p>This chorus is also characterized by tension. The song repeats itself six times, creating tension, with the hope of resolution which comes in half of the seventh bar. The repetition-tension-resolution game continues throughout the entire melody.</p>



<p>I was delighted to discover this Ted Talk about music repetition by Elizabeth Margulis, Professor and Director of Princeton University&#8217;s Music Cognition Lab.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, repetition makes you feel that music is more enjoyable, more interesting and more human. Music critics, according to Margulis, are often embarrassed by repetition, believing it to be childish or regressive; but repetition, far from being embarrassing, helps us to think of music as a way of seeing the world.</p>



<p>Not to be forgotten is Beethoven&#8217;s repeated four-note theme in his Symphony No. 5 or Ravel&#8217;s Bolero, which is composed entirely of variations on a single motif.</p>



<p>Finally, in my opinion, what makes this melody feel happy and cheery is the same childish repetition that reminds you of a period when life was simple and happy, and all you cared about was playing and being happy. And those joyful memories are made up of repeated memories.</p>

		<span>I&#8217;ve learned that I&#8217;ve always liked counterpoint.</span>

</h2>



<p>My tutor encouraged me to add research in my log on terminology that I wasn&#8217;t familiar with. So I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;d heard of counterpoint before, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what it meant. Therefore I decided to research it and in the process, I realized I began playing music due to the counterpoint.</p>



<p>To begin with, the basic definition of counterpoint is when at least two melodies are layered one on top of the other (Wood, 1932). Bach&#8217;s two-part Inventions (Taylor, 2012) are an example of such counterpoint:</p>

<p>Although there are many examples of counterpoint, canons, and fugues in classical music, I was curious if it was applied in recent popular music.</p>



<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers were one of my favorite bands growing up, mainly because of Flea&#8217;s bass lines. That is why I decided to learn to play the bass. That was counterpoint working on rock music, I had no idea. And counterpoint was the reason I was so captivated with that band.</p>

<p>Queen was another band I grew up admiring, and Freddy Mercury and Brian May were masters of counterpoint. In this Killer Queen example, notice how the guitar and backup vocals occasionally play their own melodies:</p>

<p>I looked into other examples and realized that, while not being a band I normally listen to, Radiohead used a lot of counterpoints in their music, which made me enjoy them far more. For example, just listening to the melody of the trombone in their song Life In A Glasshouse is lovely.</p>

<p>And, since it&#8217;s Friday, here&#8217;s one more example of how the guitar, in addition to the vocal melody and band harmony, plays its own melody. The guitar is isolated in this example because I believe it is simpler to understand the melody of the guitar, and anyone who knows the song can place the voice melody on top without listening to it.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that my reflection on the counterpoint in this piece is superficial, and that thousands of pages have been written about it, but it has helped me to better comprehend the concept and develop it in my future work.</p>

<p>The goal of this project was to write nine woodwind pieces in nine distinct scales.</p>



<h5 id="1-whole-tone-scale">1 &#8211; Whole tone scale</h5>



<p>This scale appealed to me as mysterious and incomplete, which is why I abruptly ended this melody. Because the flute gives a light, airy, bright, and rich sound that matches this song, I used it in the middle register.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="456" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-1024x456.png" alt="" class="wp-image-296" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-1024x456.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-300x134.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-768x342.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-1536x684.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2048x912.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-640x285.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-960x428.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001.png 2077w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="2-whole-tone-scale">2 &#8211; Whole-tone scale</h5>



<p>This is another melody I&#8217;ve kept incomplete because I get the feeling of doubt when hearing the whole-tone scale. I picked up the alto saxophone for this exercise mostly out of curiosity. If used softly in the lower register, it can transmit a melancholic sound, but when played faster and in the upper register, it can sound hard and clear.</p>

<h5 id="3-east-european-major-scale">3 &#8211; East European major scale</h5>



<p>With significant leaps (3 semitones) between the 2nd and 3rd, and the 6th and 7th, this scale in major sounds quite celebratory. The bassoon, especially with the staccato, is perfectly suited for humorous sound. That&#8217;s why I tried to include it into the melody&#8217;s opening section.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="356" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1024x356.png" alt="" class="wp-image-301" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1024x356.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-300x104.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-768x267.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1536x534.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-2048x711.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-640x222.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-960x333.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2.png 2116w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="4-east-european-minor-scale">4 &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">East European minor scale</h5>



<p>This scale, on the other hand, has a sorrowful and melancholy tone to it. I avoided choosing instruments that could communicate grief, such as the clarinet, and instead focused on the flute&#8217;s middle and low registers.</p>

<h5 id="5-middle-eastern-eight-note-scale">5 &#8211; Middle Eastern eight-note scale</h5>



<p>Due to the presence of numerous semitones, this scale sounded quite mysterious. Because of its dark timbre, I chose the contrabassoon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="207" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-1024x207.png" alt="" class="wp-image-306" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-1024x207.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-300x61.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-768x155.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-1536x310.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-2048x414.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-640x129.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-960x194.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006.png 2147w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7-7.mp3"></audio></figure>



<h5 id="6-middle-eastern-eight-note-scale">6 &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">Middle Eastern eight-note scale</h5>



<p>This song maintains the mystery nature of the scale, but I attempted to give it a more Middle Eastern flavor. In its middle range, the oboe was ideal for what I was seeking for.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="203" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-1024x203.png" alt="" class="wp-image-308" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-1024x203.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-300x60.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-768x152.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-1536x305.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-2048x406.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-640x127.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-960x191.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003.png 2101w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="7-nine-note-scale">7 &#8211; Nine-note scale</h5>



<p>The extra notes in this scale were used to create ornaments that are perfect for the piccolo. I ended up writing a pretty cheerful melody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="381" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-1024x381.png" alt="" class="wp-image-310" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-1024x381.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-300x111.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-768x285.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-1536x571.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-2048x761.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-640x238.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-960x357.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007.png 2123w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="8-nine-note-scale">8 &#8211; Nine-note scale</h5>



<p>The extra notes also were used as ornaments for the clarinet&#8217;s fast sections in this melody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="377" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-1024x377.png" alt="" class="wp-image-312" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-1024x377.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-300x111.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-768x283.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-1536x566.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-2048x755.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-640x236.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-960x354.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008.png 2084w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h5 id="9-chromatic-scale">9 &#8211; Chromatic scale</h5>



<p>Among all the scales I wrote, this one was probably the most fun, since I got to play with the rising and descending of the scale in the first part and then utilize it to show off the lower register of the clarinet in the second part.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To compose melodies for woodwind instruments (Project 7), I first researched what types of instruments exist in the woodwind family, how to write for them, and what techniques they can achieve.</p>



<p>I found Samuel Adler&#8217;s book The Study of Orchestration to be an excellent resource for learning about orchestral instruments.</p>



<h2 id="classification" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1630378076466 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Classification</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Woodwind instruments are classified according to their families, reed type, pipe shape, intervals, and transposition (Adler, 2002). Classifying by family, in my opinion, makes more sense:</p>



<ol class="is-style-default"><li>The flute family &#8211; picollo, flute, alto flute, bass flute. The recorder is omitted since is not used in modern symphony orchestra (Adler, 2002).</li><li>The oboe family &#8211; oboe, oboe d&#8217;amour, English horn, hecklephone, bassoon, contrabassoon</li><li>The clarinet family &#8211; C, D, Eb, Bb, and A clarinets, alto clarinet (Eb), bass clarinet (generally in Bb, sometimes in Eb), contrabass clarinet (Bb or Eb), basset horn (F)</li><li>The saxophone family &#8211; sopranino (usually in Eb), soprano (Bb), alto (Eb), tenor (Bb), baritone (Eb), and bass saxophone (Bb) </li></ol>



<h2 id="transposition" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1630378089007 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Transposition</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>A transposing instrument generates pitches that aren&#8217;t the same as what&#8217;s on the page. <a href="http://www.orchestralibrary.com/reftables/rang.html#woodwinds" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.orchestralibrary.com/reftables/rang.html#woodwinds" target="_blank">This reference table, which I found on the website orchestralibrary.com</a>, is quite valuable because it includes not only the instrument range but also their transpositions.</p>



<p>The fundamental rule for all transposing instruments is that the written C will sound the instrument&#8217;s designated pitch. (2002, Adler)</p>



<h2 id="techniques" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1630379582051 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Techniques</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Woodwinds may generate a variety of techniques, and while it varies per instrument, most techniques are more difficult to manage in extreme registers than in middle registers (Adler, 2002).</p>



<h5 id="vibrato">Vibrato</h5>



<p>By default, the player can choose when to use vibrato, and the composer needs only to indicate <em>senza vibrato</em> or <em>non vibrato</em> if he does not want vibrato to be performed.</p>



<h5 id="tonguing-and-phrasing">Tonguing and phrasing</h5>



<p>A woodwind instrument&#8217;s articulations are affected by tonguing with a tuh-like or a duh-like sound. Unless there is a slur, notes are articulated separately and tongued. If there are slurs, notes are played in one breath with tongue only used on the first note. It is called legato.</p>



<h5 id="staccato">Staccato</h5>



<p>A dot above or below the note will produce a very short note with a natural separation between notes.</p>



<h5 id="soft-tonguing">Soft tonguing</h5>



<p>Soft tonguing is represented by slurs written in notes with dots or slashes. It has the same impact as slurred staccato.</p>



<h5 id="double-tonguing">Double tonguing</h5>



<p>In quick passages, double tonguing is used to produce a sound similar to te ke.</p>



<h5 id="dynamic-envelopes">Dynamic envelopes</h5>



<p>Moving from a strong attack to a lower volume and then back up to a higher level creates a powerful effect. Although woodwinds are not the only instruments that can achieve this effect, they are the greatest at it.</p>



<h5 id="flutter-tongue">Flutter tongue</h5>



<p>This effect creates a rolled <em>r</em> sound, which is common in woodwind instruments. Except for oboes and bassoons, it&#8217;s simple to play on most instruments. To create the optimum sound, the flutter tongue may require extended notes or complete passages. <em>Flutter tongue</em> or <em>flatterzunge</em> must be noted above the passage in the score.</p>



<h5 id="other-special-effects">Other special effects</h5>



<p>Multiphonics, when an instrument produces more than a note.</p>



<p>Glissandi, can be used in the upward direction, especially in clarinet and saxophone.</p>



<p>Slap tonguing produces a perky and snappy attack.</p>



<p>Key clicking, when the player slaps the notes without blowing air.</p>



<p>Whistle tones, when the player turns the instrument far from the face and blows across it.</p>

		<span>Jacques Ibert – Pièce for flute alone</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>This work, written in 1936, was influenced by the movement started by&nbsp;Debussy&#8217;s Syrinx, to&nbsp;write&nbsp;for flute without accompaniment (Lee, 2018). Flute pieces were not very prevalent during the baroque era as solo instrument.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until the instrument&#8217;s development around the turn of the XX&nbsp;century that a large number of flute players emerged and began commissioning new works for the instrument. (Toff,&nbsp;2012). Pièce for solo flute by Jaques Ibert was written for the French flautist Marcel Moyse.</p>

<p>This piece&#8217;s theme appeals to me much. It&#8217;s actually really simple. The supertonic and tonic dotted crochets are followed by six quavers, all in the Db scale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="168" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png" alt="" class="wp-image-267" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png 724w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-640x149.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p>I find this theme particularly appealing because these two notes work together like a sigh. The supertonic represents an inhale and the tonic represents a exhale. Since this piece was written in 1937, between the two great wars, I would say that its motif captures both the hope and disbelief of humanity. Are we going to be at war again? Perhaps not. Inhale. Or most likely, yes. Exhale. After these two notes, there is an answer to the question. Occasionally, they are optimistic and go up (bars 25 and 26), but they are usually pessimistic and go down.</p>



<p>There are 4 parts to this piece: Introduction &#8211; Part A &#8211; Part B &#8211; Part A&#8217;.</p>



<h2 id="introduction" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876025605 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Introduction</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The work begins with a gradual but increasing repetition of D, eventually developing to a quicker sequence of semiquavers and demisemiquavers. This introduction includes a rhythmic portion as well as a wide range of notes that demonstrate the flute&#8217;s tonal diversity. D4 to D6. It culminates in an ascension that leads to the main theme.</p>



<h2 id="part-a" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875870212 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The theme is presented and repeated to establish that this will be a recurring motif in all music and that the listener will remember it. Following that, Ibert interacts with the theme and cadence, frequently ending in surprising notes. It continues until bar 34, when it returns to the original theme but briefly switches to the Gb scale before returning to the D. The question (are we going to be at war?) is left unresolved at the end of this section.</p>



<h2 id="part-b" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876008964 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part B</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Part A is disrupted by this section. It momentarily switches to 9/8 time signature before switching to 3/4 &#8211; 2/4. There&#8217;s also a wave-like tune that conveys some anxiousness and unease. This is also sensed as we transition from a major to a minor scale. It&#8217;s the song&#8217;s most energizing section.</p>



<h2 id="part-a-2" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875998799 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A&#8217;</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>We return to the motif, but this time raised an octave. I believe that the composer needed to bring the listener back to the familiarity of the theme without losing the rush because we just came from such an exciting section. The melody then returns to its original octave, bringing us back home. We keep the sigh, just like we did at the start because the music provides no answers to the initial inquiry. Inhale, then exhale. And the piece ends in Db, which is a semitone below the composition&#8217;s starting note. The Db is repeated in the last bar, but two octaves lower. I don&#8217;t think it contributes anything to the finish and, in my opinion, should be omitted, just as Moyse did in the performance above.</p>



<p>When I started researching for this piece, I discovered that this is one of the most popular pieces among flute students. I&#8217;m beginning to see why. Ibert demonstrates the flute&#8217;s versatility throughout these 5 minutes of music, from trills to rapidly rising and falling scales, to the lovely two notes from the theme that, if performed effectively, can convey the optimism/pessimism duality that I believe the composer was attempting to portray.</p>

	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Alan Hovhaness &#8211; Lament for Clarinet</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Hovhaness was an Armenian-American composer who lived in the United States. Although I can&#8217;t discover a backstory for the Lament for Clarinet (1935), the Armenian exodus is a central motif in his Exile Symphony, which was written a year later (1936). (Athens, 2016). As a result, it&#8217;s plausible to assume that this sombre work was influenced by the Armenian situation in the United States and around the world.</p>

<p>This piece doesn&#8217;t appear to have a rigid structure, except for the main theme in bar 23 that is repeated with variations several times. There is also a motif featured at the beginning of the piece and repeated intermittently throughout.</p>



<p>The main theme consists of a fast rise from F to C, which is then sustained for nearly a full bar. Then there&#8217;s a quaver-crochet pattern that creates the impression that the character is walking or moving, but extremely slowly, as if dragging something, like a great pain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="211" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-1024x211.png" alt="" class="wp-image-276" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-1024x211.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-300x62.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-768x158.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-1536x317.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-640x132.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35-960x198.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-26-at-14.58.35.png 1640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The first notes, in my opinion, do an excellent job of portraying the composer&#8217;s grief. It reminds me of Sodade, a song by Cape Verdean singer Cesária Évora. It&#8217;s also a lament for her hometown, which she misses. The chorus&#8217;s initial two notes are a fast rise from G&nbsp;to C, akin to Hovaness&#8217; piece.</p>

<p>This informs me that the clarinet is excellent at resonating with the human voice, which I believe Hovaness was attempting to demonstrate in this piece. The clarinet sings a human grief.</p>



<p>This piece begins with a fast crescendo that demonstrates the clarinet&#8217;s vast range (F3 to C6). Everything slows down after this fast crescendo, with long sustained notes and a bend. I had no idea the clarinet could bend notes, which is fascinating to me. It has a lot of potentials to enhance mourning, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The composer then begins his exploration of the clarinet&#8217;s chalumeau register, with lower pitch notes, which, once again, is an excellent choice for passing the song&#8217;s sadness.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t figure out what scale the composer is using, although the majority of the notes picked sound exotic to me. I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s an Indian scale.</p>



<p>The theme is repeated four times, each time with slight modifications, but always ending on a lower pitch than when it began. It seems to be stating that no matter how hard the character tries to move up, it always ends up going down.</p>



<p>Then, with the reprise of the rising from the song&#8217;s beginning, there&#8217;s a ray of hope. A repetition of bars 19-21,  but again we return to a lower tone as if the character refuses to let go of his or her misery. Several times, hitting&nbsp;the same note, A.</p>



<p>We return to the main theme, always with the sadness of concluding on a lower tone than we began.</p>



<p>Here we begin a dialogue between hope and lament. Hope is a repetition of the preceding fast-rising, but this time it ascends to Db6, the highest note in all music. It&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s our character&#8217;s final hope, followed by a repeat of the first bar. Our character, on the other hand, gives up and plays the same notes for two bars.</p>



<p>Hopes responds by repeating the ascending to the highest tone. However, our character is slowly dying (the composer wrote the morendo in the score), with the semiquavers and crochets gradually fading to the low notes.</p>



<p>This composition struck me as very sad, and I believe that was the composer&#8217;s intention. Probably because of its history and all the stories he must have witnessed and experienced. Hovhaness was very familiar with the clarinet and its expressive possibilities (Wolverton, 2002), so it&#8217;s no surprise that this piece captures the melancholy and lament so beautifully.</p>



<p>As I previously stated, the clarinet has the ability to express human emotions, and when effectively crafted, it can feel as though there is a highly varied singer behind this instrument. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll remember this in my upcoming compositions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the composers with whom I most identify is Claude Debussy. So when I stumbled across this piece when researching pentatonic scale melodies, I knew I&#8217;d like it. I was not mistaken.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>My primary focus during this analysis will be on melody since that&#8217;s the component of the unit I&#8217;m studying.</p>



<p>This work, written by Claude Debussy between 1909 and 1910 for piano, was later transferred to a variety of other instruments.</p>



<p>The theme is introduced with a simple but lovely melodic line consisting entirely of Gb major pentatonic notes. I find this melody to be interesting because it ascends and descends in the pentatonic scale &#8212; in theory, that may sound boring, but it&#8217;s rather pleasing to listen to in this case.</p>



<p>The theme is then repeated, but instead of going up and down like the first time, we start descending the Gb scale in bar 10. This indicates that the music is going forward and not stuck in the same repetitive pattern, which should be uninteresting.</p>



<p>The work maintains its wave-like melody, but at bar 15, during one of the dramatic ascends, we switch to the Cb major pentatonic scale, reaching the highest note in the piece thus far. The melody then gradually descends in the Gb major scale, with the one quaver &#8211; two semiquavers that are so characteristic of this work, bringing familiarity and tranquillity to the music.</p>



<p>In bar 19, the score states &#8220;Un Peu Animé&#8221;, which I believe is the start of the song&#8217;s climax, where we ascend into three octaves in the scale of Eb Major and reach the highest note so far in the melody.</p>



<p>After the exhilaration of the finale, the primary theme returns, offering familiarity and security once more. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that this theme is a chord-based version of the familiar motif.</p>



<p>It all comes to a halt at bar 28 when the motif returns, but this time an octave higher. This gives the music a lot of tranquillity and a little dreaminess, in my opinion. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re reminiscing about how it all began. It&#8217;s also a little nostalgic.</p>



<p>In bar 33, we repeat bar 14, which brings us to the end of the song. The PP and minims make sure we reach a safe and stable conclusion.</p>



<p>Finally, I was drawn to this music since it is a singable melody that employs simple and common scales. This is the kind of melody I enjoy writing, and I&#8217;m hoping to get some inspiration from Debussy in Assignment 2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C. This song from the eighteenth century piqued my curiosity, so I decided to investigate it more.</p>



<p>The lyrics are as follows, in their literal translation:</p>



<p>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>Sweet-smelling, beautiful, stems full of buds<br>Fragrant and white, everyone praises<br>Let me pluck you down<br>Give to someone else<br>Jasmine flower, oh jasmine flower</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When I first read this score, the slurs between two notes, going one tone up or down, gave it a very pleasant Chinese characteristic sound. It&#8217;s almost like a vocal slide that makes you feel either eager or peaceful depending on which direction you&#8217;re facing.</p>



<p>The song begins with a simple phrase that progresses from E to C, the song&#8217;s highest note, and then down to G. The song proceeds to a calmer section after the repetition of the first phrase, with mostly crochets and note repetition. It eventually descends to C, one octave lower than the highest C.</p>



<p>The last section is when the slur is used more frequently, most likely because the melody shifts from praising the jasmine blossom to taking it up and offering it to someone else. After ascending to the highest C, the song begins to descend to the lowest note, G. I believe the impression of falling down is achieved using this slurs going from E to lower G. It was strikingly beautiful to me.</p>



<p>I then went to Youtube to look for more versions of this song, and I came across this one by the Choir of St John&#8217;s College Cambridge, which I thought was the most fascinating arrangement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The purpose of this project, which is part 2 of the program, is to compose three short contrasting melodies for vocals based on the pentatonic scale. To keep them engaging, it&#8217;s a good idea to be conscious of the dynamics, tempo, and rhythm.</p>

<p>I attempted to make things as simple as possible in my first exercise, concentrating mostly on the melody shape. It&#8217;s written in C, but I begin in E to add interest and to allow the melody to descend a little to lead the listener to the highest note in the melody.</p>

<p>I opted to develop an exercise with the F# pentatonic because it can be played on the piano&#8217;s black keys. It began to sound Chinese to me, so I went with it. It ended up having a straight melody shape, starting low, rising, going down, going higher, falling, going up a little and ending almost straight.</p>

<p>After hearing Debussy&#8217;s La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin, I was drawn to the main motif&#8217;s &#8220;wave&#8221; shape. I wanted to create a melody that resembled waves. I used the Bb pentatonic, but there&#8217;s a modulation to Eb in the middle, then back to Bb in the conclusion.</p>

		<span>The universal language</span>

</h2>



<p>I must confess that, aside from knowing what the pentatonic scale was, I had no idea how important it was in music. I used to think it was a simple scale that was mostly used in nursery rhymes and was used as the first scale a novice learns.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that I was not mistaken, after viewing this incredible video by musician Anuja Kamat, I realized that the pentatonic scale is used all over the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>But why is the pentatonic scale employed by ancient civilizations and people all across the world? Mathematics and frequency are the keys to the solution. Because all notes have a straightforward relationship between them, as illustrated in the points below, all notes sound good. As a result, they appeal to everyone&#8217;s ears.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>tonic has whatever frequency&nbsp;you first chose</li><li>supertonic has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1⅛</li><li>mediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1¼</li><li>dominant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1½</li><li>submediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1⅔</li><li>tonic (octave above) has the frequency of orginal tonic&nbsp;multiplied by 2</li></ul>



<p>The pentatonic scale appears in a variety of musical styles, which is fascinating. In the Chinese folk tune Mo Li Hua, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In the well-known Amazing Grace, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="96" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-300x28.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-768x72.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-640x60.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-960x90.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image.png 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Hold On We&#8217;re Going Home by Drake is another song that uses the pentatonic scale, which is quite prevalent in pop music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="79" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-300x23.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-768x59.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1536x119.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-2048x159.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-640x50.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-960x74.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1.png 2066w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It is also employed by classical composers. Debussy&#8217;s La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin contains another melody based on the pentatonic scale (except for an F).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.teoria.com/res/images/articles/debussy-fille-aux-cheveux-des-lin/tema.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>It makes me wonder whether maybe the pentatonic scale is the so-coveted universal language. A common language shared by people from various places, cultures, and eras. Even if two persons from completely different cultures and musical backgrounds are brought together, they may agree that these five notes sound good. </p>



<p>This Bob McFerrin story exemplifies it perfectly.</p>

<p>Although I still believe the pentatonic scale is a simple scale, I now recognize its significance in music and the vast possibilities it offers. I&#8217;m going to use them in the pentatonic scale melody project I&#8217;m working on.</p>

		<span>I started this course two months ago and already feel like I&#8217;ve come a long way.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Prior to this, I had never written music in notation, had no experience with Sibelius, and my only understanding of percussion instruments was limited to those found in a rock drum kit.</p>



<p>During these two months, I read various books and watched videos to better grasp how to notate music, how to listen to music, and how different instruments sound. Among my sources are:</p>

	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>About Assignment 1</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Following the finishing of the composition, I&#8217;m quite satisfied with the outcome, despite the fact that it took me longer than I anticipated. But I have to admit that making a plan ahead of time helped me stay focused and save time. This is an important lesson to remember for future projects.</p>



<p>As with all challenges, there were some parts that were easier than others.</p>



<p>Because of my professional background, I found the narrative section to be the most straightforward to write, therefore it was the first thing I did. Another thing that came naturally to me was writing themes depending on the story I wanted to tell.</p>



<p>Working with unpitched instruments was the most difficult part for me, and I often felt like I needed a pitched instrument to make a melody. Along the way, I discovered that employing various sounding percussion instruments might help in the creation of a melody. That&#8217;s what I sought to achieve with my composition.</p>



<p>Another challenge I faced was figuring out how to use the rests. Mostly, because most percussion instruments have such a short decay that the note&#8217;s duration is irrelevant and should be stated in an easy-to-read notation (Blatter and Blatter, 1997). I tried to make it simple for the players to read the rests by using the strong beat.</p>



<p>Overall, my ability to construct a 2-minute composition exceeded my expectations. The use of the variable meter has especially&nbsp;impressed me. I found it really beneficial in transmitting the devils&#8217; sense of disorder, and I ended up using it a lot more than I expected. On the other side, I believe I could do a better job of not using too many notes, or complicating things too much.</p>



<p>The key takeaway from this composition is that creating music in notation allows me to think more slowly about each section of the song and to delve deeper into each particular instrument.</p>



<p>As I previously stated, this was my first time using just percussion and non-pitched instruments, and my aim is that it will provide me with the foundations to write with a variety of instruments, specially tuned ones.</p>

		<span>Assignment 1: A composition for a group of untuned percussion</span>

</h2>



<p>The first assignment&#8217;s brief is really exciting: to complete an unfinished ballet score called Wild Dance, of which only the first 14 bars have been completed and the sole indication is: Curtain rises &#8211; enter a group of demons. The goal is to create a complete composition with unpitched percussion that lasts between 2 and 3 minutes.</p>



<p>I looked deeper into the composition and made a few tweaks to the concept after<a href="/project-4-about-structure/" data-type="URL" data-id="/project-4-about-structure/" target="_blank"> the plan I developed in Project 4</a>. The most notable difference is in the narrative, which has an impact on the structure.</p>



<p>You can find the score <a href="https://bit.ly/pedroassignment1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://bit.ly/pedroassignment1" target="_blank">here</a> and listen to it below:</p>

<p>Do you know how you feel when you&#8217;re about to do something that makes you uncomfortable? Maybe the first time you kissed a person you loved? Or when you&#8217;re taking an exam that you haven&#8217;t prepared for? Or every time you perform in front of a large crowd?</p>



<p>A lot of things happen in your head: adrenaline rushes, you feel dizzy, and your mind is filled with conflicting thoughts. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; &#8220;What if everything goes wrong?&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m not prepared,&#8221; &#8220;I think I can do it!&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221;<br>Inside your head, it&#8217;s like a war between demons and angels.</p>



<p>This is the subject of this piece. Sometimes the angels prevail, and other times your anxieties triumph. Demons win in this one.</p>

</h2>



<p><strong>Part A</strong> Bars 1 &#8211; 30</p>



<p>This section serves as an introduction, introducing the demons. I decided to keep the provided piece and extend it until the 30th Bar. The provided score begins with a motif that I utilized to introduce the demons. I used the same instruments as the demons: cymbals, tambourine, snare, and bass drum.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39.png" alt="" class="wp-image-188" width="234" height="291" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39.png 500w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39-241x300.png 241w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39-300x373.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px" /></figure>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 15-16 are the repetition of bars 3-4.</li><li>Bars 17-18 the tambourine is silenced for the first bar, and the 7/8 time signature is introduced to offer some variety to the dance.</li><li><meta charset="utf-8">Bars 19-20 are the repetition of bars 3-4.</li><li>Bar 21 the tambourine comes to a halt to give the rhythm a break.</li><li><meta charset="utf-8">Bars 22-23 are the repetition of bars 3-4.</li><li>Bars 24-26 the tambourine increases the strokes towards the end of the first part.</li><li>Bars 27-30 the bass drum and snare drum mimic each other until the end. </li></ul>



<p><strong>´</strong></p>



<p><strong>Part B </strong>Bars 31 &#8211; 77</p>



<p>Here we have the attack of the demons. Although the tempo is the same, the intensity is bigger with the snare having more prominence than in the introduction, giving the feeling of a faster section. I kept the variable meter from the introduction, as it passes the sense of nervousness. </p>



<p>I thought of an attack motif as an inversion of the time signature of the introduction, 3/8 &#8211; 5/8 instead of 5/8 &#8211; 3/8, to give some familiarity while maintaining the 3 2 3. This motif ends with a small pause since I want to give the listener the feeling of hesitation. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.18.43.png" alt="" class="wp-image-197" width="244" height="302" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.18.43.png 684w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.18.43-242x300.png 242w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.18.43-300x372.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.18.43-640x793.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></figure>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled has-regular-font-size"><li>Bar 31 the Part B starts with a wink to Part A, with the crescendo working as the launch of the attack. I repeat it several times to work as the launch of each attack. </li><li>Bars 32-41 the snare establishes the motif. </li><li>Bars 42-46 are the repetition of bars 31-35 with some modifications.</li><li>Bars 47-57 the tambourine substitutes the snare and derives from the motif.</li><li>Bars 58-67 the motif continues and the cymbal strikes more often, reaching the climax.</li><li>Bars 68-71 the first part of the motif is repeated to reach the climax and end the Part B</li><li>Bars 72-77 the ritardando is used to transmit the demons&#8217; tiredness and build a bridge to Part C, with the Tam-Tam and Bass Drum (Bar 76) ending it.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Part C</strong> Bars 78 &#8211; 98</p>



<p>Part C is devoted to the angels. This section contrasts with the previous ones by being slower and with fewer instrument strikes. I want the listener to breathe from the previous strikes and to prepare for the following ones. For the angels&#8217; instruments, I picked Finger Cymbals &#8211; Cabasa &#8211; Bongos &#8211; Bass Drum. The motif came after I watched the tremolo Finger Cymbal technique in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt6nyCLf45s" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt6nyCLf45s" target="_blank">this Zildjian video</a>. I liked how spacial it sounded. Then I thought that the cabasa would be a good fit for the Finger Cymbals, so I researched some playing techniques and ended up finding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAwVq2VbBbc" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAwVq2VbBbc" target="_blank">this video</a> showing the player hitting the cabasa and shaking it, which sounded perfect for me. The Bass drum provides the base rhythm and the Bongos provide the dance rhythm.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10.png" alt="" class="wp-image-199" width="253" height="298" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10.png 740w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10-254x300.png 254w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10-300x354.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10-640x756.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" /></figure>



<p>The time signature is always 5/8 &#8211; 5/8 &#8211; 6/8 to keep it simple and predictable.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 78-80 establishes the motif, ending in a kind of delay sound for the cabasa.</li><li>Bars 81-94 are the repetition of the motif but with the bongos providing the danceable rhythm.</li><li>Bars 95-98 the repetition and the acceleration of the snare brings us a new attack, to the B&#8217; part.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Part B&#8217;</strong> Bars 99 &#8211; 120</p>



<p>This reprise is a shortened version of Part B, where the motif is repeated at first, but then the tambourine joins the snare in a new pattern to gain force in this last attack. In the end, they defeat the angels.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 99-103 are the repetition of the 32-35 bars.</li><li>Bars 104-116 we can hear the last attack, the tambourine joins the snare and the cymbal joins the bass drum. All instruments grow in presence.</li><li>Bars 117-120 are a passage to the closing. The claves enter to make a celebratory dance, very childish and naive, but very simple. Only later I noticed it sounds like the intro of Rage Against The Machine&#8217;s Killing In The Name.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Part C&#8217;</strong> Bars 121 &#8211; 136</p>



<p>The dance ends as it started, but is slower. Since the demons won, they don&#8217;t need to make all the rush they did at the beginning, but can make a slow and confident victory dance. Ending with the same motif from the beginning makes a full circle, meaning that like the demons in your head, they always come and go, and this is not an isolated battle.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 121-128 are the repetition of bars 3-10, with the little addition of bass drum to add more base sound, because of the slower tempo.</li><li>Bars 129-130 the repetition continues but with the increase of the cymbal and snare.</li><li>Bars 131-136 the cymbal has a little motif of 5 consecutive strokes with all the other instruments increasing in strokes until the end.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The goal of this final project, which comes before the first assignment, is to create a plan for the assignment composition, which should last between 2 and 3 minutes and begin with the specified composition.</p>



<p>One thing I noticed is that it is suggested that the plan begins with the structure before deciding on the content. However, when I look at Assignment 1, I find that it begins with a group of demons entering the scene. As a result, I&#8217;m reluctant to separate the idea from the structure. So I decided to start with the idea/story and then go on to the structure.</p>



<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>



<p>When I first read &#8220;Curtain Rises, enter a group of demons&#8221; at the start of assignment 1, I immediately thought of the devils that pop into your head from time to time. Particularly when you&#8217;re going to do something that makes you feel uneasy. For example, for me, it was when I began writing music in notation, which I had never done before. All of your demons begin to rush through your head in the form of doubts such as &#8220;will I be able to do this?&#8221; and &#8220;why did I even start this course?&#8221;</p>



<p>For this piece, I decided to explore the battle between spirits (doubts, anxieties, self-censorship) and demons (confidence, tranquillity, wisdom) that happen inside your head when you&#8217;re about to do something uncomfortable.</p>



<h2 id="the-structure">The Structure</h2>



<p>Starting with the given Wild Dance composition, I opted to utilize the specified tempo (153 bpm) as the demons tempo since it conveys a sense of haste and chaos. By contrast, the angels will move at a slower pace, conveying a sense of tranquillity. </p>



<p>As I previously stated, my composition will be about a clash&nbsp;in which demons arrive and attack, angels defend, demons counter-attack and the angels ultimately triumph. I want the audience to sense this conflict, which will be reflected in the speed and instrument shifts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular cnvs-block-core-table-1628498574118"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A &#8211; A horde of demons appear on stage, dancing around the angels and provoking them. The angels are standing calmly nearby.</td><td>Principal</td><td>~30 seconds at 153 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>B &#8211; The demons strike with hesitation, insecurity, and anxiety.</td><td>Principal</td><td>~40 seconds at 153 bpm</td></tr><tr><td>C- The angels continue to live in peace. They are composed, self-assured, and wise. They don&#8217;t desire war, so they demonstrate this by dancing slowly and peacefully.</td><td>Subsidiary</td><td>~40 seconds at 85 bpm</td></tr><tr><td>B&#8217;-The demons retaliate, but they&#8217;re growing nervous.</td><td>Reprise</td><td>~20 seconds at 153 bpm</td></tr><tr><td>C&#8217;-The angels grow in strength and distance themselves from the demons.</td><td>Closing</td><td>~20 seconds at 153 bpm</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="the-motifs">The motifs</h2>



<p>I developed some themes for each section. The first one will serve as an introduction and the example is already delivered, which heavily uses the tambourine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39.png" alt="" class="wp-image-188" width="270" height="336" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39.png 500w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39-241x300.png 241w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39-300x373.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /></figure>



<p>In the B section, I imagined the demons&#8217; strike to be powerful, but with a slight hesitation at the end.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31.png" alt="" class="wp-image-189" width="277" height="346" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31.png 508w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31-240x300.png 240w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31-300x374.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></figure>



<p>The angels in the C portion are calm, assertive, and peaceful. It will contrast with the prior two motifs&#8217; warlike snare.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45.png" alt="" class="wp-image-190" width="281" height="323" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45.png 514w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45-261x300.png 261w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45-300x344.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /></figure>



<h2 id="the-instruments">The instruments</h2>



<p>For the demons parts, I chose the given instruments (Bass Drum, Snare Drum, Tambourine, Cymbal) because I believe they convey the sense of urgency and aggression I want to portray. In addition to the Bass Drum, a rhythmic instrument, the angels will also use the Bongos, Cabasa, and Finger Cymbals.</p>



<p>For simplicity, I retained four instruments for each part, and since I want it to be played by four musicians, they only have to switch between two instruments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This project&#8217;s goal is to create two studies using at least three untuned percussion instruments. Despite the fact that I could have used some of the examples provided as a starting point for my work, I chose to build them from scratch.</p>



<p>While I thought using more instruments would be easier, the variety of instruments available and the techniques for each instrument were overwhelming. I often worked on a single instrument and then realized it didn&#8217;t fit well with the others, forcing me to rewrite it. That took longer than I anticipated.</p>



<p>A characteristic that I noticed about some of the percussion compositions I listened to is that they are coupled with dance or body movements. Therefore, the central focus of both of my studies is on expressive dance and bodily movement.</p>



<h2 id="study-1">Study 1</h2>



<p>My professional background is in advertising, and as I started thinking about this first research, I remembered an old Lacoste commercial called The Leap. This video shows a couple sitting at a coffee table, with the boy preparing to kiss the girl for the first time. The film then turns to a metaphor for what&#8217;s going on inside his head: a massive leap into the unknown. I immediately thought of my <a href="https://pedrovintem.000webhostapp.com/2021/07/project-1-percussion-solos" target="_blank">first study of Taiko</a> and how it is linked to breathing rhythm. Due to this, I chose the video and the Taiko as the basis for my initial study.</p>



<p>I decided Taiko was the foundation of this composition, the heart, and then I added instruments that I thought might be able to bring the breath rhythm to life. Wood Blocks first function as an echo of the heart (Taiko) and then as the rush of the mind. The snare brings a marching strength that reminds me of running. The tam-tam is used as a reminder of the character&#8217;s great action&#8217;s danger. Cabasas are merely used to cause confusion and dizziness.</p>



<p>When I was looking for information on instrument techniques, I came upon <a href="https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/instruments/percussion/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/instruments/percussion/" target="_blank">Philharmonia&#8217;s excellent webpage</a> on percussion instruments. There, I examined the tam-tam and one unique technique in which the musician rubs a triangular stick against the tam-tam&#8217;s edge&nbsp;to produce a harsh sound. If the player rubbed it gently enough, it could simulate the sound of the wind.</p>



<p>There are three parts to this piece:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The acceleration of breathing</li><li>The suspension of jumping</li><li>The unpredictability of the first kiss</li></ul>



<p>As much as possible, I tried to make it concise and interesting while staying true to the main idea. My 3rd section used a time change from 5/4 to 3/4 in order to help create some confusion. The ending was inspired by my first <a href="https://pedrovintem.000webhostapp.com/2021/06/listening-to-arthur-honegger-cello-sonata-h-20-iii-presto" target="_blank">listening of Honegger</a>, with the ending feeling incomplete (just like every first kiss, you want more from the moment) in a 4/4 bar rather than a 5/4 bar.</p>

<h2 id="study-2">Study 2</h2>



<p>This study was inspired by flamenco dances I watched as a kid. There were times when a male and female dancer alternated. The idea behind this song is to create a classic storyline in which a girl meets a boy and in the end, they dance together.</p>



<p>I have divided this piece into three parts:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The girl is introduced</li><li>The boy is introduced</li><li>They both dance together</li></ul>



<p>I attempted to use some Latin instruments, but because some of them were unfamiliar to me, I had to do some additional research into their techniques.</p>



<p>The Cajon and Tambourine offer the rhythm&#8217;s foundation. I looked at Vic Firth&#8217;s tutorials for the tambourine, particularly the usage of the thumb roll as a gentle and long roll that could fit this rhythm. Because I couldn&#8217;t find a standardized method to notate the Cajon, I created a two-line stave with the low strokes on the bottom line and the high strokes on the top line.</p>



<p>The girl is represented by the Castanets and the Guiro. For me, the Guiro was a whole new instrument. After seeing and listening to Guiro rhythms, I decided to keep it basic and only provide some context for the Castanets.</p>



<p>Bongos and Claves symbolize the boy. Cajon&#8217;s low pitch led me to choose Bongos instead of Congas since they are higher pitched. It is written in two-line Bongo notation.</p>

		<span>Variations, rhythm and all that jazz.</span>

</h2>



<p>I listened to all 16 variations from Boris Blacher&#8217;s Variations On A Paganini Theme, but I was curious how it sounded and looked in a concert, so I watched a performance by the Frankfurt Radio Symphony.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>The Paganini Caprice theme fades away after a few seconds, and Blacher&#8217;s variants come to life on their own. There&#8217;s a little resemblance to it now and then, but it&#8217;s really subtle. Another thing I noticed is that Blacher strives to showcase all instruments through the variations, starting with strings, then on to woodwinds, and finally to brass. Percussion continues to come and go as the variants change. Despite the fact that I believe most of the variants to be quite vibrant rhythmically, there is no variation dedicated only to percussion.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a score, and despite the fact that different time signatures were used between variations, I couldn&#8217;t figure out if Variable Metre was used at all.</p>



<p>For me, the second&nbsp;and last two&nbsp;variations were the most intriguing. The second variation features a bluesy oboe with blue notes, which I adore (and it looks like the player from the performance I posted does too). The 15th and 16th have a jazzier flavour to them, and they remind me of big bands. That was a fantastic conclusion. &#8220;Dominant rhythm and abrupt ends are Blacher hallmarks,&#8221; (Simon, 2003) I realized after learning more about Blacher.</p>



<p>All of this jazz influence, and how he changed it into an orchestral sound, piqued my curiosity in Blacher, and I&#8217;m likely to listen to him more in the future, and perhaps include some of his influences into my works.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Side Note about Variations. I had no clue what variations were, let alone how popular Paganini&#8217;s theme was. Basically, variation form is when you take a song&#8217;s theme and investigate, mine, twist, and transform it into a new piece of art (Hough, 2013). It appears to me to be a creative exercise rather than the construction of completely new work. I enjoy the idea of variations, and I&#8217;m curious as to why there aren&#8217;t any big musicians that do variations of other artists&#8217; songs. This reminds me that some DJs are experimenting with several versions of the same song like Stereossauro did with Carlos Paredes&#8217; Verdes Anos.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Composing for two instruments should have been easy for me, but it turned out to be more difficult.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Composing for two instruments should have been easy for me, but it turned out to be more difficult. Beyond the obvious snare and bass drum, I had a hard time deciding which instruments should make a duet. Then I had difficulties getting it to function beyond the basic concept; I constantly felt like one instrument was missing.</p>



<p>The purpose of this project is to write four short compositions with at least eight bars each for two untuned instruments. The conversation between the instruments should be explored in the first two parts. The latter two should experiment with unusual time signatures &#8211; five and seven beats per bar, respectively.</p>



<h2 id="snare-drum-bass-drum">Snare Drum &amp; Bass Drum</h2>



<p>For the first study, I chose the one that was most comfortable for me. I&#8217;m familiar with the snare and bass drum&#8217;s characteristics, so I sought to create a piece that would explore a dialogue between the two. The goal is for each participant to &#8220;talk&#8221; in turn until they are both in unison. The second section of this composition was inspired by a scene from Carmen Suite (that I reviewed <a href="https://pedrovintem.000webhostapp.com/2021/07/listening-to-rodion-shchedrin-carmen-suite" target="_blank">here</a>), in which the Marimba and Vibrafono had a little dialogue.</p>

<h2 id="shaker-wood-block">Shaker &amp; Wood Block</h2>



<p>In this work, I had a concept of a conversation, but it&#8217;s one of those where one side does the majority of the talking while the other simply attempts to say something but finds it nearly impossible and eventually becomes frustrated. If I&#8217;m being frank, I think the shaker can be irritating if used frequently. I discovered George Crumb&#8217;s Music For a Summer Evening when researching the shaker. The use of the shaker piqued my interest, and it led me to conclude the conversation in bar 7.</p>

<h2 id="castanets-tambourine">Castanets &amp; Tambourine</h2>



<p>When I was listening to Carmen Suite, I noticed how the castanets were used to create a more danceable rhythm. I looked into what approaches could be used in the castanets for my third composition, but in the end, the flamenco dancers who hit their shoes on the floor to mark the rhythm inspired me more.</p>

<h2 id="triangle-cymbal">Triangle &amp; Cymbal</h2>



<p>With the last one, I wanted to go darker. In my perspective, the cymbal has either a massive marking when struck hard or a mystery marking when slammed softly. After seeing Vic Firth&#8217;s video with the suspended cymbal, I decided to use the Marimba Mallet&#8217;s deeper tone. However, because it is preferable to describe the desired sound rather than the mallet (Solomon, 2002), I put &#8220;dark.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s amusing that a quick Google search for [Variable Metre Boris Blacher] yields nearly exclusively results from OCA&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s amusing that a quick Google search for [Variable Metre Boris Blacher] yields nearly exclusively results from OCA students&#8217; blogs. Are we the only ones who have written on Variable Metre?</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not going to provide an entire biography of Boris Blacher here (an excellent summary can be found in Simon, 2003), but I did discover that he studied architecture before becoming a renowned composer. Probably that is why he developed the Variable Metre, which is made up of &#8220;patterns, certainly, but used as expressive building blocks&#8221; (Matthew-Walker 2003, p.24).</p>



<p>But first, let&#8217;s look at the formal definition of Variable Metre from The Oxford Dictionary of Music:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">[a rhythmical process] whereby systematic changes of metre are planned according to mathematical relationships.</p><cite>(Kennedy, Kennedy and Rutherford-Johnson, 2013)</cite></blockquote>



<p>I believe that it is simpler to say that Variable Metre is when a piece of music with a continual shift in time signature based on a numeric pattern. This pattern can have a mathematical relationship, but I don&#8217;t believe it is always true. It&#8217;s also easier to understand if you look at it:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1fZQ6vsTcWMsSif1J3uHEMJGXZ2JLKa2I" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Numbers below the tempo marker indicate the time signature, while dots indicate incremental changes to the next value.</p>



<p>Although some sources claim he did not invent Variable Metre (Quinn, 2005), he was most likely the one who developed it most.</p>



<p>I must admit that when I initially read the definition of Variable Metre, I was sceptical about whether or not I would enjoy hearing it. I agreed with critics who claimed that this method was more like eye-music than ear-music (Matthew-Walker 2003, p.24). My opinion changed when I heard his Piano Concerto No.2.</p>

<p>After hearing it multiple times and assessing which sections I loved the most and which parts I didn&#8217;t believe Variable Metre made a significant difference, I realized that this technique works best when the notes are&nbsp;repeated. In Konzert für Klavier und Orchester, No. 2: I. Allegro, this happens. You&#8217;re listening to the same thing over and over, but each time the time changes, a new puzzle piece is added. As if a block is being added to a building to make it more stunning. This enables the creation of anticipation and disruption. I believe these two qualities are&nbsp;appealing to the ear.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I believe it was worthwhile to learn about Variable Metre, but I find it difficult to think of it as anything more than a creative exercise if it is not utilized with repetition.</p>

<p>When I was researching the tambourine, I came across Rodion Shchedrin&#8217;s Carmen Suite for string orchestra and percussion (1967). </p>

<p>A little backstory. When Shchedrin&#8217;s wife, Maya Plisetskaya, asked Shostakovich to write a new Carmen ballet, he &#8220;gently but firmly refused.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of Bizet.&#8221; After that, she asked her husband, who agreed. Shostakovich&#8217;s response demonstrates Shchedrin&#8217;s bravery. After its debut performance, the Carmen Suite was deemed &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; to Bizet&#8217;s opera and was banned by the Soviet leadership. (Plisetskaya, 2001)</p>



<p>I feel that percussion, such as tubular bells, cymbals and castanets, are used throughout Shchedrin&#8217;s score to emphasize rhythms. Although he pays homage to the original material, he frequently pushes the music in unexpected ways, heightening the atmosphere and drama.</p>



<p>On&nbsp;the&nbsp;other&nbsp;side,&nbsp;I&nbsp;find&nbsp;the&nbsp;presence&nbsp;of&nbsp;percussion&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rather&nbsp;comic&nbsp;at&nbsp;times, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;timpani&nbsp;glissando&nbsp;is&nbsp;used&nbsp;or&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;strings&nbsp;provide&nbsp;distinctive&nbsp;effects. </p>



<p>Overall, I think the experiment of using percussion to replace other instruments was a great success, and the end result was quite entertaining. If it&#8217;s superior to the original? I don&#8217;t believe it is necessary to respond.</p>



<p>It reminded me of Johnny Cash&#8217;s Hurt version. It was a risky move for producer Rick Rubin to persuade Johnny Cash to record a version of Nine Inch Nail&#8217;s Hurt. Cash refused to sing the song, which was widely regarded as one of NIN&#8217;s best. It wasn&#8217;t until he read the lyrics that Cash realized he could make his own version of the song. Finally, the singer and producer managed to create a masterpiece from a masterpiece. It wasn&#8217;t better or worse than the original; rather, it was unique. Instead of being a song about drugs and self-destruction, they transformed it into an acoustic song about the epilogue of an eventful life.</p>

<p>Like NIN/Cash&#8217;s Hurt, Bizet/Shchedrin&#8217;s Carmen can exist in the music world indefinitely as two different but interconnected works that don&#8217;t have to be judged against each other.</p>

		<span>I have never composed for percussion before</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Composing exclusively for percussion is something new for me. In fact, composing in notation is also a first for me. Usually, I just sit at the piano and compose. I believe that creating in this way took me longer, but that time allowed me to go deeper into the instruments and better understand what I could do with them.</p>



<p>The lack of a standard for notating percussion instruments was the first hurdle I faced (Black and Gerou, 2005). As a result, to have a consistent notation, I used the Essential Dictionary of Orchestration. Also, because some percussion instruments have little or no natural resonance, I chose to change the note-length in order to have fewer rests, which keeps the piece from becoming cluttered and difficult to read (Solomon, 2002). </p>



<p>The&nbsp;goal&nbsp;for&nbsp;this&nbsp;project&nbsp;was&nbsp;to&nbsp;compose&nbsp;four&nbsp;short&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;for&nbsp;untuned&nbsp;instruments&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;choice. I chose the Triangle, the Snare Drum, the Taiko and the Tambourine.</p>



<h2 id="the-triangle" class="has-huge-font-size">The Triangle</h2>



<p>Because this is my first time composing for percussion, I chose to work with the triangle. Eric Hopes wrote it best when he said: &#8220;The truth is that anyone can play the triangle. It is one of the most basic musical instruments.&#8221; (How to Be a Professional Triangle Player | Musicians of the Utah Symphony, n.d.). To test it out, I started writing in a simple time signature, and it sounded good. A section of this work was influenced by Antonín Dvořák&#8217;s Symphony No. 9 in E minor (3rd movement), of which I discovered a performance of the triangle on Youtube.</p>

<h2 id="the-snare-drum" class="has-huge-font-size">The Snare Drum</h2>



<p>For me, the snare drum was an obvious option because it is the percussion instrument with which I am most familiar. Chop Suey! by System Of A Down began playing on my Spotify while I was composing this piece. I interpreted it as both a divine sign and a challenge. Could this song&#8217;s verse serve as inspiration for a snare solo? Yes, I believe so.</p>

<h2 id="the-taiko" class="has-huge-font-size">The Taiko</h2>



<p>Because I knew nothing about this instrument, I did some research and discovered the principle of &#8220;breath rhythm,&#8221; in which a piece&#8217;s metrical markers are sensed and played as the rhythm of breath (Powell, 2012). This inspired me to set the tempo to 64 because an adult breath rhythm is around 16 breaths per minute, multiplied by four equals 64. This piece, I believe, can translate your breathing before doing something exciting, such as fighting in a war or kissing someone for the first time. Your breathing quickens, you hold your breath for a brief moment, and then it&#8217;s all adrenaline.</p>

<h2 id="the-tambourine" class="has-huge-font-size">The Tambourine</h2>



<p>For me, this was not an obvious choice. I&#8217;d never given the tambourine much thought before, but when I was looking for instruments, I came across Edoardo Giachino&#8217;s video of him playing it and was inspired to use it in this project.</p>

<p>What I like about the tambourine is that it reminds me of Spanish/Latin sounds that I&#8217;m familiar with. Particularly in Bizet&#8217;s Carmen, which I may review later in my listening log. I attempted to create some fanfare in this piece. Fanfares are typically performed for brass or brass and percussion instruments (Florek, 2015), so I figured why not a tambourine fanfare?</p>

		<span>Thinking about percussion led me to a revolution.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>I remember going to a football stadium for the first time when I was six years old to see a game at the Sport Lisboa and Benfica stadium. A large concrete stadium with a capacity of roughly 120.000 spectators. The score was 0-0 at halftime, and the fans were growing concerned. Then something happened that I had never experienced before. The concrete benches began to shake, a rumbling sound grew louder, and it felt like an earthquake. It was the supporters&#8217; feet that stomped on the ground. Thousands of people making a rhythmic sound altogether. It was frightening, powerful and incredible. It was my first experience with live percussion. Benfica won by 3-0.</p>



<p>Beginning my music degree with a study of rhythm and percussion prompted me to look into the history of percussion instruments and their role in music. I ended up viewing Steven Schick&#8217;s presentation. </p>

Available at: &lt;http://University/ of California Television (UCTV)&gt; [Accessed 17 June 2021].</figcaption></figure>



<p>The presentation was entertaining and light while yet being instructive. One thing he said remained with me out of all the things he mentioned. His definition of percussion instruments.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>&#8220;[Percussion instruments] are simple objects that make sound by striking them.&#8221;</p><cite>University of California Television (UCTV), 2013.&nbsp;<em>On the Bridge: The Beginnings of Contemporary Percussion Music with Steven Schick &#8212; To Be Musical</em>.  Available at: &lt;http://University/ of California Television (UCTV)&gt; [Accessed 17 June 2021].</cite></blockquote>



<p>It&#8217;s really that simple. It&#8217;s so simple that I believe anyone, regardless of musical knowledge, can play a percussion instrument. And I believe that is why percussion is at the very beginning of this course. It&#8217;s simple, doable and fun. And yet it&#8217;s so powerful.</p>



<p>Steven Schick also mentions a quote by John Cage.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Percussion music is revolution.&#8221;</p><cite>Cage, J., 1973.&nbsp;<em>Silence</em>. Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, p.87.</cite></blockquote>



<p>John Cage, I believe, meant that percussion allowed musicians to break away from the constraints imposed by classical composers who used the same sounds. Percussion provided an opportunity for exploration. Anything that generated a sound when struck may be included in the music. And the terms &#8220;percussion&#8221; and &#8220;revolution&#8221; immediately brought José Afonso&#8217;s Grândola Vila Morena to mind. Since it was utilized as the start of the Portuguese revolution, this is one of the most emblematic Portuguese songs. Only voice and the sound of marching feet on gravel can be heard during the entire song. And it caused a revolution, politically and musically speaking. For me, that was because of percussion. Isn&#8217;t it percussion if you hit the gravel with your feet? It makes sound by striking them, right?</p>
