<p>My reviewed score can be accessed <a href="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Assignment-3-Revision-Full-Score.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Assignment-3-Revision-Full-Score.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>Although the tutor&#8217;s feedback was positive, he pointed out several issues, the biggest of which was the heavyweight of the B and C sections, compared to the lightness and elegance of the A section. The suggestion was that I offer some of the lightness of the beginning in the next sections, so there would be a balance between all sections.</p>



<p>Despite my attempts to incorporate some of the qualities of the opening into the C section, I was not able to do it because every time I tried to change it, I felt that I was losing my sense of what this piece was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, most of the changes were made in section B. Particularly the creation of a two-part counterpoint between the oboe and bassoon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I changed the key signature in the B section from C# to Db because, as the tutor pointed out, five flats are easier to read than seven sharps.</p>



<p>Because there were times when staccatos and repeated notes were under slurs, I reviewed them all. My tutor pointed out that this wasn&#8217;t modern standard notation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the tutor pointed out, the oboe and bassoon did not have any rests and the flute had very few rests. Throughout the piece, I added a few rests for all three instruments, without sacrificing the overall sonority I wanted. Other than the flute, which has a long rest in the middle section, I couldn&#8217;t find space for long rests on the other instruments.</p>



<p>It hadn&#8217;t occurred to me that the two first pages were denser than the rest, so I spread them out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Moving from monophonic to polyphonic music, in my opinion, was a significant step forward in terms of both complexity and creativity.</p>



<p>I had the opportunity to write for three instruments in this assignment, which proved to be more difficult than I anticipated, especially considering I had to write separate melodies for each of them. I can now better appreciate how great composers like Bach were able to compose in masterful harmony when they used 4 or more voices.</p>



<p>My hearing and analysis of rounds, descants, and, especially, polyphony, I believe, aided me in better understanding how voices might be written in harmony but with differing melodies.</p>



<h3 id="about-assignment-3">About Assignment 3</h3>



<p>As I previously stated, I found this task to be far more challenging than the prior two. Considering three instruments, each with their distinct melodies and &#8220;personalities,&#8221; brought a level of difficulty I hadn&#8217;t anticipated. However, I believe that this additional complexity will be advantageous in the long run as assignment tasks become longer and include more instruments.</p>



<p>In terms of notation, I made an effort to avoid some of the faults I made in earlier assignments, such as rhythmic spelling, correct beaming, and phrasing.</p>



<p>My ability to construct a two-minute composition and transpose the concepts I had in my head to a score surprised me. I wanted to compose a piece that put polyphony to work for the music rather than the other way around. The repeated theme and various small melodies throughout the music, I believe, made this polyphonic composition both familiar and fresh at the same time.</p>



<p>Being self-critical, I think this piece contains too many elements. As a result, I feel that I could turn this into a 4-minute musical piece that develops some of the ideas I wanted to include.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>My third task was to compose a work for three woodwind instruments in a mostly polyphonic approach. This composition should last about two minutes and follow a predetermined structure (seen below), in which one begins with a triad, moves to another, and concludes with another.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="358" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47-1024x358.png" alt="" class="wp-image-473" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47-1024x358.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47-300x105.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47-768x268.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47-640x224.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47-960x336.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-04-at-14.36.47.png 1190w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p><meta charset="utf-8">I had few questions after seeing example 45. Should the first triad last several bars? (If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;ll have to use different chords in the meanwhile, or it&#8217;ll sound stuck). Or is the example intended to be regarded as a chord progression that should be used throughout the piece?</p>



<p>My tutor assisted me with these questions by directing me to consider these triads as harmonic centres for the music.</p>



<p>With this in mind, I decided to use three triads, each representing a different essence of the music, resulting in a piece of music with three parts.</p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1634108541003 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Idea / Theme</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>After reflecting on my polyphonic studies, I came up with the idea for this composition. I listened to polyphonic music in three different styles: Renaissance, Baroque, and African/Polynesian polyphony. Because the assignment&#8217;s predetermined structure required three triads, I challenged myself to write a piece of music in three parts, each inspired by a different style of polyphonic music.</p>



<p>About the theme, this piece will be about a love triangle involving three instruments. After meeting and dancing in an African<meta charset="utf-8">/Polynesian section, they progressed to the baroque section, where they fell in love, then finalized the dance with a passionate and harmonious section (Renaissance), showcasing their love for one another.</p>



<h2 id="the-structure" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1634108659753 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Structure</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The structure was mostly determined upon the development of the idea. This would be a straightforward story in which A leads to B, which leads to C. I wanted the music to begin rhythmically as if the instruments were dancing together and each had its own individuality. Then, in a more melodic section, the instruments repeat the motif as though they discover something in common and fall in love. Ending in harmony and love, each instrument repeats the same motif but then each plays its own melodic line while respecting the harmony of the others.</p>



<p>I decided to produce a piece in the key of C# major after studying pentatonic scales. The other triads and keys were chosen based on the least amount of note change between them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular cnvs-block-core-table-1628498574118"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section &amp; Triad</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The instruments meet and dance together, each with its own personality</td><td>A &#8211; B major</td><td><meta charset="utf-8">~30 seconds at 110 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>They fall in love, repeating the same motif</td><td>B &#8211; C# major</td><td><meta charset="utf-8">~30 seconds at 70 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>They live happily ever after, each with their own motif but harmonically</td><td>C &#8211; Ab major</td><td>~60 seconds at 70 bpm</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Motifs</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>As I had done with prior projects and assignments, I began playing around with the piano, hoping to find a theme that sounded good to me and would serve as a catapult for this composition. After a time, I came upon a motif that I really loved and decided to go a little deeper into it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="75" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-1024x75.png" alt="" class="wp-image-480" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-1024x75.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-300x22.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-768x57.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-1536x113.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-2048x151.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-640x47.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-960x71.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Because the song is divided into three distinct sections, I thought it would be fascinating if the same motif appeared in each section, but was played differently and by different instruments. This way, something would connect all three pieces.</p>



<p>This motif is performed subtly in semiquavers in the A section by the oboe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="238" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-1024x238.png" alt="" class="wp-image-476" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-1024x238.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-768x178.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-1536x356.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-2048x475.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-640x149.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1-960x223.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-1.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The B section is played more explicitly and with quavers by the flute.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="100" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-3-1024x100.png" alt="" class="wp-image-478" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-3-1024x100.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-3-300x29.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-3-768x75.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-3-1536x151.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-3-2048x201.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-3-640x63.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-3-960x94.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-3.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The motif is performed by the bassoon nearly in the background with crochets in the C section.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="64" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-4-1024x64.png" alt="" class="wp-image-479" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-4-1024x64.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-4-300x19.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-4-768x48.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-4-1536x96.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-4-2048x127.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-4-640x40.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-4-960x60.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-4.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This division was quite helpful in enabling me to start writing each section quicker.</p>

		<span>The Instruments</span>

</h2>



<p>Flute, oboe, and bassoon were my natural choices for a woodwind trio. I chose these three instruments because I believe they complement each other in terms of timbre while remaining distinct enough for the listener to hear each one&#8217;s melody.</p>



<p>I listened to three pieces to gain a sense of how a trio of woodwinds works together and how other composers used these instruments.</p>



<p>One of the first instances I found of the three I selected to work with was Antonio Vivaldi&#8217;s Concerto for Flute, Oboe, and Bassoon in G Minor, RV 103. This composition didn&#8217;t particularly appeal to me, but it did teach me how much prominence the flute can have at times, as well as how the oboe and flute can sound good together without clashing, with the flute in a high register and the oboe in a middle and low register.</p>

<p>The Trio for Flute, Oboe, and Bassoon, Op. 86 by Röntgen was an excellent illustration of what I was attempting. Each instrument&#8217;s identity is respected alongside the melody, yet they also repeat each other. This adds a lot of depth to the music.</p>

<p>Pastorale for Wind Trio, Op. 147 by Darius Milhaud omits the flute but includes the clarinet. I was especially inspired by how wonderfully polyphony worked beginning in bar 24.</p>

</h2>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section A</strong> Bars 1-9</p>



<p>I intended to portray more rhythmic and fast-paced music in this section. As a result, I employed semiquavers in all three instruments and staccato most of the time.</p>



<p>This section is in the key of B major, although it begins with a D#m triad. The B major triad is present in the second beat of the first bar to create the home triad.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="376" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-1024x376.png" alt="" class="wp-image-481" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-1024x376.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-300x110.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-768x282.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-1536x564.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-2048x752.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-640x235.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-960x352.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23.png 2218w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The oboe and flute begin by playing nearly the identical melody with a 3rd, 5th, or 6th interval, but at bar 4 the flute begins to move from a quick staccato to a slower legato. Meanwhile, the bassoon plays a more danceable melody.</p>



<p>This section has the most triad changes, with the majority being B major, D# minor, F# major and G# minor.</p>



<p>This section ends with a VI &#8211; I, reintroducing the home triad and leading to the next triad.</p>



<p><strong>Section B</strong> Bars 10-20</p>



<p>The music here shifts to a more elaborate yet slower paced approach. The speed is reduced to 70 quaver beats per minute, and the notes are predominantly quavers. In bar 11, the flute plainly states that the key signature has changed to C# major.</p>



<p>The home triad, like the first section, is played right at the start to express the feeling of the new home triad. This time, I stuck with the home triad for a little longer than in&nbsp;the first section, with inversions of the triad lasting two bars and the primary motif repeated by the three instruments.</p>

<p>In contrast to the preceding section, this one contains a clearly defined chord progression: I &#8211; IV &#8211; iii &#8211; V.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="771" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-1024x771.png" alt="" class="wp-image-484" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-1024x771.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-300x226.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-768x578.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-1536x1156.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-2048x1541.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-640x482.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-960x722.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7.png 2222w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It ends with an I &#8211; IV, which leads to the next triad, that is expected to be the V: G# major.</p>



<p><strong>Section C</strong> Bars 21-40</p>



<p>Despite the fact that the tempo remains constant, I wanted the music to feel slower and more harmonized. As a result, I utilized a lot of crochets, minims, and semibreves.</p>



<p>This section is in the key of Ab major. I wanted it to be in G# major scale, but I learned that G# major isn&#8217;t commonly used because it&#8217;s too complex for practical use, and that Ab major is a better option.</p>



<p>In contrast to the other sections, I do not explicitly tell the listener of the key change. Though I begin with the Ab major triad, it isn&#8217;t until the third beat of the second bar of this section (bar 22) that I reach an Ab major triad.</p>



<p>In the final part of this section I wanted to express pure polyphony, with each instrument adding their own melody one at a time, culminating with all three instruments playing distinct melodies until they rise to end in Ab major triad.</p>

<p>Before I could listen to polyphonic music, I needed to define polyphony. There are three types of music textures: monophonic, homophonic, and polyphonic (Copland, Rich and Slatkin, 2011).</p>



<p>So far, I&#8217;ve largely studied monophonic music, which is music composed using a single tune. It does not imply that the music is limited to a single instrument or vocal. Monophonic music can feature percussion and many lines, but they all play the same melody at the same time.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s contemporary popular music is predominantly homophonic. It means that a principal melody is accompanied by a chordal accompaniment. Generally, it is more pleasant to hear than monophonic music because the harmony is played in a way that elevates the main melody.</p>



<p>Polyphony is more challenging than the preceding two. It occurs when two or more melodies happen at the same moment but are unrelated to one another. One of the most distinguishing characteristics of polyphony is that it is difficult to discern which melody is the primary one because each has its own prominence.</p>



<p>I was reminded of a pop tune that contains all three types of musical textures. Come On Eileen by Dexys Midnight Runners makes it simple to understand the three principles. The song begins with a single violin playing in a monophonic texture. The sound then shifts to a homophonic texture, primarily in the chorus. Finally, in the bridge portion, all voices join together in a polyphonic texture with up to three melodies, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Proceeding to my listening of polyphonic music, I decided that it will consist of as many listenings as there are melodies, plus one. To do this, I will try to listen to each melody separately and then all of them together in one final listening.</p>

<p>This is a polyphonic composition of music for four voices (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass), and it is one of the shortest English madrigals, published in 1594.</p>



<p>After a first listen, this music seems to me like a Christmas carol, despite the fact that there is nothing in the lyrics that leads in that direction except the &#8220;cold December&#8221; section. Speaking of the lyrics, this is not a cheerful love poem, and I believe the music reflects the protagonist&#8217;s disappointment.</p>



<p>The song starts with gentle rhythms but ascending melodic lines when describing April and June as metaphors for her beauty and the warmth of her eyes.</p>



<p>But as the song progresses towards the colder months, it becomes a little melancholy and deeper, with the vocals becoming lower in pitch and dynamics. September has lengthier notes and the melodies are more similar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-1024x905.png" alt="" class="wp-image-456" width="320" height="282" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-1024x905.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-300x265.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-768x679.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-640x566.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33-960x849.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-12.22.33.png 1054w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></figure>



<p>The most memorable section of the music occurs in December when the tune of &#8220;But in her heart&#8221; is repeated several times by all voices. This is foreshadowing the protagonist&#8217;s disappointment when he discovers she is as cold as December, and all voices get quieter and slower.</p>



<p>For me, the most exciting part is when the voices interact, and you can hear one voice starting at one point and another voice following up where the first left. This example below exemplifies how Thomas Morley considered this, employing quavers to interact amongst the voices, crotchets, and minims when the melodies are independent. This results in a lovely soundscape.</p>

<p>Although it is polyphonic music with individual melodies, there is some round counterpoint, as shown in the examples above and below. This can demonstrate that the composer is not limited to a single style.</p>

<p>Because this is a 40-part motet, I did not follow the guideline of listening to it as many times as there are voices. </p>



<p>It was written about 1570 by Thomas Tallis for eight choirs of five voices each and is regarded as the greatest piece of English early music by certain commentators.</p>



<p>Writing polyphonic compositions is a complex job for the composer and a demanding one for the listener who tries to follow each melody alone. This is especially true for music with more than three or four melodies, so one can only imagine how impressive it is to write for 40 voices and over 11 minutes. An example of Tallis&#8217;s incredible work can be seen in the example below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="691" height="1024" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-691x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-459" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-691x1024.png 691w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-202x300.png 202w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-768x1138.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-1037x1536.png 1037w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-300x445.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-640x948.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-960x1423.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52.png 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /></figure>



<p>Concentrating on individual melodies proved difficult in this situation, so I just listened to Spem in Alium as a whole choir song. I must add that it greatly surprised me and gave me a hypnotic sense due to the aural movements of the choirs. Though it is widely assumed that Tallis intended his choirs to be placed in a horseshoe form, I can only imagine how magnificent it would be to hear it live, with all eight choirs positioned in a circle around you, creating a 360º experience.</p>



<p>This piece, in my opinion, can be separated into three parts.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The first choir begins with just a few voices being formed together, then the other chorus joins them in turn. It almost sounds like a round.</li><li>Then, after a brief time when all 40 voices are singing together, we see an inverted movement from the opening section, in which the choirs follow each other in reverse order.</li><li>It is in the final section, which is more like a conversation between choirs, where this piece makes full use of its complexity, jumping between voices as it moves from choir to choir until it ends with all choirs singing together.</li></ul>



<p>Even though I didn&#8217;t find it boring, I thought the music was a bit longer than I would find interesting. Listening to it live would probably transmit the power and the spatial interactivity Tallis intended and keep it interesting for the whole 11 minutes of this piece.</p>



<h4 id="bach-prelude-and-fugue-no-17-in-ab-major-bwv-862">Bach: Prelude and Fugue No.17 in Ab major, BWV 862</h4>



<p>I was interested to listen how the polyphonic music developed from the renaissance era to the baroque. After reading some articles I found that Bach would be a great example of polyphonic baroque music, so I listened to a few of his fugues. The No.17 in Ab major was one the I liked most.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Richter plays Bach: WTC1 No. 17 in A flat major BWV 862" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gCL5Zvnt0TU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The polyphony of the late Baroque differed from that of the Renaissance: It was rooted in tonal harmony and characterized by an energetic, metrically conceived, driving rhythm (Hylton, 2005).</p>



<p>The start of the prelude really interested me because it was such a great way of opening a piece. It reminded me of some rock and heavy metal songs that start with triads in one guitar and a melody in another. </p>



<p>The theme of the prelude is repeated several times by both voices. Since polyphony can be hard to listen, this repetition of the main theme in one voice makes it sound familiar, while the other voice delivers a new and unexpected sound, making it fresh at the same time.</p>



<p>Even from the start is easy to find the differences from renaissance polyphony. More rhythm and more complexity. </p>



<p>Moving to the fugue, the new theme is clearly stated by repetition of the 4 voices, two in Ab major and two in Eb major.</p>



<p>I really like how the voices keep playing the main theme, specially when they rise for a perfect 4th or 5th as in the example below. It gives a really fresh and climatic tone to the music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="983" height="1024" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-983x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-500" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-983x1024.png 983w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-288x300.png 288w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-768x800.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-1474x1536.png 1474w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-1965x2048.png 1965w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-300x313.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-640x667.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-960x1000.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2.png 2165w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></figure>



<p>Also interesting is that in bar 11 starts a new melody that is repeated by three voices, separating by a perfect 5th and a perfect 4th. This adds again a freshness to the music, and Bach makes sure that although this piece is polyphonic and complex, there is always a familiar tune to be listened.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="962" height="1024" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-962x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-498" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-962x1024.png 962w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-282x300.png 282w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-768x818.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-1443x1536.png 1443w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-1924x2048.png 1924w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-300x319.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-640x681.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2-960x1022.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled2_0001-2.png 2165w" sizes="(max-width: 962px) 100vw, 962px" /></figure>

<p>I find this type of polyphony more interesting than the previous examples I listened, perhaps because I find that the complexity of notes and rhythms add more colour and interest to the piece.</p>



<h4 id="polyphony-of-dorze-people">Polyphony of Dorze People</h4>



<p>While researching polyphony, I came across this statement in the &#8216;Why do people sing?&#8217; book.</p>

<p>Therefore, I decided to listen to some polyphony singing from the Dorze tribe in Ethiopia to see and understand the main differences between them and western polyphony.</p>

<p>There are two songs on this recording that I listened to:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Ritual song by young boys</li><li>Spinning song by young girls</li></ul>



<p>The first one had a drone-like effect in one of the voices while the other voices sang a repeated theme. It&#8217;s a pretty rhythmic tune, but it&#8217;s also incredibly repetitive, with the same theme running throughout.</p>



<p>The second song appears to be a three-part polyphony, with one high-pitched solo melody, another group melody, and a low-pitched rhythmical melody. This one appears to be more sophisticated than the last one and more enjoyable to listen to.</p>



<p>The biggest difference between this song and the ones I previously evaluated is that each voice is sung with a specific function in mind, such as a rhythmic voice or a harmonising voice.</p>



<h4 id="tautai-taora-ofrai-leeward-islands"><meta charset="utf-8">Tautai Taora Ofrai (Leeward Islands)</h4>



<p>Little did I know that Polynesia was one of the first places on earth to develop polyphonic music. Europeans discovered Polynesia&#8217;s long tradition of polyphonic music in the 18th century. This discovery was a shocking one for European musicians, who believed that polyphony, as an attribute of a more advanced musical civilization, could have been only a product of the Christian monastery (Jordania, 2011).</p>



<p>This is one of the examples of recorded Polynesian polyphony.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>I got the same feeling after listening to Tautai Taora Ofrai as I did after listening to Dorze People&#8217;s polyphony. It&#8217;s a song with a lot of rhythms, but it&#8217;s also very repetitive.</p>



<p>Apart from that, I found this music to have a structure, with three parts separated by a drone from one of the voices.</p>



<p>Another difference I noticed between the two listenings is that there are more voices (at least four different melodies) and that they don&#8217;t appear to have a specific role, but rather their own melodies that are distinct from the other voices.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Finally, I&#8217;d want to share one anti-polyphony viewpoint that startled me. As in the video below, polyphony was described by Vincenzo Galilei as &#8220;a big mess of incoherent imperfections&#8221;. Despite the fact that I believe these statements to be harsh, I can see why Vicenzo Galilei wrote them. Polyphony is difficult to listen to and, if not properly done, can quickly devolve into a big mess.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The goal of this project was to create three different melodic lines that combined to make a little polyphony. The same triad chord should be used to begin and end the song.</p>



<p>I started with three flutes, as one of the coursework examples suggested, but after experimenting with different melodies, I realized the three voices would sound too similar, so I switched to a woodwind trio of Flute, Oboe, and Bassoon.</p>



<p>This little polyphony was written in a different way from the rest of my projects. I composed vertically, which means I worked on all three melodies at the same time, one bar at a time. I began by deciding on a key (G minor), then came up with a chord progression that I liked: Gm &#8211; Eb – Bb &#8211; Gm. With these factors in mind, I began each bar with the triads of each chord and designed the melodies in each bar to connect the triads.</p>



<p>This way of work was interesting since I didn&#8217;t have a sense of a final melody while I worked, but when I got to the end, I could clearly hear the many melodies. I then made some adjustments to ensure that the voices don&#8217;t clash when played simultaneously, particularly with the 2nd and 7th intervals, which sound dissonant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In this project, I was tasked with writing a descant for three of the five tunes provided. My decision was determined after listening to the five songs and selecting the three that I liked the best.</p>



<p>After doing some reading on Descants, I tried to incorporate what I learned into my exercises. I used counter-motion, tried to employ thirds and sixths most of the time, and kept the descant rhythmically distinct from the main theme. In addition, I added the descant above the melody.</p>

<p>The main melody made me think that it could be played by the bassoon since in my research I found that the bassoon isn&#8217;t stuck to playing low notes, but can play high notes as well. It then occurred to me I&#8217;d seen a video of Debussy&#8217;s La fille aux Cheveux de lin being performed by bassoon and harp. As a result, I wrote the descant for harp.</p>

<p>Even when the harp is played very quickly, it remains delicate and beautiful; therefore, I used quavers almost exclusively in contrast to the main melody crochets. In this piece, I used relatively little <meta charset="utf-8">contrary motion since I felt that the two instruments contrasted enough and sometimes they even completed each other, as you the example below.</p>

<p>I find the bassoon and oboe to be very celebratory instruments, as I explained before in my log. Because this tune sounded festive, I chose the oboe in contrast to the really high pitched piccolo. As I thought the piece needed some bass, I included the bass drum.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that both the descant and the main theme use quavers and semiquavers, I don&#8217;t think they clash, since I tried to respect the rhythm of each melody.</p>

<p>I chose this tune because I liked it, but I also knew it beforehand, so I tried to have fun. As the music always sounded like a church sound, I decided to go with the organ for the main theme and the choir to sing the descant.</p>



<p>For this exercise, I focused on the rhythmic differences of each tune, except for the finale, which I wanted to be memorable. Because of that, they both have the same rhythm, but they move in opposite directions.</p>

<p>With the descant, I had considerably more fun than I did with the rounds. The main difference is that melody is more about improvisation and novelty, opposite to the more structured thought processes of a round. However, I find that both methods help me get a better sense of vertical composition.</p>

<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Descant is a form of counterpoint, but usually is introduced after the melody is established and sang above the melody</li><li>Descants usually are written in the 3rd and 6th notes of the notes played by the melody</li><li>Although is not used in modern music, I believe it did not disappeared, just evolved</li></ul>



<p>My first step was to look up the definition of Descants. Merriam-Webster defines it as &#8220;a superimposed counterpoint to a simple melody sung typically by some or all of the sopranos&#8221;.</p>



<p>One of the definitions in The Oxford Dictionary of Music is &#8220;In modern hymn singing, a freely written or improvised soprano part added to a hymn tune while the tune itself is sung by the rest of the choir or by the congregation.&#8221; (Kennedy, Kennedy and Rutherford-Johnson, 2012).</p>



<p>In my own words, it occurs when composers introduce a melody over an already established tune and both perform flawlessly.</p>



<p>But one question arose: what is the difference between counterpoint and descant, given that both are melodies over melodies?</p>



<p>I struggled to find an answer to my question, but after some thought, I believe a descant is a type of counterpoint. However, there are two significant differences between regular and descant counterpoints:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>A descant is introduced&nbsp;when the melody has been well established, either via repetition or by being a popular melody, whereas conventional counterpoint can be used at any time. As a result, descants are frequently introduced near the end of a hymn, as as in ‘Hark! the Herald Angels Sing,&#8217; as shown below.</li><li>A descant is a melody that is placed above the melody by high-pitched singers or instruments (What is a… Descant?, 2021). A normal counterpoint can be placed either above or below the melody.</li></ul>



<p>The majority of the examples I discovered were from choral works. As a result, my listening will be primarily focused on two of these works.</p>

<p>The descant is only introduced in minute 2:16 of this Christmas carol, proving my claim that descants are introduced after the main melody is well established. One of the most fascinating aspects of the descant is illustrated in the image below. Both melodies have a contrary motion, so when one goes up, the other goes down. When they appear to clash (in the &#8220;of&#8221; passage), the descant descends to its lowest note, while the main melody ascends to its highest tone. This, together with the use of thirds and sixths, makes a nice contrast.</p>

<p>The descant appears at the end of the song, at the 2:46 mark. And with this song, I discovered another reason to create a descant: it can give the music an apotheotic ending, as I demonstrate below. Look at how the main melody is largely made up of crochets and only utilizes 5 notes, whereas the descant melody is mostly made up of quavers and uses 8 different notes in a descending &#8211; descending &#8211; ascending form. This gives the song a powerful ending.</p>

<p>Later, I came across this video in which one individual I couldn&#8217;t name, claims that the descant was a noble kind of art that is now extinct.</p>

<p>I would argue that if the descant is defined by an improvised line spoken over a known tune, it is not lost but rather moved from the vocal to the guitar. Guitar solos, in my opinion, are the modern equivalent of descant. I understand that this may offend some purist music theorists, but if you think of music as an evolving form of art, it makes sense.</p>



<p>Consider the Merriam-Webster definition (a superimposed counterpoint to a simple melody sung typically by some or all of the sopranos) and consider the guitar solo as a superimposed counterpoint over a simple melody, usually played by higher-pitched sounds and usually introduced after the main melody is established.</p>



<p>There are a million examples of guitar solos, improvised or not, over a melody, but I think the 1950s blues, when the electric guitar became popular, is one fantastic example of how the vocal descant transferred to the guitar solo, or should I say guitar descant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For this project, I had to write 4 perpetual rounds using the given triad progression as a starting point.</p>



<p>I began by looking at what are the guidelines for writing a perpetual round in order to prepare for this Rounds exercise. <a href="http://www.donaldsonworkshop.com/journal/Poesy/music/round/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.donaldsonworkshop.com/journal/Poesy/music/round/" target="_blank">This</a> and <a href="http://blog.mymusictheory.com/2014/how-to-compose-a-canon-or-round-easy-composition/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://blog.mymusictheory.com/2014/how-to-compose-a-canon-or-round-easy-composition/" target="_blank">this</a> website gave me some insight.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Specify how many bars you want before a second voice enters</li><li>Write a chord progression that spans that many bars. (I was given these in this project.)</li><li>Your melody line should be composed of notes from that chord progression, repeating it as many times as you want voices to appear in your round.</li><li>Include notes that were not in the chords, in order to make the melody more interesting.</li></ul>

<p>I didn&#8217;t particularly enjoy composing rounds, but I acknowledge that this project supported my learning since I can plainly see how this unit progresses from a single melody to counterpoint and harmony. The method I composed rounds was to make sure that all voices had chord notes in the beat. I tried to use notes from the scale in between beats to ensure that no notes collided in between voices. I didn&#8217;t include any instruments in my scores because my intention was to keep the rounds basic while still allowing for as many timbres as feasible.</p>

<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Use sounds other than traticional acoustic instruments to convey an atmosphere</li><li>Keep the melody interesting by beginning notes just before or after they should begin</li><li>Surprise the audience with key changes</li></ul>



<p>For me, Stevie Wonder is an acquired taste. I didn&#8217;t love his music as much when I was younger, but as I&#8217;ve gotten older, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate and admire how he created such beautiful songs.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that his album Songs In The Key Of Life is widely regarded as his masterpiece, one of his songs that I particularly enjoy listening to is Overjoyed. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot of literature devoted to describing how Stevie Wonder composed his songs, but I wanted to understand for myself why I appreciate this song so much and what composing talents he used to achieve such a wonderful sound.</p>



<p>Previous note: I will not study the lyrics because I am more interested in melody, harmony, and rhythm at the moment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Stevie Wonder - Overjoyed ((Live in Japan))" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11kOx3xcX-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The song begins with a piano and guitar accompanied by strange sounds. Stevie Wonder refers to it as Environmental Percussion, and it consists of natural noises such as birds, crushed leaves, and stones dropped in a pond (Harrington, 1985). In fact, these water drops can be found throughout the song in the backbeat.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell which key the music starts in since it goes from C# Major 6 to C7 to B Major 7 and then back to C7. It repeats once again, but instead of going up in the last chord, it goes down to Bb.</p>



<p>This intro is such an odd way to begin a song because it doesn&#8217;t really inform you what to anticipate. When the line is descending, the listener expects it to continue descending, but the chords rise, and when it repeats, the expectation is that it will rise in the last chord, but it continues to descend. This up and down uncertainty, as well as the sounds of nature, distinguishes this song from many others.</p>



<p>When the verse begins, the chords and voice shift to Eb, the song&#8217;s key. The final Bb chord of the intro now makes sense because it is the dominant of the Eb.</p>



<p>The verse is an I-vi-ii-V progression, which is quite common, and the vocal melody is also quite simple. With such an odd beginning, you wouldn&#8217;t expect such a straightforward but wonderful verse.</p>



<p>One thing I realized is that if you listen closely to Steve&#8217;s vocal melody, he begins slightly before the rhythm, as shown in the example below. This syncopation is a subtle but crucial rhythm decision in my opinion. It appears that the singer is propelling the music ahead with vowels rather than consonants, as one might expect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="120" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1024x120.png" alt="" class="wp-image-402" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1024x120.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-300x35.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-768x90.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1536x180.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-2048x239.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-640x75.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-960x112.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When there is a repetition, Stevie Wonder goes to unexpected places, as he did in the intro. When the listener expects an ii (F minor) in the I-vi-ii-V progression in the second part of the verse, the music modulates to a C major scale, and the chords go to an F major 7 and then to a G major 7, and the B part of the verse begins in C major.</p>



<p>This game of not giving the listener what he expects is not new, but it works marvellously when it is effectively crafted.</p>



<p>When the listener expects a repetition in this B section of the verse, the music moves to another area. In this case, we expect to stay in the major key, but the third chord is a C minor, so the key shifts to a minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="441" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1024x441.png" alt="" class="wp-image-403" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1024x441.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-300x129.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-768x331.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1536x661.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-2048x882.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-640x276.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-960x413.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Following the verse, the melody gracefully transitions to the chorus, with a chromatic rise to a new chord: Ab Major. The melody drops through G &#8211; F &#8211; Eb &#8211; D, which is on the Eb major scale, so I don&#8217;t believe the music modulates to a new key signature.</p>



<p>This chorus is particularly fascinating since the chords he uses to advance to the chorus are also used to decrease in the chorus. That&#8217;s intriguing because Stevie Wonder, once again, plays with the listener&#8217;s expectations. He went up with Bb &#8211; C -D &#8211; Eb &#8211; F -G then down with G &#8211; F &#8211; Eb &#8211; D, therefore the following note should be C, but instead, he changes the chorus to C#. It&#8217;s only for a moment, but it&#8217;s a pleasant surprise. But the surprise doesn&#8217;t stop there; the chorus modulates to a new key a whole tone above, creating a fantastic climax.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="603" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1024x603.png" alt="" class="wp-image-406" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1024x603.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-300x177.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-768x453.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1536x905.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-2048x1207.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-640x377.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-960x566.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The song returns to the intro and the verse, but when the music moves to the chorus again, the melody begins in the A (just as it did in the second chorus). At this point, the listener may wonder if the chorus can get any higher. It does. Again, we modulate to a whole tone above, reaching the peak of the song.</p>



<p>As expected, the song culminates with the root note Eb after the chorus. There are no surprises at the end of the song.</p>



<p>I knew this song was beautifully crafted even before I analyzed it, but I had no idea it had so many details like the water sound, the syncopation in the verse, or the major/minor key modulations. I genuinely believe that this analysis helped me understand how to keep a song engaging without making it appear overly difficult.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A round is a musical composition in the form of a canon, and the melody is constructed in a way that produces a counterpoint when various performers or instruments begin it at different times. It is known as a &#8220;perpetual canon&#8221; since its ending works along with the opening.</p>



<p>I listened to dozens of rounds because they are typically easy and fun to listen to. I chose a few that appealed to me the most.</p>



<h3 id="the-great-bells-of-oseney">The Great Bells of Oseney</h3>



<p>This is a three-part round from 1609, but I couldn&#8217;t discover any further information about it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/deut9.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This is a pretty simple round, but it&#8217;s useful to understand how three voices are used to produce triads most of the time, particularly in the first and end beats.</p>

<p>A three-part round in Hebrew from the 15th century that is frequently assigned to Johannes Ockeghem, despite the lack of strong evidence of that.</p>

<p>The intriguing aspect of this round is that all voices have the identical note durations in the first two bars, resulting in a tremendous harmonizing sound. This pattern is disrupted in the third and fourth bars by the introduction of quavers, which creates a nice surprise.</p>

<p>A three-part round in the minor key that dates back to at least 1609.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/heyhonobody.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Typically, rounds are amusing or joyous songs, but this one is a lament sung in the D Minor scale. In contrast to the other rounds, this one employs a lot of quavers in between the chords, resulting in a more nuanced music. Another intriguing element is that the melody ends in the supertonic rather than the tonic, producing a sense of incompleteness and perpetualness.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="307" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-1024x307.png" alt="" class="wp-image-383" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-1024x307.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-300x90.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-768x231.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-640x192.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-960x288.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody.png 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>This is a popular Latin three-part round that is frequently assigned to Palestrina, however some contend that it was written by Mozart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/donanobis.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>What strikes me the most about this round is that, except the first two bars, all voices are really close together. They even end all three on the same note. When sang collectively, I believe this produces a more powerful sound, but I don&#8217;t believe the listener can follow the voices independently, which is one of the most interesting things in rounds.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="317" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-1024x317.png" alt="" class="wp-image-384" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-1024x317.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-300x93.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-768x238.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-640x198.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-960x298.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34.png 1258w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>This is a quick four-part round from 1609.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/joanglover.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>What I found remarkable about this round is the rhythm that all four voices repeat, almost always employing the triad. I think it&#8217;s incredibly danceable, and when sung in a group, it may make for a very energetic round.</p>

<p>I was curious to hear a Mozart round, and I loved how he employed the Minims and crochets to keep the bass notes sustained. When listening to the melody with just one voice, it&#8217;s difficult to tell if there&#8217;s a top melody and a bass background, but when all voices are heard combined, it&#8217;s clear that there is.</p>

<p>Of course, I couldn&#8217;t leave Henry Purcell out of this round (pun intended).</p>

<p>My favorite Purcell round was this one, which was humourous in style and delightful in how the voices sang &#8220;so kiss my arse&#8221; properly, accentuating each note with great force and confidence.</p>

<p>Although the majority of the examples I listened to were made more than a century ago, I remembered two instances from recent music that demonstrate that rounds are alive and well and may be employed in a modern context.</p>



<p>The most well-known is the final section of The Beach Boys&#8217; &#8211; God only knows. I recently watched Paul Mccartney&#8217;s documentary &#8220;McCartney 3, 2, 1,&#8221; in which he admits that Brian Wilson is one of his favorite harmony composers, and you can tell that this round is quite well composed.</p>

<p>Another song from the musical Rent that came to mind is &#8220;Will I?&#8221; from the musical Rent. Musicals, in my opinion, are a terrific platform for writing rounds because you can work with different vocal tones, portrayed by different characters, and so create a highly dynamic song.</p>
