										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The goal of this final project, which comes before the first assignment, is to create a plan for the assignment composition, which should last between 2 and 3 minutes and begin with the specified composition.</p>



<p>One thing I noticed is that it is suggested that the plan begins with the structure before deciding on the content. However, when I look at Assignment 1, I find that it begins with a group of demons entering the scene. As a result, I&#8217;m reluctant to separate the idea from the structure. So I decided to start with the idea/story and then go on to the structure.</p>



<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>



<p>When I first read &#8220;Curtain Rises, enter a group of demons&#8221; at the start of assignment 1, I immediately thought of the devils that pop into your head from time to time. Particularly when you&#8217;re going to do something that makes you feel uneasy. For example, for me, it was when I began writing music in notation, which I had never done before. All of your demons begin to rush through your head in the form of doubts such as &#8220;will I be able to do this?&#8221; and &#8220;why did I even start this course?&#8221;</p>



<p>For this piece, I decided to explore the battle between spirits (doubts, anxieties, self-censorship) and demons (confidence, tranquillity, wisdom) that happen inside your head when you&#8217;re about to do something uncomfortable.</p>



<h2 id="the-structure">The Structure</h2>



<p>Starting with the given Wild Dance composition, I opted to utilize the specified tempo (153 bpm) as the demons tempo since it conveys a sense of haste and chaos. By contrast, the angels will move at a slower pace, conveying a sense of tranquillity. </p>



<p>As I previously stated, my composition will be about a clash&nbsp;in which demons arrive and attack, angels defend, demons counter-attack and the angels ultimately triumph. I want the audience to sense this conflict, which will be reflected in the speed and instrument shifts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular cnvs-block-core-table-1628498574118"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A &#8211; A horde of demons appear on stage, dancing around the angels and provoking them. The angels are standing calmly nearby.</td><td>Principal</td><td>~30 seconds at 153 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>B &#8211; The demons strike with hesitation, insecurity, and anxiety.</td><td>Principal</td><td>~40 seconds at 153 bpm</td></tr><tr><td>C- The angels continue to live in peace. They are composed, self-assured, and wise. They don&#8217;t desire war, so they demonstrate this by dancing slowly and peacefully.</td><td>Subsidiary</td><td>~40 seconds at 85 bpm</td></tr><tr><td>B&#8217;-The demons retaliate, but they&#8217;re growing nervous.</td><td>Reprise</td><td>~20 seconds at 153 bpm</td></tr><tr><td>C&#8217;-The angels grow in strength and distance themselves from the demons.</td><td>Closing</td><td>~20 seconds at 153 bpm</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="the-motifs">The motifs</h2>



<p>I developed some themes for each section. The first one will serve as an introduction and the example is already delivered, which heavily uses the tambourine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39.png" alt="" class="wp-image-188" width="270" height="336" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39.png 500w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39-241x300.png 241w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39-300x373.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /></figure>



<p>In the B section, I imagined the demons&#8217; strike to be powerful, but with a slight hesitation at the end.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31.png" alt="" class="wp-image-189" width="277" height="346" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31.png 508w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31-240x300.png 240w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31-300x374.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></figure>



<p>The angels in the C portion are calm, assertive, and peaceful. It will contrast with the prior two motifs&#8217; warlike snare.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45.png" alt="" class="wp-image-190" width="281" height="323" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45.png 514w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45-261x300.png 261w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45-300x344.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /></figure>



<h2 id="the-instruments">The instruments</h2>



<p>For the demons parts, I chose the given instruments (Bass Drum, Snare Drum, Tambourine, Cymbal) because I believe they convey the sense of urgency and aggression I want to portray. In addition to the Bass Drum, a rhythmic instrument, the angels will also use the Bongos, Cabasa, and Finger Cymbals.</p>



<p>For simplicity, I retained four instruments for each part, and since I want it to be played by four musicians, they only have to switch between two instruments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This project&#8217;s goal is to create two studies using at least three untuned percussion instruments. Despite the fact that I could have used some of the examples provided as a starting point for my work, I chose to build them from scratch.</p>



<p>While I thought using more instruments would be easier, the variety of instruments available and the techniques for each instrument were overwhelming. I often worked on a single instrument and then realized it didn&#8217;t fit well with the others, forcing me to rewrite it. That took longer than I anticipated.</p>



<p>A characteristic that I noticed about some of the percussion compositions I listened to is that they are coupled with dance or body movements. Therefore, the central focus of both of my studies is on expressive dance and bodily movement.</p>



<h2 id="study-1">Study 1</h2>



<p>My professional background is in advertising, and as I started thinking about this first research, I remembered an old Lacoste commercial called The Leap. This video shows a couple sitting at a coffee table, with the boy preparing to kiss the girl for the first time. The film then turns to a metaphor for what&#8217;s going on inside his head: a massive leap into the unknown. I immediately thought of my <a href="https://pedrovintem.000webhostapp.com/2021/07/project-1-percussion-solos" target="_blank">first study of Taiko</a> and how it is linked to breathing rhythm. Due to this, I chose the video and the Taiko as the basis for my initial study.</p>



<p>I decided Taiko was the foundation of this composition, the heart, and then I added instruments that I thought might be able to bring the breath rhythm to life. Wood Blocks first function as an echo of the heart (Taiko) and then as the rush of the mind. The snare brings a marching strength that reminds me of running. The tam-tam is used as a reminder of the character&#8217;s great action&#8217;s danger. Cabasas are merely used to cause confusion and dizziness.</p>



<p>When I was looking for information on instrument techniques, I came upon <a href="https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/instruments/percussion/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/instruments/percussion/" target="_blank">Philharmonia&#8217;s excellent webpage</a> on percussion instruments. There, I examined the tam-tam and one unique technique in which the musician rubs a triangular stick against the tam-tam&#8217;s edge&nbsp;to produce a harsh sound. If the player rubbed it gently enough, it could simulate the sound of the wind.</p>



<p>There are three parts to this piece:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The acceleration of breathing</li><li>The suspension of jumping</li><li>The unpredictability of the first kiss</li></ul>



<p>As much as possible, I tried to make it concise and interesting while staying true to the main idea. My 3rd section used a time change from 5/4 to 3/4 in order to help create some confusion. The ending was inspired by my first <a href="https://pedrovintem.000webhostapp.com/2021/06/listening-to-arthur-honegger-cello-sonata-h-20-iii-presto" target="_blank">listening of Honegger</a>, with the ending feeling incomplete (just like every first kiss, you want more from the moment) in a 4/4 bar rather than a 5/4 bar.</p>

<h2 id="study-2">Study 2</h2>



<p>This study was inspired by flamenco dances I watched as a kid. There were times when a male and female dancer alternated. The idea behind this song is to create a classic storyline in which a girl meets a boy and in the end, they dance together.</p>



<p>I have divided this piece into three parts:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The girl is introduced</li><li>The boy is introduced</li><li>They both dance together</li></ul>



<p>I attempted to use some Latin instruments, but because some of them were unfamiliar to me, I had to do some additional research into their techniques.</p>



<p>The Cajon and Tambourine offer the rhythm&#8217;s foundation. I looked at Vic Firth&#8217;s tutorials for the tambourine, particularly the usage of the thumb roll as a gentle and long roll that could fit this rhythm. Because I couldn&#8217;t find a standardized method to notate the Cajon, I created a two-line stave with the low strokes on the bottom line and the high strokes on the top line.</p>



<p>The girl is represented by the Castanets and the Guiro. For me, the Guiro was a whole new instrument. After seeing and listening to Guiro rhythms, I decided to keep it basic and only provide some context for the Castanets.</p>



<p>Bongos and Claves symbolize the boy. Cajon&#8217;s low pitch led me to choose Bongos instead of Congas since they are higher pitched. It is written in two-line Bongo notation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Composing for two instruments should have been easy for me, but it turned out to be more difficult.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Composing for two instruments should have been easy for me, but it turned out to be more difficult. Beyond the obvious snare and bass drum, I had a hard time deciding which instruments should make a duet. Then I had difficulties getting it to function beyond the basic concept; I constantly felt like one instrument was missing.</p>



<p>The purpose of this project is to write four short compositions with at least eight bars each for two untuned instruments. The conversation between the instruments should be explored in the first two parts. The latter two should experiment with unusual time signatures &#8211; five and seven beats per bar, respectively.</p>



<h2 id="snare-drum-bass-drum">Snare Drum &amp; Bass Drum</h2>



<p>For the first study, I chose the one that was most comfortable for me. I&#8217;m familiar with the snare and bass drum&#8217;s characteristics, so I sought to create a piece that would explore a dialogue between the two. The goal is for each participant to &#8220;talk&#8221; in turn until they are both in unison. The second section of this composition was inspired by a scene from Carmen Suite (that I reviewed <a href="https://pedrovintem.000webhostapp.com/2021/07/listening-to-rodion-shchedrin-carmen-suite" target="_blank">here</a>), in which the Marimba and Vibrafono had a little dialogue.</p>

<h2 id="shaker-wood-block">Shaker &amp; Wood Block</h2>



<p>In this work, I had a concept of a conversation, but it&#8217;s one of those where one side does the majority of the talking while the other simply attempts to say something but finds it nearly impossible and eventually becomes frustrated. If I&#8217;m being frank, I think the shaker can be irritating if used frequently. I discovered George Crumb&#8217;s Music For a Summer Evening when researching the shaker. The use of the shaker piqued my interest, and it led me to conclude the conversation in bar 7.</p>

<h2 id="castanets-tambourine">Castanets &amp; Tambourine</h2>



<p>When I was listening to Carmen Suite, I noticed how the castanets were used to create a more danceable rhythm. I looked into what approaches could be used in the castanets for my third composition, but in the end, the flamenco dancers who hit their shoes on the floor to mark the rhythm inspired me more.</p>

<h2 id="triangle-cymbal">Triangle &amp; Cymbal</h2>



<p>With the last one, I wanted to go darker. In my perspective, the cymbal has either a massive marking when struck hard or a mystery marking when slammed softly. After seeing Vic Firth&#8217;s video with the suspended cymbal, I decided to use the Marimba Mallet&#8217;s deeper tone. However, because it is preferable to describe the desired sound rather than the mallet (Solomon, 2002), I put &#8220;dark.&#8221;</p>

</h2>



<p>Composing exclusively for percussion is something new for me. In fact, composing in notation is also a first for me. Usually, I just sit at the piano and compose. I believe that creating in this way took me longer, but that time allowed me to go deeper into the instruments and better understand what I could do with them.</p>



<p>The lack of a standard for notating percussion instruments was the first hurdle I faced (Black and Gerou, 2005). As a result, to have a consistent notation, I used the Essential Dictionary of Orchestration. Also, because some percussion instruments have little or no natural resonance, I chose to change the note-length in order to have fewer rests, which keeps the piece from becoming cluttered and difficult to read (Solomon, 2002). </p>



<p>The&nbsp;goal&nbsp;for&nbsp;this&nbsp;project&nbsp;was&nbsp;to&nbsp;compose&nbsp;four&nbsp;short&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;for&nbsp;untuned&nbsp;instruments&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;choice. I chose the Triangle, the Snare Drum, the Taiko and the Tambourine.</p>



<h2 id="the-triangle" class="has-huge-font-size">The Triangle</h2>



<p>Because this is my first time composing for percussion, I chose to work with the triangle. Eric Hopes wrote it best when he said: &#8220;The truth is that anyone can play the triangle. It is one of the most basic musical instruments.&#8221; (How to Be a Professional Triangle Player | Musicians of the Utah Symphony, n.d.). To test it out, I started writing in a simple time signature, and it sounded good. A section of this work was influenced by Antonín Dvořák&#8217;s Symphony No. 9 in E minor (3rd movement), of which I discovered a performance of the triangle on Youtube.</p>

<h2 id="the-snare-drum" class="has-huge-font-size">The Snare Drum</h2>



<p>For me, the snare drum was an obvious option because it is the percussion instrument with which I am most familiar. Chop Suey! by System Of A Down began playing on my Spotify while I was composing this piece. I interpreted it as both a divine sign and a challenge. Could this song&#8217;s verse serve as inspiration for a snare solo? Yes, I believe so.</p>

<h2 id="the-taiko" class="has-huge-font-size">The Taiko</h2>



<p>Because I knew nothing about this instrument, I did some research and discovered the principle of &#8220;breath rhythm,&#8221; in which a piece&#8217;s metrical markers are sensed and played as the rhythm of breath (Powell, 2012). This inspired me to set the tempo to 64 because an adult breath rhythm is around 16 breaths per minute, multiplied by four equals 64. This piece, I believe, can translate your breathing before doing something exciting, such as fighting in a war or kissing someone for the first time. Your breathing quickens, you hold your breath for a brief moment, and then it&#8217;s all adrenaline.</p>

<h2 id="the-tambourine" class="has-huge-font-size">The Tambourine</h2>



<p>For me, this was not an obvious choice. I&#8217;d never given the tambourine much thought before, but when I was looking for instruments, I came across Edoardo Giachino&#8217;s video of him playing it and was inspired to use it in this project.</p>

<p>What I like about the tambourine is that it reminds me of Spanish/Latin sounds that I&#8217;m familiar with. Particularly in Bizet&#8217;s Carmen, which I may review later in my listening log. I attempted to create some fanfare in this piece. Fanfares are typically performed for brass or brass and percussion instruments (Florek, 2015), so I figured why not a tambourine fanfare?</p>
