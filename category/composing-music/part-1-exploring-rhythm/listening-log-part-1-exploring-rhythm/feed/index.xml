<p>The backstory surrounding the Toccata is fascinating. Carlos Chávez was commissioned by John Cage to create a piece for the percussion ensemble with which he was travelling. As a result, the <meta charset="utf-8">Toccata for Percussion was created. The sad part is that <meta charset="utf-8">Cage&#8217;s ensemble was unable to execute the opening movement, which requires all members to play long, continuous drum rolls, and the piece was never played. The Toccata was not performed until 1948 (Hall, 2008).</p>



<p>The moral of this story, in my opinion, is that there is a fine line between what the composer wants and what the players are capable of playing. In my compositions, I&#8217;ll try to keep this in mind.</p>



<p>This is a three-movement work composed entirely of percussion instruments, the majority of which are unpitched (or indefinite-pitched). I was expecting Latin percussion instruments, but, with the exception of the Indian Drum, all of the other instruments are standard orchestral instruments, not exotic ones.</p>



<p>After a first listen, I discovered that Chávez divided the piece into Membranes and Metalic instruments, with a few wooden instruments thrown in the mix. The wooden instruments, I believe, are used for melody and the other for rhythm.</p>



<p>In terms of the first movement, I found it to be highly interactive. Instruments can be heard playing the passing theme at different times. Other times, as in the example below, the sound shifts from low to high pitch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="448" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-1024x448.png" alt="" class="wp-image-218" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-1024x448.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-300x131.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-768x336.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-1536x671.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-2048x895.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-640x280.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59-960x420.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-11.58.59.png 2558w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This first movement is characterized by the eight notes, that create some of the motifs of this part.</p>



<p>When I got to the end of this movement, I realized it ended the same way it started: with a roll. Actually, rolls are present in all music and may be the Toccata&#8217;s most prominent feature. When I got to the end of the movement, I realized it ended with a roll, just like it had begun.  Because Chávez wrote these final rolls without diminuendo, I believe it will be difficult for players to keep the roll while changing the strength of strokes at the same time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="469" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-1024x469.png" alt="" class="wp-image-220" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-1024x469.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-300x138.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-768x352.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-1536x704.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-2048x939.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-640x293.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-960x440.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19.png 2452w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>With the exception of the xylophone, the instruments in the second movement are all metallic. This movement seemed more mysterious to me, perhaps because of the sound of the metallic instruments and the slower tempo. But, thanks to the xylophone and glockenspiel, it&#8217;s also the most melodic of the movements. I found it particularly fascinating when all of the instruments imitated one another, resulting in a unique timbre.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-991x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-219" width="423" height="437" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-991x1024.png 991w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-290x300.png 290w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-768x794.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-300x310.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-640x661.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-960x992.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25.png 1318w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /></figure>



<p>The third movement is more complex, and I finally found the Latin rhythms I was looking for at the beginning. We return to membrane instruments in this movement, with the glockenspiel, maracas, and claves added later. This movement appears to use more sixteenth notes than the previous ones, making it feel faster. The third movement continues to be interactive, with some instruments passing the motif from one instrument to the next, like the example below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="450" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-1024x450.png" alt="" class="wp-image-221" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-1024x450.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-300x132.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-768x338.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-1536x675.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-2048x900.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-640x281.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36-960x422.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-13.30.36.png 2548w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>On a personal note, I found the Toccata for Percussion to be a fascinating composition in which I was able to acquire a feel of how different percussion instruments may be used to convey both rhythm and melody.</p>

		<span>Variations, rhythm and all that jazz.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>I listened to all 16 variations from Boris Blacher&#8217;s Variations On A Paganini Theme, but I was curious how it sounded and looked in a concert, so I watched a performance by the Frankfurt Radio Symphony.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Blacher: Paganini-Variationen ∙ hr-Sinfonieorchester ∙ Andrés Orozco-Estrada" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l8GVvL-wW8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The Paganini Caprice theme fades away after a few seconds, and Blacher&#8217;s variants come to life on their own. There&#8217;s a little resemblance to it now and then, but it&#8217;s really subtle. Another thing I noticed is that Blacher strives to showcase all instruments through the variations, starting with strings, then on to woodwinds, and finally to brass. Percussion continues to come and go as the variants change. Despite the fact that I believe most of the variants to be quite vibrant rhythmically, there is no variation dedicated only to percussion.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a score, and despite the fact that different time signatures were used between variations, I couldn&#8217;t figure out if Variable Metre was used at all.</p>



<p>For me, the second&nbsp;and last two&nbsp;variations were the most intriguing. The second variation features a bluesy oboe with blue notes, which I adore (and it looks like the player from the performance I posted does too). The 15th and 16th have a jazzier flavour to them, and they remind me of big bands. That was a fantastic conclusion. &#8220;Dominant rhythm and abrupt ends are Blacher hallmarks,&#8221; (Simon, 2003) I realized after learning more about Blacher.</p>



<p>All of this jazz influence, and how he changed it into an orchestral sound, piqued my curiosity in Blacher, and I&#8217;m likely to listen to him more in the future, and perhaps include some of his influences into my works.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Side Note about Variations. I had no clue what variations were, let alone how popular Paganini&#8217;s theme was. Basically, variation form is when you take a song&#8217;s theme and investigate, mine, twist, and transform it into a new piece of art (Hough, 2013). It appears to me to be a creative exercise rather than the construction of completely new work. I enjoy the idea of variations, and I&#8217;m curious as to why there aren&#8217;t any big musicians that do variations of other artists&#8217; songs. This reminds me that some DJs are experimenting with several versions of the same song like Stereossauro did with Carlos Paredes&#8217; Verdes Anos.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s amusing that a quick Google search for [Variable Metre Boris Blacher] yields nearly exclusively results from OCA&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s amusing that a quick Google search for [Variable Metre Boris Blacher] yields nearly exclusively results from OCA students&#8217; blogs. Are we the only ones who have written on Variable Metre?</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not going to provide an entire biography of Boris Blacher here (an excellent summary can be found in Simon, 2003), but I did discover that he studied architecture before becoming a renowned composer. Probably that is why he developed the Variable Metre, which is made up of &#8220;patterns, certainly, but used as expressive building blocks&#8221; (Matthew-Walker 2003, p.24).</p>



<p>But first, let&#8217;s look at the formal definition of Variable Metre from The Oxford Dictionary of Music:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">[a rhythmical process] whereby systematic changes of metre are planned according to mathematical relationships.</p><cite>(Kennedy, Kennedy and Rutherford-Johnson, 2013)</cite></blockquote>



<p>I believe that it is simpler to say that Variable Metre is when a piece of music with a continual shift in time signature based on a numeric pattern. This pattern can have a mathematical relationship, but I don&#8217;t believe it is always true. It&#8217;s also easier to understand if you look at it:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1fZQ6vsTcWMsSif1J3uHEMJGXZ2JLKa2I" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Numbers below the tempo marker indicate the time signature, while dots indicate incremental changes to the next value.</p>



<p>Although some sources claim he did not invent Variable Metre (Quinn, 2005), he was most likely the one who developed it most.</p>



<p>I must admit that when I initially read the definition of Variable Metre, I was sceptical about whether or not I would enjoy hearing it. I agreed with critics who claimed that this method was more like eye-music than ear-music (Matthew-Walker 2003, p.24). My opinion changed when I heard his Piano Concerto No.2.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Boris Blacher - Piano Concerto No.2 Op.42" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/00QddeqyE5U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>After hearing it multiple times and assessing which sections I loved the most and which parts I didn&#8217;t believe Variable Metre made a significant difference, I realized that this technique works best when the notes are&nbsp;repeated. In Konzert für Klavier und Orchester, No. 2: I. Allegro, this happens. You&#8217;re listening to the same thing over and over, but each time the time changes, a new puzzle piece is added. As if a block is being added to a building to make it more stunning. This enables the creation of anticipation and disruption. I believe these two qualities are&nbsp;appealing to the ear.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I believe it was worthwhile to learn about Variable Metre, but I find it difficult to think of it as anything more than a creative exercise if it is not utilized with repetition.</p>

<p>A little backstory. When Shchedrin&#8217;s wife, Maya Plisetskaya, asked Shostakovich to write a new Carmen ballet, he &#8220;gently but firmly refused.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of Bizet.&#8221; After that, she asked her husband, who agreed. Shostakovich&#8217;s response demonstrates Shchedrin&#8217;s bravery. After its debut performance, the Carmen Suite was deemed &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; to Bizet&#8217;s opera and was banned by the Soviet leadership. (Plisetskaya, 2001)</p>



<p>I feel that percussion, such as tubular bells, cymbals and castanets, are used throughout Shchedrin&#8217;s score to emphasize rhythms. Although he pays homage to the original material, he frequently pushes the music in unexpected ways, heightening the atmosphere and drama.</p>



<p>On&nbsp;the&nbsp;other&nbsp;side,&nbsp;I&nbsp;find&nbsp;the&nbsp;presence&nbsp;of&nbsp;percussion&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rather&nbsp;comic&nbsp;at&nbsp;times, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;timpani&nbsp;glissando&nbsp;is&nbsp;used&nbsp;or&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;strings&nbsp;provide&nbsp;distinctive&nbsp;effects. </p>



<p>Overall, I think the experiment of using percussion to replace other instruments was a great success, and the end result was quite entertaining. If it&#8217;s superior to the original? I don&#8217;t believe it is necessary to respond.</p>



<p>It reminded me of Johnny Cash&#8217;s Hurt version. It was a risky move for producer Rick Rubin to persuade Johnny Cash to record a version of Nine Inch Nail&#8217;s Hurt. Cash refused to sing the song, which was widely regarded as one of NIN&#8217;s best. It wasn&#8217;t until he read the lyrics that Cash realized he could make his own version of the song. Finally, the singer and producer managed to create a masterpiece from a masterpiece. It wasn&#8217;t better or worse than the original; rather, it was unique. Instead of being a song about drugs and self-destruction, they transformed it into an acoustic song about the epilogue of an eventful life.</p>

<p>Like NIN/Cash&#8217;s Hurt, Bizet/Shchedrin&#8217;s Carmen can exist in the music world indefinitely as two different but interconnected works that don&#8217;t have to be judged against each other.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As I was working on project 1, System Of A Down&#8217;s Chop Suey! began playing on my Spotify. Although I have always enjoyed this song, I never paid close attention to it.</p>



<p>Chop Suey! is the first single from the Los Angeles band&#8217;s second studio album, Toxicity, it&#8217;s one of the most recognizable songs in the Nu-Metal genre and it was voted the greatest metal song of the 21st century by Metal Hammer magazine (Metal Hammer, 2021).</p>



<p>While System Of A Down is an American heavy metal band, all of its members are of Armenian descent, being either the children of Armenian immigrants or immigrants themselves from Armenia. This contributes to the novel sound that they brought to the Heavy Metal scene, which is especially apparent in Chop Suey!.</p>

<p>One reason this song is so enjoyable is that it is both familiar and experimental at the same time. “It has this very experimental side that wasn’t like anything the radio was playing at the time, but also a really melodic side that really caught people,” says the band&#8217;s guitarist Daron Malakian (Everley, 2021).</p>



<p>Initially, we hear an acoustic guitar with a danceable rhythm, followed by bass and drums. The intro leads to the heavy part with heavily distorted electric guitar and open hi-hats on the drums. After that, the novel part begins.</p>



<p>The voice, guitar, bass, and drums are all unified in the verse. They all have the same rhythm, the same rests, and the same notes. It&#8217;s confusing, unexpected, and a nod to rap music. For me, this is the most memorable part of the song because it is almost like a staccato in a heavy metal song.</p>



<p>After the verse, the song moves flawlessly to the chorus. This is a melodic and calm part. The two voices are in harmony, the guitar is playing a simpler arpeggio and the drums are just sustaining the rhythm. This is another interesting take on this song, because instead of the chorus being the climax and the most memorable part of the song, as it usually is, here is the relaxing part that makes a bridge between the chaotic verse.</p>



<p>The song repeats the pre-verse riff, then the verse and chorus again before moving to the bridge. Here, the chaos returns with the distorted guitars and intense drums is combined with a new melody sung by Gregorian chant-like harmonies. Once again, an unexpecting twist makes this song even more memorable.</p>



<p>The bridge moves almost unnoticeably to the chorus but with few changes in melody and in the guitar, keeping it fresh but familiar at the same time until the end of the song.</p>

<p>My&nbsp;first&nbsp;listening&nbsp;log&nbsp;was&nbsp;an&nbsp;assignment&nbsp;in&nbsp;which&nbsp;I&nbsp;was&nbsp;given&nbsp;a&nbsp;list&nbsp;of&nbsp;composers&nbsp;to choose&nbsp;from. I chose Honegger because I have never listened to him before. I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>



<p>I listened to Cello Sonata, H.20 and I was surprised when the III. Presto started. The music starts with a sharp cello that immediately took me to Tango sounds. I was not expecting that. But that feeling lasted for a second because the music immediately takes a rhythm that is nothing like Tango. It goes with a very paced rhythm, almost mechanical, marked by the cello and followed by the piano. Then, is the piano that marks the rhythm. For me, this is done in a very subtle but interesting way. </p>



<p>The music becomes more melodious toward the finish, and it appears that it is becoming calmer, but I believe Honegger is deceiving us. The mechanical rhythm is constant, and the apotheosis is approaching until it abruptly ends. Instead of ending in a D, as you might expect, the cello and piano end a B and a B#, respectively. That was incredible.</p>



<p>Another thing I found fascinating was listening to multiple musicians perform this piece and seeing how they approached the finish in quite different ways. Some clearly marked it, indicating that it had come to an end. Others failed to create the surprise that Honegger envisioned. But, in my perspective, Bertsch and Webber did an excellent job.</p>



<p>One last thought.</p>



<p>Because my mind was still expecting a finish, this finale remained stuck in my thoughts. The&nbsp;thing&nbsp;is,&nbsp;you&#8217;ve&nbsp;been&nbsp;rushing&nbsp;somewhere&nbsp;for&nbsp;more&nbsp;than&nbsp;3&nbsp;minutes,&nbsp;but&nbsp;you&#8217;ve&nbsp;arrived&nbsp;nowhere. Is this song about life? About being born in an instant, living your life at full speed, and having it abruptly end?</p>



<p>That reminds me of the hit tune &#8220;Road to Nowhere&#8221; by Talking Heads. I&#8217;m not suggesting David Byrne was influenced by Honegger, but the mechanically striking snare throughout the song makes you feel like you&#8217;re on your way somewhere. But as David sings, you&#8217;re not. And that is alright.</p>

		<span>Thinking about percussion led me to a revolution.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>I remember going to a football stadium for the first time when I was six years old to see a game at the Sport Lisboa and Benfica stadium. A large concrete stadium with a capacity of roughly 120.000 spectators. The score was 0-0 at halftime, and the fans were growing concerned. Then something happened that I had never experienced before. The concrete benches began to shake, a rumbling sound grew louder, and it felt like an earthquake. It was the supporters&#8217; feet that stomped on the ground. Thousands of people making a rhythmic sound altogether. It was frightening, powerful and incredible. It was my first experience with live percussion. Benfica won by 3-0.</p>



<p>Beginning my music degree with a study of rhythm and percussion prompted me to look into the history of percussion instruments and their role in music. I ended up viewing Steven Schick&#8217;s presentation. </p>

Available at: &lt;http://University/ of California Television (UCTV)&gt; [Accessed 17 June 2021].</figcaption></figure>



<p>The presentation was entertaining and light while yet being instructive. One thing he said remained with me out of all the things he mentioned. His definition of percussion instruments.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>&#8220;[Percussion instruments] are simple objects that make sound by striking them.&#8221;</p><cite>University of California Television (UCTV), 2013.&nbsp;<em>On the Bridge: The Beginnings of Contemporary Percussion Music with Steven Schick &#8212; To Be Musical</em>.  Available at: &lt;http://University/ of California Television (UCTV)&gt; [Accessed 17 June 2021].</cite></blockquote>



<p>It&#8217;s really that simple. It&#8217;s so simple that I believe anyone, regardless of musical knowledge, can play a percussion instrument. And I believe that is why percussion is at the very beginning of this course. It&#8217;s simple, doable and fun. And yet it&#8217;s so powerful.</p>



<p>Steven Schick also mentions a quote by John Cage.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Percussion music is revolution.&#8221;</p><cite>Cage, J., 1973.&nbsp;<em>Silence</em>. Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, p.87.</cite></blockquote>



<p>John Cage, I believe, meant that percussion allowed musicians to break away from the constraints imposed by classical composers who used the same sounds. Percussion provided an opportunity for exploration. Anything that generated a sound when struck may be included in the music. And the terms &#8220;percussion&#8221; and &#8220;revolution&#8221; immediately brought José Afonso&#8217;s Grândola Vila Morena to mind. Since it was utilized as the start of the Portuguese revolution, this is one of the most emblematic Portuguese songs. Only voice and the sound of marching feet on gravel can be heard during the entire song. And it caused a revolution, politically and musically speaking. For me, that was because of percussion. Isn&#8217;t it percussion if you hit the gravel with your feet? It makes sound by striking them, right?</p>
