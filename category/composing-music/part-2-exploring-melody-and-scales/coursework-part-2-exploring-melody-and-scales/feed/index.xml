<p>The goal of this project was to write nine woodwind pieces in nine distinct scales.</p>



<h5 id="1-whole-tone-scale">1 &#8211; Whole tone scale</h5>



<p>This scale appealed to me as mysterious and incomplete, which is why I abruptly ended this melody. Because the flute gives a light, airy, bright, and rich sound that matches this song, I used it in the middle register.</p>

<h5 id="2-whole-tone-scale">2 &#8211; Whole-tone scale</h5>



<p>This is another melody I&#8217;ve kept incomplete because I get the feeling of doubt when hearing the whole-tone scale. I picked up the alto saxophone for this exercise mostly out of curiosity. If used softly in the lower register, it can transmit a melancholic sound, but when played faster and in the upper register, it can sound hard and clear.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="363" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-1024x363.png" alt="" class="wp-image-298" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-1024x363.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-300x106.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-768x272.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-1536x544.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-2048x725.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-640x227.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-960x340.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="3-east-european-major-scale">3 &#8211; East European major scale</h5>



<p>With significant leaps (3 semitones) between the 2nd and 3rd, and the 6th and 7th, this scale in major sounds quite celebratory. The bassoon, especially with the staccato, is perfectly suited for humorous sound. That&#8217;s why I tried to include it into the melody&#8217;s opening section.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="356" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1024x356.png" alt="" class="wp-image-301" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1024x356.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-300x104.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-768x267.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1536x534.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-2048x711.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-640x222.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-960x333.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2.png 2116w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="4-east-european-minor-scale">4 &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">East European minor scale</h5>



<p>This scale, on the other hand, has a sorrowful and melancholy tone to it. I avoided choosing instruments that could communicate grief, such as the clarinet, and instead focused on the flute&#8217;s middle and low registers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="370" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-1024x370.png" alt="" class="wp-image-304" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-1024x370.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-300x108.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-768x278.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-1536x555.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-2048x741.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-640x231.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-960x347.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002.png 2077w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="5-middle-eastern-eight-note-scale">5 &#8211; Middle Eastern eight-note scale</h5>



<p>Due to the presence of numerous semitones, this scale sounded quite mysterious. Because of its dark timbre, I chose the contrabassoon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="207" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-1024x207.png" alt="" class="wp-image-306" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-1024x207.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-300x61.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-768x155.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-1536x310.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-2048x414.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-640x129.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-960x194.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006.png 2147w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="6-middle-eastern-eight-note-scale">6 &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">Middle Eastern eight-note scale</h5>



<p>This song maintains the mystery nature of the scale, but I attempted to give it a more Middle Eastern flavor. In its middle range, the oboe was ideal for what I was seeking for.</p>

<h5 id="7-nine-note-scale">7 &#8211; Nine-note scale</h5>



<p>The extra notes in this scale were used to create ornaments that are perfect for the piccolo. I ended up writing a pretty cheerful melody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="381" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-1024x381.png" alt="" class="wp-image-310" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-1024x381.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-300x111.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-768x285.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-1536x571.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-2048x761.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-640x238.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007-960x357.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0007.png 2123w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="8-nine-note-scale">8 &#8211; Nine-note scale</h5>



<p>The extra notes also were used as ornaments for the clarinet&#8217;s fast sections in this melody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="377" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-1024x377.png" alt="" class="wp-image-312" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-1024x377.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-300x111.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-768x283.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-1536x566.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-2048x755.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-640x236.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008-960x354.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0008.png 2084w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h5 id="9-chromatic-scale">9 &#8211; Chromatic scale</h5>



<p>Among all the scales I wrote, this one was probably the most fun, since I got to play with the rising and descending of the scale in the first part and then utilize it to show off the lower register of the clarinet in the second part.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The purpose of project 6 is to examine at least two solo wind instrument works from a provided list. It is recommended to keep the following observations in mind:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>the structural desgin</li><li>the melodic contour design</li><li>the scales and the tonality that are explored</li></ul>



<h2 id="jacques-ibert-piece-for-flute-alone" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629787956318 is-style-cnvs-block-section-heading-6 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Jacques Ibert ‚Äì Pi√®ce for flute alone</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>This work, written in 1936, was influenced by the movement started by&nbsp;Debussy&#8217;s Syrinx, to&nbsp;write&nbsp;for flute without accompaniment (Lee, 2018). Flute pieces were not very prevalent during the baroque era as solo instrument.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until the instrument&#8217;s development around the turn of the XX&nbsp;century that a large number of flute players emerged and began commissioning new works for the instrument. (Toff,&nbsp;2012). Pi√®ce for solo flute by Jaques Ibert was written for the French flautist Marcel Moyse.</p>

<p>This piece&#8217;s theme appeals to me much. It&#8217;s actually really simple. The supertonic and tonic dotted crochets are followed by six quavers, all in the Db scale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="168" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png" alt="" class="wp-image-267" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png 724w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-640x149.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p>I find this theme particularly appealing because these two notes work together like a sigh. The supertonic represents an inhale and the tonic represents a exhale. Since this piece was written in 1937, between the two great wars, I would say that its motif captures both the hope and disbelief of humanity. Are we going to be at war again? Perhaps not. Inhale. Or most likely, yes. Exhale. After these two notes, there is an answer to the question. Occasionally, they are optimistic and go up (bars 25 and 26), but they are usually pessimistic and go down.</p>



<p>There are 4 parts to this piece: Introduction &#8211; Part A &#8211; Part B &#8211; Part A&#8217;.</p>



<h2 id="introduction" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876025605 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Introduction</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The work begins with a gradual but increasing repetition of D, eventually developing to a quicker sequence of semiquavers and demisemiquavers. This introduction includes a rhythmic portion as well as a wide range of notes that demonstrate the flute&#8217;s tonal diversity. D4 to D6. It culminates in an ascension that leads to the main theme.</p>



<h2 id="part-a" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875870212 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The theme is presented and repeated to establish that this will be a recurring motif in all music and that the listener will remember it. Following that, Ibert interacts with the theme and cadence, frequently ending in surprising notes. It continues until bar 34, when it returns to the original theme but briefly switches to the Gb scale before returning to the D. The question (are we going to be at war?) is left unresolved at the end of this section.</p>



<h2 id="part-b" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876008964 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part B</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Part A is disrupted by this section. It momentarily switches to 9/8 time signature before switching to 3/4 &#8211; 2/4. There&#8217;s also a wave-like tune that conveys some anxiousness and unease. This is also sensed as we transition from a major to a minor scale. It&#8217;s the song&#8217;s most energizing section.</p>

<p>We return to the motif, but this time raised an octave. I believe that the composer needed to bring the listener back to the familiarity of the theme without losing the rush because we just came from such an exciting section. The melody then returns to its original octave, bringing us back home. We keep the sigh, just like we did at the start because the music provides no answers to the initial inquiry. Inhale, then exhale. And the piece ends in Db, which is a semitone below the composition&#8217;s starting note. The Db is repeated in the last bar, but two octaves lower. I don&#8217;t think it contributes anything to the finish and, in my opinion, should be omitted, just as Moyse did in the performance above.</p>



<p>When I started researching for this piece, I discovered that this is one of the most popular pieces among flute students. I&#8217;m beginning to see why. Ibert demonstrates the flute&#8217;s versatility throughout these 5 minutes of music, from trills to rapidly rising and falling scales, to the lovely two notes from the theme that, if performed effectively, can convey the optimism/pessimism duality that I believe the composer was attempting to portray.</p>

<p>Hovhaness was an Armenian-American composer who lived in the United States. Although I can&#8217;t discover a backstory for the Lament for Clarinet (1935), the Armenian exodus is a central motif in his Exile Symphony, which was written a year later (1936). (Athens, 2016). As a result, it&#8217;s plausible to assume that this sombre work was influenced by the Armenian situation in the United States and around the world.</p>

<p>This piece doesn&#8217;t appear to have a rigid structure, except for the main theme in bar 23 that is repeated with variations several times. There is also a motif featured at the beginning of the piece and repeated intermittently throughout.</p>



<p>The main theme consists of a fast rise from F to C, which is then sustained for nearly a full bar. Then there&#8217;s a quaver-crochet pattern that creates the impression that the character is walking or moving, but extremely slowly, as if dragging something, like a great pain.</p>

<p>The first notes, in my opinion, do an excellent job of portraying the composer&#8217;s grief. It reminds me of Sodade, a song by Cape Verdean singer Ces√°ria √âvora. It&#8217;s also a lament for her hometown, which she misses. The chorus&#8217;s initial two notes are a fast rise from G&nbsp;to C, akin to Hovaness&#8217; piece.</p>

<p>This informs me that the clarinet is excellent at resonating with the human voice, which I believe Hovaness was attempting to demonstrate in this piece. The clarinet sings a human grief.</p>



<p>This piece begins with a fast crescendo that demonstrates the clarinet&#8217;s vast range (F3 to C6). Everything slows down after this fast crescendo, with long sustained notes and a bend. I had no idea the clarinet could bend notes, which is fascinating to me. It has a lot of potentials to enhance mourning, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The composer then begins his exploration of the clarinet&#8217;s chalumeau register, with lower pitch notes, which, once again, is an excellent choice for passing the song&#8217;s sadness.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t figure out what scale the composer is using, although the majority of the notes picked sound exotic to me. I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s an Indian scale.</p>



<p>The theme is repeated four times, each time with slight modifications, but always ending on a lower pitch than when it began. It seems to be stating that no matter how hard the character tries to move up, it always ends up going down.</p>



<p>Then, with the reprise of the rising from the song&#8217;s beginning, there&#8217;s a ray of hope. A repetition of bars 19-21,  but again we return to a lower tone as if the character refuses to let go of his or her misery. Several times, hitting&nbsp;the same note, A.</p>



<p>We return to the main theme, always with the sadness of concluding on a lower tone than we began.</p>



<p>Here we begin a dialogue between hope and lament. Hope is a repetition of the preceding fast-rising, but this time it ascends to Db6, the highest note in all music. It&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s our character&#8217;s final hope, followed by a repeat of the first bar. Our character, on the other hand, gives up and plays the same notes for two bars.</p>



<p>Hopes responds by repeating the ascending to the highest tone. However, our character is slowly dying (the composer wrote the morendo in the score), with the semiquavers and crochets gradually fading to the low notes.</p>



<p>This composition struck me as very sad, and I believe that was the composer&#8217;s intention. Probably because of its history and all the stories he must have witnessed and experienced. Hovhaness was very familiar with the clarinet and its expressive possibilities (Wolverton, 2002), so it&#8217;s no surprise that this piece captures the melancholy and lament so beautifully.</p>



<p>As I previously stated, the clarinet has the ability to express human emotions, and when effectively crafted, it can feel as though there is a highly varied singer behind this instrument. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll remember this in my upcoming compositions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The purpose of this project, which is part 2 of the program, is to compose three short contrasting melodies for vocals based on the pentatonic scale. To keep them engaging, it&#8217;s a good idea to be conscious of the dynamics, tempo, and rhythm.</p>

<p>I attempted to make things as simple as possible in my first exercise, concentrating mostly on the melody shape. It&#8217;s written in C, but I begin in E to add interest and, at the same time, allow the melody shape to descend a little and prepare the listener to the highest note.</p>

<p>I opted to develop an exercise with the F# pentatonic because it can be played on the piano&#8217;s black keys. It began to have a Chinese sound to me, so I decided to give it a try. It ended up having an interesting melody shape, starting low, rising, going down, going higher, falling, going up a little and ending almost straight.</p>

<p>After hearing Debussy&#8217;s La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin, I was drawn to the main motif&#8217;s &#8220;wave&#8221; shape. I wanted to create a melody that resembled waves. I used the Bb pentatonic, but there&#8217;s a modulation to Eb in the middle, then back to Bb in the conclusion.</p>

<p>Finally, I believe that this effort helped me better comprehend the pentatonic scale&#8217;s possibilities and reinforce my knowledge of articulations from Taylor&#8217;s material.</p>
