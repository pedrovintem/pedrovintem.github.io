<p>One of the composers with whom I most identify is Claude Debussy. So when I stumbled across this piece when researching pentatonic scale melodies, I knew I&#8217;d like it. I was not mistaken.</p>

<p>My primary focus during this analysis will be on melody since that&#8217;s the component of the unit I&#8217;m studying.</p>



<p>This work, written by Claude Debussy between 1909 and 1910 for piano, was later transferred to a variety of other instruments.</p>



<p>The theme is introduced with a simple but lovely melodic line consisting entirely of Gb major pentatonic notes. I find this melody to be interesting because it ascends and descends in the pentatonic scale &#8212; in theory, that may sound boring, but it&#8217;s rather pleasing to listen to in this case.</p>



<p>The theme is then repeated, but instead of going up and down like the first time, we start descending the Gb scale in bar 10. This indicates that the music is going forward and not stuck in the same repetitive pattern, which should be uninteresting.</p>



<p>The work maintains its wave-like melody, but at bar 15, during one of the dramatic ascends, we switch to the Cb major pentatonic scale, reaching the highest note in the piece thus far. The melody then gradually descends in the Gb major scale, with the one quaver &#8211; two semiquavers that are so characteristic of this work, bringing familiarity and tranquillity to the music.</p>



<p>In bar 19, the score states &#8220;Un Peu Animé&#8221;, which I believe is the start of the song&#8217;s climax, where we ascend into three octaves in the scale of Eb Major and reach the highest note so far in the melody.</p>



<p>After the exhilaration of the finale, the primary theme returns, offering familiarity and security once more. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that this theme is a chord-based version of the familiar motif.</p>



<p>It all comes to a halt at bar 28 when the motif returns, but this time an octave higher. This gives the music a lot of tranquillity and a little dreaminess, in my opinion. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re reminiscing about how it all began. It&#8217;s also a little nostalgic.</p>



<p>In bar 33, we repeat bar 14, which brings us to the end of the song. The PP and minims make sure we reach a safe and stable conclusion.</p>



<p>Finally, I was drawn to this music since it is a singable melody that employs simple and common scales. This is the kind of melody I enjoy writing, and I&#8217;m hoping to get some inspiration from Debussy in Assignment 2.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C. This song from the eighteenth century piqued my curiosity, so I decided to investigate it more.</p>



<p>The lyrics are as follows, in their literal translation:</p>



<p>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>Sweet-smelling, beautiful, stems full of buds<br>Fragrant and white, everyone praises<br>Let me pluck you down<br>Give to someone else<br>Jasmine flower, oh jasmine flower</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When I first read this score, the slurs between two notes, going one tone up or down, gave it a very pleasant Chinese characteristic sound. It&#8217;s almost like a vocal slide that makes you feel either eager or peaceful depending on which direction you&#8217;re facing.</p>



<p>The song begins with a simple phrase that progresses from E to C, the song&#8217;s highest note, and then down to G. The song proceeds to a calmer section after the repetition of the first phrase, with mostly crochets and note repetition. It eventually descends to C, one octave lower than the highest C.</p>



<p>The last section is when the slur is used more frequently, most likely because the melody shifts from praising the jasmine blossom to taking it up and offering it to someone else. After ascending to the highest C, the song begins to descend to the lowest note, G. I believe the impression of falling down is achieved using this slurs going from E to lower G. It was strikingly beautiful to me.</p>



<p>I then went to Youtube to look for more versions of this song, and I came across this one by the Choir of St John&#8217;s College Cambridge, which I thought was the most fascinating arrangement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The purpose of this project, which is part 2 of the program, is to compose three short contrasting melodies for vocals based on the pentatonic scale. To keep them engaging, it&#8217;s a good idea to be conscious of the dynamics, tempo, and rhythm.</p>

<p>I attempted to make things as simple as possible in my first exercise, concentrating mostly on the melody shape. It&#8217;s written in C, but I begin in E to add interest and to allow the melody to descend a little to lead the listener to the highest note in the melody.</p>

<p>I opted to develop an exercise with the F# pentatonic because it can be played on the piano&#8217;s black keys. It began to sound Chinese to me, so I went with it. It ended up having a straight melody shape, starting low, rising, going down, going higher, falling, going up a little and ending almost straight.</p>

<p>After hearing Debussy&#8217;s La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin, I was drawn to the main motif&#8217;s &#8220;wave&#8221; shape. I wanted to create a melody that resembled waves. I used the Bb pentatonic, but there&#8217;s a modulation to Eb in the middle, then back to Bb in the conclusion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="438" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-1024x438.png" alt="" class="wp-image-247" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-1024x438.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-300x128.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-768x328.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-1536x656.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-2048x875.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-640x273.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-960x410.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Finally, I believe that this effort helped me better comprehend the pentatonic scale&#8217;s possibilities and reinforce my knowledge of articulations from Taylor&#8217;s material.</p>

<p>I must confess that, aside from knowing what the pentatonic scale was, I had no idea how important it was in music. I used to think it was a simple scale that was mostly used in nursery rhymes and was used as the first scale a novice learns.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that I was not mistaken, after viewing this incredible video by musician Anuja Kamat, I realized that the pentatonic scale is used all over the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>But why is the pentatonic scale employed by ancient civilizations and people all across the world? Mathematics and frequency are the keys to the solution. Because all notes have a straightforward relationship between them, as illustrated in the points below, all notes sound good. As a result, they appeal to everyone&#8217;s ears.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>tonic has whatever frequency&nbsp;you first chose</li><li>supertonic has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1⅛</li><li>mediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1¼</li><li>dominant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1½</li><li>submediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1⅔</li><li>tonic (octave above) has the frequency of orginal tonic&nbsp;multiplied by 2</li></ul>



<p>The pentatonic scale appears in a variety of musical styles, which is fascinating. In the Chinese folk tune Mo Li Hua, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In the well-known Amazing Grace, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="96" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-300x28.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-768x72.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-640x60.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-960x90.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image.png 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Hold On We&#8217;re Going Home by Drake is another song that uses the pentatonic scale, which is quite prevalent in pop music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="79" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-300x23.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-768x59.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1536x119.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-2048x159.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-640x50.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-960x74.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1.png 2066w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It is also employed by classical composers. Debussy&#8217;s La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin contains another melody based on the pentatonic scale (except for an F).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.teoria.com/res/images/articles/debussy-fille-aux-cheveux-des-lin/tema.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>It makes me wonder whether maybe the pentatonic scale is the so-coveted universal language. A common language shared by people from various places, cultures, and eras. Even if two persons from completely different cultures and musical backgrounds are brought together, they may agree that these five notes sound good. </p>



<p>This Bob McFerrin story exemplifies it perfectly.</p>

<p>Although I still believe the pentatonic scale is a simple scale, I now recognize its significance in music and the vast possibilities it offers. I&#8217;m going to use them in the pentatonic scale melody project I&#8217;m working on.</p>
