		<span>From what I knew just three months ago, I&#8217;m seeing remarkable development.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it if someone told me a few months ago that I&#8217;d be composing and notating a 2-minute solo piece. Three months ago, I was having difficulty reading music scores, using software like Sibelius, and understanding some musical concepts.   My tutor told me that it was normal and that I should expect a learning curve, but I had not anticipated making such rapid progress in such a short period of time.</p>



<p>I learned a lot about scales and, in particular, how melodies are made. I had a lot of fun analyzing everything from simple ancient melodies to more complicated and contemporary ones, which helped me with my Assignment 2 composition.</p>

<p>Part 2 of the course led me to conduct more research on woodwind instruments and to listen to how different composers used the characteristics and limitations of each instrument in their melodies.</p>

<h3 id="about-assignment-2">About Assignment 2</h3>



<p>The assignment took far longer than I thought once again. According to the OCA assignment introduction, this should take about 3 hours, yet it took me about 3 days. Despite the amount of time it took me, I am quite pleased with the outcome. I was able to incorporate my idea for this work into the score, generating two contrasting parts for the two clarinet registers &#8211; chalumeau and clarion.</p>



<p>The four basic elements of music are rhythm, melody, harmony, and tone colour (Copland, Rich and Slatkin, 2011). Because this section of the course is about melody, I concentrated on the melodic rather than the rhythmic aspects of the piece. I wanted at least one memorable section of the tune that the listener would recognize immediately when it was repeated. With the main motif, I believe I was successful.</p>



<p>Although I liked creating for untuned percussion, I must say that composing for a pitched instrument was far more enjoyable. However, I must admit that the rhythm aspect was crucial, particularly in terms of not being stuck with a time signature or employing pauses as rhythmic alterations.</p>



<p>On the downside, I believe I could improve some aspects of my composition. I think the music sometimes goes to predictable places rather than surprising the listener with unexpected notes. In the next assignment, I must avoid this. I also believe I rushed several parts of the composition when the music needed to rest. Due to the 2-minute time limit, this was necessary.</p>



<p>Overall, I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing what my tutor thinks of this work and any ideas and adjustments he or she may have.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As part of the second assignment, I had to write a composition for a solo woodwind instrument that lasted between 1:30 and 2 minutes. The challenge of this composition is that I can use whichever scale I choose (it can be more than one scale), to take advantage of the instrument&#8217;s specific features and to respect its range.</p>



<p>You can find the final score <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=119PoSR35LbSVWA-Gnx6kXQBo5EyIMBrI" data-type="URL" data-id="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=119PoSR35LbSVWA-Gnx6kXQBo5EyIMBrI" target="_blank">here</a> and listen to it below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Assignment-2.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>Just like in the first assignment, I thought it was beneficial to create an outline and get an idea of what I was trying to accomplish beforehand. Though it may seem counterproductive at first, the structure and the idea helped me stay focused and keep a coherent thought process.</p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1631516667878 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Idea / Theme</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>This piece will centre around a character that is mournful during the workweek and eccentric on the weekend. In a routine and boring job, weekdays become monotonous and boring, while weekends become exciting and fun.</p>



<p>Usually on Mondays you feel melancholy, Tuesday through Thursday are monotonous and regretful, followed by Friday and Saturday with euphoria, and finally Sunday turns slowly into melancholy again and you&#8217;re back on Monday.</p>



<h2 id="the-structure" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1631516674208 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Structure</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>As soon as I had the idea, the structure made sense to me. First, there is an intro, followed by the main theme, and then there is a happy section. Revert to the main motif before ending the same way it began.</p>



<p>For the first two parts, the tempo would be slow, followed by a fast tempo for the third part, and then slowly decreasing for the final two parts.</p>

		<span>The Motifs</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>My process for composing a motif was to play simple lines on the piano and to find one that sounds right to me. Inspiration overcame transpiration in this case. After some time, I began playing these four notes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="360" height="208" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.13.05.png" alt="" class="wp-image-350" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.13.05.png 360w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.13.05-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></figure>



<p>In spite of the simplicity of the melody, I liked the quaver/crochet rhythm, which gave me a sense of lull and monotony that I felt was appropriate for the B part. Although it feels like it is going up, it lacks the strength to stay up and goes down. Likewise, our character longs for the energy to accomplish something but returns to mourning.</p>



<p>After that, I discovered that the scale I wanted to work on would be the E harmonic minor, with the seventh diminished, which sounds exotic but at the same time lamenting.</p>



<p>The A part of the song has a similar motif to the B part, but to me, it feels more nostalgic, like someone is remembering the good old days (like the weekend).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="410" height="236" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.12.33.png" alt="" class="wp-image-351" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.12.33.png 410w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.12.33-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></figure>



<p>Because the C part is festive, I knew right away that I needed to change the scale, but not by much because the character remains the same and I didn&#8217;t want to have a big contrast. I chose to use the Ukrainian minor scale in the key of C, which is one of the most widely used scales in Klezmer music. As I worked with this scale, I realized these are exactly the notes of the G harmonic minor scale. I found this scale very festive even though it is a minor scale, which goes against the common idea that minor scales are sad.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="250" height="186" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.14.47.png" alt="" class="wp-image-352"/></figure>



<p>In the C part of the song, the motif is made up of quavers and semiquavers, enjoying the wonderful staccato the clarinet can produce.</p>

		<span>The Clarinet</span>

</h2>



<p>The clarinet is extremely versatile, and that&#8217;s why I chose it. With this piece, I wanted to push myself to explore both low and high registers while maintaining a cohesive line throughout. Clarinets have the broadest range of all woodwinds and can easily transition from <em>pianissimo</em> to <em>fortissimo</em> (Adler, 2002).</p>



<p>My research on the clarinet led me to these videos from Josh Plotner which explain, among other things, that the composer should avoid the Throat Tones register (from G4 to Bb4) due to its hollowness and weak sound. Although I tried to avoid these notes, it was difficult for me to eliminate them from the melody.</p>



<p>In the videos, it is also explained to avoid flutter tongue and use growl instead, since it sounds better.</p>

<p>It is also advised to avoid the transition between B4 and Bb4, referred to as &#8220;the break,&#8221; due to its difficult transition that only experienced players can handle (Adler, 2002).</p>

		<span>The Composition</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p><strong>Part A</strong> Bars 1-9</p>



<p>This section serves as a brief introduction and presents the first motif. The purpose of this section is to show the listener that the melody will stay in the Chalumeau register.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 1-4 are slow notes establishing the scale</li><li>Bars 5-9 are the part A motif followed by a descending to end this part</li></ul>



<p><strong>Part B</strong> Bars 10-19</p>



<p>While the tempo remains the same, the time signature switches to 3/4 here, and the dynamics increase. As a result, the listener can feel the character&#8217;s discomfort and lament.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 10-11 the main motif is presented and raised by one step</li><li>Bars 12-13 a variation of the motif going down and ending in the 5th</li><li>Bar 14 is a variation of the main motif</li><li>Bar 15 is a repetition of bar 11</li><li>Bar 16 is similar to bar 11 but with the extra QUAVER</li><li>Bars 17-19 the melody descends ending with a trill to the tonic</li></ul>



<p><strong>Part C</strong> Bars 20-43</p>



<p>In contrast to the previous two, this is the fastest section. Here, glissandos and growls are used to convey the feel of the parties and the exuberance of the weekend concept.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bar 20 is a scale run ascending over two octaves</li><li>Bar 21-22 a glissando sustained and played fortissimo</li><li>Bars 23-24 a crescendo in dynamics and offbeat notes</li><li>Bars 25-27 is the part C motif and its variations</li><li>Bar 28 the triplets are descending</li><li>Bars 29-30 are another variation of the motif</li><li>Bars 31-32 is the repetition of the same note in the semiquaver/quaver rhythm, ending in a flutter tongue in the highest E</li><li>Bars 33-34 are a variation of the motif</li><li>Bars 35-39 the quavers are used with the staccato</li><li>Bars 40-43 are a descending of crochets with quavers in between</li></ul>



<p><strong>Part B&#8217;</strong> Bars 44-51</p>



<p>The B part is shortened here, leading the listener slowly from the party of the C section to the end. Dynamic returns to <em>piano</em>.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 44-47 return to the harmonic scale and to the crochet/quaver rhtyhm</li><li>Bars 48-51 are the main motif with a few variations</li></ul>



<p><strong>Part A&#8217;</strong> Bars 52-58</p>



<p>While this section is slower than the previous one, it is similar to the introduction, ending in the same note as it began, giving it the appearance of being forever looped.</p>



<ul id="block-ad39ec09-be8d-4cce-993a-7a3c6c802173" class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 52-55 are similar to bars 5-7 but in a 3/4 time signature</li><li>Bar 56 is made entirely of crochets</li><li>Bars 57-58 a little pause to breathe into the instrument and realising the final two notes</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I do not intend to conduct in-depth analyses of these solo compositions, but rather to concentrate on how the composers wrote for that unique instrument. What techniques they employed, and how they attained various tonalities and colours in relation to each instrument.</p>



<h2 id="flute">Flute</h2>



<h5 id="claude-debussy-syrinx">Claude Debussy &#8211; Syrinx</h5>



<p>Due to the fact that it is likely the first flute solo piece written since the baroque period, Syrinx is one of the most important pieces written for flute solo. More composers were motivated to create for the unaccompanied flute as a result of this (Lee, 2018).</p>



<p>This composition, as well as the growing interest in the flute as a solo instrument, is thought to be attributable to advancements in the instrument, which allowed for new methods and sound colour. Indeed, Debussy explores the flute&#8217;s various tonalities and ranges. Consider the motif in the first bar, which is played in a high range with <em>mezzo-forte</em>.</p>

<p>The same motif is repeated, but in a lower range and <em>piano</em>, giving the piece a darker feel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="179" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-1024x179.png" alt="" class="wp-image-334" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-1024x179.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-300x52.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-768x134.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-1536x268.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-640x112.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-960x167.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55.png 1606w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Debussy uses the flute&#8217;s many ranges, travelling from C4 to E6 with multiple wave-like movements, creating a hypnotic sound.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="209" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-1024x209.png" alt="" class="wp-image-336" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-1024x209.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-300x61.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-768x156.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-1536x313.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-640x130.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-960x196.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32.png 1590w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s fascinating to hear Debussy move from the piece&#8217;s climax to its conclusion using an almost all direct descending line in the final section of Syrinx. At the same time, he goes from a <em>mezzo-forte</em> to a <em>piano</em>. This demonstrates how the flute may go from a loud and detailed high note, suited for demisemiquavers, to a very low register that is calmer, darker, and more sustained.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="784" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-1024x784.png" alt="" class="wp-image-335" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-1024x784.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-300x230.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-768x588.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-1536x1176.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-640x490.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-960x735.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54.png 1594w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 id="oboe">Oboe</h2>



<h5 id="gordon-jacob-seven-bagatelles">Gordon Jacob &#8211; Seven Bagatelles</h5>



<p>Gordon Jacob composed seven short solo oboe compositions. The works are all fairly different, demonstrating the oboe&#8217;s tonal versatility as a solo instrument.</p>



<p>The oboe&#8217;s ability to play a mixture of legato and staccato phrases in a light bouncy style, like in 5 &#8211; Limerick, is one example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="958" height="324" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54.png" alt="" class="wp-image-337" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54.png 958w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54-300x101.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54-768x260.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54-640x216.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></figure>



<p>In 4 &#8211; Slow Air, Jacob also explores the prolonged notes as well as the various dynamics that sound lethargic or sorrowful.</p>

<p>The 2 &#8211; Elegy explores the melody lines that fit the oboe so well, as well as the big intervals that provide a wonderful contrast, especially in the high registers.</p>

<h2 id="saxophone">Saxophone</h2>



<h5 id="paul-creston-sonata-for-alto-saxophone-and-piano-op-19">Paul Creston &#8211; Sonata for Alto Saxophone and Piano, Op. 19</h5>



<p>I looked for a version of the saxophone solo as suggested, but all I found was the sonata accompanied by the piano. I&#8217;m not sure if this is the only version of the sonata available.</p>



<p>Before researching for this piece, I had never heard of Paul Creston, and I was pleased to learn that he was glad to create for often-overlooked instruments (Watanabe, 2011). Indeed, there were not many works dedicated to the saxophone in the 1930s, when this sonata was written (Mauk, 2015), therefore I was intrigued to learn what specific aspects he wrote for this instrument.</p>



<p>This work is structured into three movements, each of which is different. He begins with a jazzy opening, then transitions to a slower second movement before concluding with a more rhythmic movement. This demonstrates a saxophone&#8217;s adaptability, which I thought noteworthy.</p>



<p>One thing I observed in the first movement is the tempo shifts, which go from a fast <meta charset="utf-8">♩=126 “With vigor” to a calming in bar 10 and then a rise in bar 17. These changes are ideal for the saxophone, which can gracefully handle both slow and quick shifts.</p>

<p>The dynamics of the saxophone in this tune are one of the most noticeable variances. It has a wide range of dynamics, similar to the clarinet, and in this composition, it ranges from pianissimo to fortissimo. However, in contrast to the clarinet, I found the pianissimo not so soft and the fortissimo a little to bright. I&#8217;m curious how these dynamic shifts would function in a woodwind ensemble.</p>



<p>The second movement is a little more serene, with long notes that are representative of what one would expect from a saxophone. This movement surprised me least despite being extremely melodic and almost singable.</p>



<p>The third movement, on the other hand, surprised me the most, especially because I wasn&#8217;t expecting to hear the saxophone play such a rhythmic role. The saxophone sounds incredibly expressive and almost danceable in this passage, from the main theme to the staccato followed by the marcato.</p>

<h2 id="bassoon">Bassoon</h2>



<h5 id="willson-osborne-rhapsody-for-bassoon">Willson Osborne &#8211; Rhapsody for Bassoon</h5>



<p>Just one thing to mention: the C.F. Peters Corp edition of this score has beautiful lettering.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FTWQ30DqL.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="402"/></figure>



<p>My previous perception of the bassoon was that it is a very melancholy instrument. Wilson Osborne did not mislead me.</p>



<p>Slow parts are no problem for the bassoon, but what amazed me the most was how beautifully the quick runs worked. Osborne was able to arrange it in a very melodious manner, demonstrating the bassoon&#8217;s versatility.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="517" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-1024x517.png" alt="" class="wp-image-368" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-1024x517.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-300x152.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-768x388.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-1536x776.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-2048x1034.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-640x323.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-960x485.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17.png 2356w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The bassoon is a fantastic solo instrument in all registers, but when it&#8217;s accompanied, it gets swallowed up by the other instruments (Adler, 2002). That&#8217;s why Osborne presumably didn&#8217;t stick to the bassoon&#8217;s lower registers, opting instead to use the higher register, which is thin yet expressive.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="311" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-1024x311.png" alt="" class="wp-image-369" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-1024x311.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-300x91.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-768x233.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-1536x466.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-640x194.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-960x291.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53.png 1582w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Because the bassoon can&#8217;t handle forceful blows, it&#8217;s not surprising that Osborne didn&#8217;t go over <em>forte</em> in terms of dynamics.</p>



<p>The relative lack of rests was the last thing I noticed that I wasn&#8217;t anticipating. The bassoonist, in my opinion, would benefit from more breathing time and lengthier breaks. But I don&#8217;t believe Osborne agreed.</p>

		<span>What makes a happy melody?</span>

</h2>



<p>I was listening to music on Spotify on shuffle when Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro came on, and I had a thought: why do I feel happy every time I hear this song, particularly the chorus? I&#8217;ll try to figure it out by examining its melody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Tim Maia - Não Quero Dinheiro(Só quero amar) in Enlgish &amp; PT-BR" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOlLs6D7BpU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Tim Maia was a Brazilian musician who is regarded as one of the country&#8217;s most influential musicians. Maia pioneered sambalanço with Jorge Ben, a genre that combines samba, soul, funk, and rock and roll.</p>



<p>In 1971, he recorded Não Quero Dinheiro, a samba/soul song in which he declares, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any money, I just want love,&#8221; in response to rising consumerism. It&#8217;s a love song that&#8217;s likely influenced by the peace and love movement of the 1960s. The song went on to become a great success. Note that Brazil was under a dictatorship at the time, and this style of music was used as an escape from oppression.</p>



<p>This song catches my attention because of its general cheerfulness and happiness just by listening to it. This is, in my opinion, to do with repetition, syncopation, and tension.</p>



<p>The song begins with a syncopated melody that is repeated twice before the variation. This is the song&#8217;s verse, and while the tone is lively, it does not reach the climax of the chorus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="247" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-1024x247.png" alt="" class="wp-image-327" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-1024x247.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-300x72.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-768x185.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-1536x370.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-640x154.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10-960x231.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-06-at-13.20.10.png 1610w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>First verse of Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro</figcaption></figure>



<p>The chorus is the most joyful element of the song, but Tim Maia&#8217;s creation of a hymn with only three notes is even more astounding. And I believe that repetition is the key. In the first part of the chorus, the A is repeated 32 times.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="238" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1024x238.png" alt="" class="wp-image-328" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1024x238.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-768x178.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1536x357.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-2048x476.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-640x149.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-960x223.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001.png 2187w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>First part of the chorus of <meta charset="utf-8">Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you listen to this melody alone, especially on the piano, you&#8217;ll hear almost a childlike repetition. As if a child was trying to prove she was better than others. It seems like you might be able to sing &#8220;My toy is better than yours&#8221; in this melody.</p>



<p>This chorus is also characterized by tension. The song repeats itself six times, creating tension, with the hope of resolution which comes in half of the seventh bar. The repetition-tension-resolution game continues throughout the entire melody.</p>



<p>I was delighted to discover this Ted Talk about music repetition by Elizabeth Margulis, Professor and Director of Princeton University&#8217;s Music Cognition Lab.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, repetition makes you feel that music is more enjoyable, more interesting and more human. Music critics, according to Margulis, are often embarrassed by repetition, believing it to be childish or regressive; but repetition, far from being embarrassing, helps us to think of music as a way of seeing the world.</p>



<p>Not to be forgotten is Beethoven&#8217;s repeated four-note theme in his Symphony No. 5 or Ravel&#8217;s Bolero, which is composed entirely of variations on a single motif.</p>



<p>Finally, in my opinion, what makes this melody feel happy and cheery is the same childish repetition that reminds you of a period when life was simple and happy, and all you cared about was playing and being happy. And those joyful memories are made up of repeated memories.</p>

		<span>I&#8217;ve learned that I&#8217;ve always liked counterpoint.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>My tutor encouraged me to add research in my log on terminology that I wasn&#8217;t familiar with. So I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;d heard of counterpoint before, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what it meant. Therefore I decided to research it and in the process, I realized I began playing music due to the counterpoint.</p>



<p>To begin with, the basic definition of counterpoint is when at least two melodies are layered one on top of the other (Wood, 1932). Bach&#8217;s two-part Inventions (Taylor, 2012) are an example of such counterpoint:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="865" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-1024x865.png" alt="" class="wp-image-323" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-1024x865.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-300x253.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-768x649.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-640x540.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-960x811.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02.png 1376w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Although there are many examples of counterpoint, canons, and fugues in classical music, I was curious if it was applied in recent popular music.</p>



<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers were one of my favorite bands growing up, mainly because of Flea&#8217;s bass lines. That is why I decided to learn to play the bass. That was counterpoint working on rock music, I had no idea. And counterpoint was the reason I was so captivated with that band.</p>

<p>Queen was another band I grew up admiring, and Freddy Mercury and Brian May were masters of counterpoint. In this Killer Queen example, notice how the guitar and backup vocals occasionally play their own melodies:</p>

<p>I looked into other examples and realized that, while not being a band I normally listen to, Radiohead used a lot of counterpoints in their music, which made me enjoy them far more. For example, just listening to the melody of the trombone in their song Life In A Glasshouse is lovely.</p>

<p>And, since it&#8217;s Friday, here&#8217;s one more example of how the guitar, in addition to the vocal melody and band harmony, plays its own melody. The guitar is isolated in this example because I believe it is simpler to understand the melody of the guitar, and anyone who knows the song can place the voice melody on top without listening to it.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that my reflection on the counterpoint in this piece is superficial, and that thousands of pages have been written about it, but it has helped me to better comprehend the concept and develop it in my future work.</p>

<p>The goal of this project was to write nine woodwind pieces in nine distinct scales.</p>



<h5 id="1-whole-tone-scale">1 &#8211; Whole tone scale</h5>



<p>This scale appealed to me as mysterious and incomplete, which is why I abruptly ended this melody. Because the flute gives a light, airy, bright, and rich sound that matches this song, I used it in the middle register.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="456" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-1024x456.png" alt="" class="wp-image-296" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-1024x456.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-300x134.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-768x342.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-1536x684.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2048x912.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-640x285.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-960x428.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001.png 2077w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7-1.mp3"></audio></figure>



<h5 id="2-whole-tone-scale">2 &#8211; Whole-tone scale</h5>



<p>This is another melody I&#8217;ve kept incomplete because I get the feeling of doubt when hearing the whole-tone scale. I picked up the alto saxophone for this exercise mostly out of curiosity. If used softly in the lower register, it can transmit a melancholic sound, but when played faster and in the upper register, it can sound hard and clear.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="363" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-1024x363.png" alt="" class="wp-image-298" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-1024x363.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-300x106.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-768x272.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-1536x544.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-2048x725.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-640x227.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005-960x340.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0005.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7-6.mp3"></audio></figure>



<h5 id="3-east-european-major-scale">3 &#8211; East European major scale</h5>



<p>With significant leaps (3 semitones) between the 2nd and 3rd, and the 6th and 7th, this scale in major sounds quite celebratory. The bassoon, especially with the staccato, is perfectly suited for humorous sound. That&#8217;s why I tried to include it into the melody&#8217;s opening section.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="356" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1024x356.png" alt="" class="wp-image-301" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1024x356.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-300x104.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-768x267.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1536x534.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-2048x711.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-640x222.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-960x333.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2.png 2116w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="4-east-european-minor-scale">4 &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">East European minor scale</h5>



<p>This scale, on the other hand, has a sorrowful and melancholy tone to it. I avoided choosing instruments that could communicate grief, such as the clarinet, and instead focused on the flute&#8217;s middle and low registers.</p>

<p>Due to the presence of numerous semitones, this scale sounded quite mysterious. Because of its dark timbre, I chose the contrabassoon.</p>

<p>This song maintains the mystery nature of the scale, but I attempted to give it a more Middle Eastern flavor. In its middle range, the oboe was ideal for what I was seeking for.</p>

<p>The extra notes in this scale were used to create ornaments that are perfect for the piccolo. I ended up writing a pretty cheerful melody.</p>

<p>Among all the scales I wrote, this one was probably the most fun, since I got to play with the rising and descending of the scale in the first part and then utilize it to show off the lower register of the clarinet in the second part.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To compose melodies for woodwind instruments (Project 7), I first researched what types of instruments exist in the woodwind family, how to write for them, and what techniques they can achieve.</p>



<p>I found Samuel Adler&#8217;s book The Study of Orchestration to be an excellent resource for learning about orchestral instruments.</p>



<h2 id="classification" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1630378076466 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Classification</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Woodwind instruments are classified according to their families, reed type, pipe shape, intervals, and transposition (Adler, 2002). Classifying by family, in my opinion, makes more sense:</p>



<ol class="is-style-default"><li>The flute family &#8211; picollo, flute, alto flute, bass flute. The recorder is omitted since is not used in modern symphony orchestra (Adler, 2002).</li><li>The oboe family &#8211; oboe, oboe d&#8217;amour, English horn, hecklephone, bassoon, contrabassoon</li><li>The clarinet family &#8211; C, D, Eb, Bb, and A clarinets, alto clarinet (Eb), bass clarinet (generally in Bb, sometimes in Eb), contrabass clarinet (Bb or Eb), basset horn (F)</li><li>The saxophone family &#8211; sopranino (usually in Eb), soprano (Bb), alto (Eb), tenor (Bb), baritone (Eb), and bass saxophone (Bb) </li></ol>



<h2 id="transposition" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1630378089007 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Transposition</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>A transposing instrument generates pitches that aren&#8217;t the same as what&#8217;s on the page. <a href="http://www.orchestralibrary.com/reftables/rang.html#woodwinds" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.orchestralibrary.com/reftables/rang.html#woodwinds" target="_blank">This reference table, which I found on the website orchestralibrary.com</a>, is quite valuable because it includes not only the instrument range but also their transpositions.</p>



<p>The fundamental rule for all transposing instruments is that the written C will sound the instrument&#8217;s designated pitch. (2002, Adler)</p>



<h2 id="techniques" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1630379582051 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Techniques</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Woodwinds may generate a variety of techniques, and while it varies per instrument, most techniques are more difficult to manage in extreme registers than in middle registers (Adler, 2002).</p>



<h5 id="vibrato">Vibrato</h5>



<p>By default, the player can choose when to use vibrato, and the composer needs only to indicate <em>senza vibrato</em> or <em>non vibrato</em> if he does not want vibrato to be performed.</p>



<h5 id="tonguing-and-phrasing">Tonguing and phrasing</h5>



<p>A woodwind instrument&#8217;s articulations are affected by tonguing with a tuh-like or a duh-like sound. Unless there is a slur, notes are articulated separately and tongued. If there are slurs, notes are played in one breath with tongue only used on the first note. It is called legato.</p>



<h5 id="staccato">Staccato</h5>



<p>A dot above or below the note will produce a very short note with a natural separation between notes.</p>



<h5 id="soft-tonguing">Soft tonguing</h5>



<p>Soft tonguing is represented by slurs written in notes with dots or slashes. It has the same impact as slurred staccato.</p>



<h5 id="double-tonguing">Double tonguing</h5>



<p>In quick passages, double tonguing is used to produce a sound similar to te ke.</p>



<h5 id="dynamic-envelopes">Dynamic envelopes</h5>



<p>Moving from a strong attack to a lower volume and then back up to a higher level creates a powerful effect. Although woodwinds are not the only instruments that can achieve this effect, they are the greatest at it.</p>



<h5 id="flutter-tongue">Flutter tongue</h5>



<p>This effect creates a rolled <em>r</em> sound, which is common in woodwind instruments. Except for oboes and bassoons, it&#8217;s simple to play on most instruments. To create the optimum sound, the flutter tongue may require extended notes or complete passages. <em>Flutter tongue</em> or <em>flatterzunge</em> must be noted above the passage in the score.</p>



<h5 id="other-special-effects">Other special effects</h5>



<p>Multiphonics, when an instrument produces more than a note.</p>



<p>Glissandi, can be used in the upward direction, especially in clarinet and saxophone.</p>



<p>Slap tonguing produces a perky and snappy attack.</p>



<p>Key clicking, when the player slaps the notes without blowing air.</p>



<p>Whistle tones, when the player turns the instrument far from the face and blows across it.</p>



<p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The purpose of project 6 is to examine at least two solo wind instrument works from a provided list. It is recommended to keep the following observations in mind:</p>

<h2 id="jacques-ibert-piece-for-flute-alone" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629787956318 is-style-cnvs-block-section-heading-6 halignleft" >

		<span>Jacques Ibert – Pièce for flute alone</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>This work, written in 1936, was influenced by the movement started by&nbsp;Debussy&#8217;s Syrinx, to&nbsp;write&nbsp;for flute without accompaniment (Lee, 2018). Flute pieces were not very prevalent during the baroque era as solo instrument.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until the instrument&#8217;s development around the turn of the XX&nbsp;century that a large number of flute players emerged and began commissioning new works for the instrument. (Toff,&nbsp;2012). Pièce for solo flute by Jaques Ibert was written for the French flautist Marcel Moyse.</p>

<p>This piece&#8217;s theme appeals to me much. It&#8217;s actually really simple. The supertonic and tonic dotted crochets are followed by six quavers, all in the Db scale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="168" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png" alt="" class="wp-image-267" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png 724w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-640x149.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p>I find this theme particularly appealing because these two notes work together like a sigh. The supertonic represents an inhale and the tonic represents a exhale. Since this piece was written in 1937, between the two great wars, I would say that its motif captures both the hope and disbelief of humanity. Are we going to be at war again? Perhaps not. Inhale. Or most likely, yes. Exhale. After these two notes, there is an answer to the question. Occasionally, they are optimistic and go up (bars 25 and 26), but they are usually pessimistic and go down.</p>



<p>There are 4 parts to this piece: Introduction &#8211; Part A &#8211; Part B &#8211; Part A&#8217;.</p>



<h2 id="introduction" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876025605 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Introduction</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The work begins with a gradual but increasing repetition of D, eventually developing to a quicker sequence of semiquavers and demisemiquavers. This introduction includes a rhythmic portion as well as a wide range of notes that demonstrate the flute&#8217;s tonal diversity. D4 to D6. It culminates in an ascension that leads to the main theme.</p>



<h2 id="part-a" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875870212 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The theme is presented and repeated to establish that this will be a recurring motif in all music and that the listener will remember it. Following that, Ibert interacts with the theme and cadence, frequently ending in surprising notes. It continues until bar 34, when it returns to the original theme but briefly switches to the Gb scale before returning to the D. The question (are we going to be at war?) is left unresolved at the end of this section.</p>



<h2 id="part-b" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876008964 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part B</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Part A is disrupted by this section. It momentarily switches to 9/8 time signature before switching to 3/4 &#8211; 2/4. There&#8217;s also a wave-like tune that conveys some anxiousness and unease. This is also sensed as we transition from a major to a minor scale. It&#8217;s the song&#8217;s most energizing section.</p>



<h2 id="part-a-2" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875998799 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A&#8217;</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>We return to the motif, but this time raised an octave. I believe that the composer needed to bring the listener back to the familiarity of the theme without losing the rush because we just came from such an exciting section. The melody then returns to its original octave, bringing us back home. We keep the sigh, just like we did at the start because the music provides no answers to the initial inquiry. Inhale, then exhale. And the piece ends in Db, which is a semitone below the composition&#8217;s starting note. The Db is repeated in the last bar, but two octaves lower. I don&#8217;t think it contributes anything to the finish and, in my opinion, should be omitted, just as Moyse did in the performance above.</p>



<p>When I started researching for this piece, I discovered that this is one of the most popular pieces among flute students. I&#8217;m beginning to see why. Ibert demonstrates the flute&#8217;s versatility throughout these 5 minutes of music, from trills to rapidly rising and falling scales, to the lovely two notes from the theme that, if performed effectively, can convey the optimism/pessimism duality that I believe the composer was attempting to portray.</p>



<h2 id="alan-hovhaness-lament-for-clarinet" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629880624643 is-style-cnvs-block-section-heading-6 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Alan Hovhaness &#8211; Lament for Clarinet</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Hovhaness was an Armenian-American composer who lived in the United States. Although I can&#8217;t discover a backstory for the Lament for Clarinet (1935), the Armenian exodus is a central motif in his Exile Symphony, which was written a year later (1936). (Athens, 2016). As a result, it&#8217;s plausible to assume that this sombre work was influenced by the Armenian situation in the United States and around the world.</p>

<p>This piece doesn&#8217;t appear to have a rigid structure, except for the main theme in bar 23 that is repeated with variations several times. There is also a motif featured at the beginning of the piece and repeated intermittently throughout.</p>



<p>The main theme consists of a fast rise from F to C, which is then sustained for nearly a full bar. Then there&#8217;s a quaver-crochet pattern that creates the impression that the character is walking or moving, but extremely slowly, as if dragging something, like a great pain.</p>

<p>The first notes, in my opinion, do an excellent job of portraying the composer&#8217;s grief. It reminds me of Sodade, a song by Cape Verdean singer Cesária Évora. It&#8217;s also a lament for her hometown, which she misses. The chorus&#8217;s initial two notes are a fast rise from G&nbsp;to C, akin to Hovaness&#8217; piece.</p>

<p>This informs me that the clarinet is excellent at resonating with the human voice, which I believe Hovaness was attempting to demonstrate in this piece. The clarinet sings a human grief.</p>



<p>This piece begins with a fast crescendo that demonstrates the clarinet&#8217;s vast range (F3 to C6). Everything slows down after this fast crescendo, with long sustained notes and a bend. I had no idea the clarinet could bend notes, which is fascinating to me. It has a lot of potentials to enhance mourning, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The composer then begins his exploration of the clarinet&#8217;s chalumeau register, with lower pitch notes, which, once again, is an excellent choice for passing the song&#8217;s sadness.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t figure out what scale the composer is using, although the majority of the notes picked sound exotic to me. I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s an Indian scale.</p>



<p>The theme is repeated four times, each time with slight modifications, but always ending on a lower pitch than when it began. It seems to be stating that no matter how hard the character tries to move up, it always ends up going down.</p>



<p>Then, with the reprise of the rising from the song&#8217;s beginning, there&#8217;s a ray of hope. A repetition of bars 19-21,  but again we return to a lower tone as if the character refuses to let go of his or her misery. Several times, hitting&nbsp;the same note, A.</p>



<p>We return to the main theme, always with the sadness of concluding on a lower tone than we began.</p>



<p>Here we begin a dialogue between hope and lament. Hope is a repetition of the preceding fast-rising, but this time it ascends to Db6, the highest note in all music. It&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s our character&#8217;s final hope, followed by a repeat of the first bar. Our character, on the other hand, gives up and plays the same notes for two bars.</p>



<p>Hopes responds by repeating the ascending to the highest tone. However, our character is slowly dying (the composer wrote the morendo in the score), with the semiquavers and crochets gradually fading to the low notes.</p>



<p>This composition struck me as very sad, and I believe that was the composer&#8217;s intention. Probably because of its history and all the stories he must have witnessed and experienced. Hovhaness was very familiar with the clarinet and its expressive possibilities (Wolverton, 2002), so it&#8217;s no surprise that this piece captures the melancholy and lament so beautifully.</p>



<p>As I previously stated, the clarinet has the ability to express human emotions, and when effectively crafted, it can feel as though there is a highly varied singer behind this instrument. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll remember this in my upcoming compositions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the composers with whom I most identify is Claude Debussy. So when I stumbled across this piece when researching pentatonic scale melodies, I knew I&#8217;d like it. I was not mistaken.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>My primary focus during this analysis will be on melody since that&#8217;s the component of the unit I&#8217;m studying.</p>



<p>This work, written by Claude Debussy between 1909 and 1910 for piano, was later transferred to a variety of other instruments.</p>



<p>The theme is introduced with a simple but lovely melodic line consisting entirely of Gb major pentatonic notes. I find this melody to be interesting because it ascends and descends in the pentatonic scale &#8212; in theory, that may sound boring, but it&#8217;s rather pleasing to listen to in this case.</p>



<p>The theme is then repeated, but instead of going up and down like the first time, we start descending the Gb scale in bar 10. This indicates that the music is going forward and not stuck in the same repetitive pattern, which should be uninteresting.</p>



<p>The work maintains its wave-like melody, but at bar 15, during one of the dramatic ascends, we switch to the Cb major pentatonic scale, reaching the highest note in the piece thus far. The melody then gradually descends in the Gb major scale, with the one quaver &#8211; two semiquavers that are so characteristic of this work, bringing familiarity and tranquillity to the music.</p>



<p>In bar 19, the score states &#8220;Un Peu Animé&#8221;, which I believe is the start of the song&#8217;s climax, where we ascend into three octaves in the scale of Eb Major and reach the highest note so far in the melody.</p>



<p>After the exhilaration of the finale, the primary theme returns, offering familiarity and security once more. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that this theme is a chord-based version of the familiar motif.</p>



<p>It all comes to a halt at bar 28 when the motif returns, but this time an octave higher. This gives the music a lot of tranquillity and a little dreaminess, in my opinion. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re reminiscing about how it all began. It&#8217;s also a little nostalgic.</p>



<p>In bar 33, we repeat bar 14, which brings us to the end of the song. The PP and minims make sure we reach a safe and stable conclusion.</p>



<p>Finally, I was drawn to this music since it is a singable melody that employs simple and common scales. This is the kind of melody I enjoy writing, and I&#8217;m hoping to get some inspiration from Debussy in Assignment 2.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C. This song from the eighteenth century piqued my curiosity, so I decided to investigate it more.</p>



<p>The lyrics are as follows, in their literal translation:</p>



<p>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>Sweet-smelling, beautiful, stems full of buds<br>Fragrant and white, everyone praises<br>Let me pluck you down<br>Give to someone else<br>Jasmine flower, oh jasmine flower</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When I first read this score, the slurs between two notes, going one tone up or down, gave it a very pleasant Chinese characteristic sound. It&#8217;s almost like a vocal slide that makes you feel either eager or peaceful depending on which direction you&#8217;re facing.</p>



<p>The song begins with a simple phrase that progresses from E to C, the song&#8217;s highest note, and then down to G. The song proceeds to a calmer section after the repetition of the first phrase, with mostly crochets and note repetition. It eventually descends to C, one octave lower than the highest C.</p>



<p>The last section is when the slur is used more frequently, most likely because the melody shifts from praising the jasmine blossom to taking it up and offering it to someone else. After ascending to the highest C, the song begins to descend to the lowest note, G. I believe the impression of falling down is achieved using this slurs going from E to lower G. It was strikingly beautiful to me.</p>



<p>I then went to Youtube to look for more versions of this song, and I came across this one by the Choir of St John&#8217;s College Cambridge, which I thought was the most fascinating arrangement.</p>
