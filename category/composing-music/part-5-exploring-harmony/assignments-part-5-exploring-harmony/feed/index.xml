<p>Since my tutor commented that the flute was unsupported by the piano in bar 31, I rewrote the piano to be even more minimalistic in order to create a dramatic point for the flute. This creates a great contrast between the previous and the following busy textures.</p>



<p>In regard to notation, I added a time signature, slurred the grace notes, and reviewed all accidentals, especially the B flats in the B-minor scale that should be A sharps.</p>



<p>With pedal markings, quaver and crochet sounded the same, so, as suggested by the tutor, I reviewed all the notes that had pedal markings to avoid over notating.</p>



<p>To emphasize the staccato sound of the C section, I added some articulation marks.</p>



<p>As the tutor pointed out, the chords were a bit heavy and muddy in bars 43-46. So, I softened the piano chords in those bars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In part 5 of this unit, I explored the role harmony plays in music. To put my research into practice, I composed some exercises to practise chord progressions. The result was that I gained a deeper understanding of how chord harmony supports a melody.</p>



<p>In part 4, I introduced chords through tuned percussion instruments; in part 5, I took it a step further with the piano. As a result, I was able to create a more complex and interesting sound, but it also posed some new challenges. For example, how to create chords that go beyond the simple triad or how to utilize arpeggios instead of chords to keep the sound moving.</p>



<p>In order to provide a fresh perspective to my listening log, my tutor suggested that I listen to contemporary classical music artists. My experience with this was quite interesting as I once again ventured outside of my comfort zone and discovered some inspiring artists.</p>



<h5 id="about-assignment-5" class="wp-block-heading">About Assignment 5</h5>



<p>So far, this was my favourite assignment. My ability to explore various sonorities and the introduction of the piano opened up many possibilities for me.</p>



<p>Even though I did not go far outside my comfort zone as I did in assignment four, I tried to create some familiar-sounding passages while adding some novel and unusual parts that I am not entirely sure are good.</p>



<p>The cyclic chord progression was useful in constructing the melody, and I used it five times with two different chord progressions.</p>



<p>In the previous parts of this unit, we&#8217;ve learned that if we modify or augment the same sounds, we can be more economical with the material. In this assignment, I tried to do this, and I was very pleased with the results.</p>



<p>Having reviewed all the assignments I completed, I can clearly see how my sense of rhythm and melody developed along with my confidence.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In assignment 5, I had to compose a piece that used Cyclic chord progressions at least four times&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In assignment 5, I had to compose a piece that used Cyclic chord progressions at least four times within a three-minute span. Although I could compose with any instruments of my choice, I was asked to avoid using a Perfect Cadence until the very end of the piece.</p>



<p>You can find the final score&nbsp;<a href="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-final-Full-Score.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-final-Full-Score.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and listen to it below:</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-idea-theme">The Idea / Theme</h2>



<p>I decided to use what I learned from my research on tango in this assignment and create a tango-inspired piece. The reason I would not call it a Tango is that I feel I need to dig deeper to find out what makes a memorable Tango piece, and mainly because I don&#8217;t want to offend tango lovers.</p>



<p>Additionally, I had fun playing with the element of surprise in my last assignment. Even though the use of cyclic chord progressions may mean repetition, I aim to include some unexpected elements in this piece to prevent it from becoming monotonous.</p>



<p>Regarding the theme, I believe that tango is much about passion and desire, so this piece is about love in all its forms. For instance, it can include passionate love, admiration for a friend, or care for a family member. All of these types of love have one thing in common: they are never linear. They have ups and downs, calm moments, passionate moments, turbulent moments. If it is true love, everything will finally make sense and end in a perfect cadence.</p>



<p>As with all relationships, both parties have unique personalities. Due to this, I chose two woodwind instruments (Flute and Oboe) with a narrator (Piano) to lead the listener through the piece.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-idea-theme"><span id="structure">Structure</span></h2>



<p>The structure is based on the concept that each voice has a chance to &#8220;speak&#8221; and then interact with the other voice. As a result, the structure becomes A-B-C-B&#8217;-A&#8217;, where A is dominated by the personality of the first voice, B is dominated by the personality of the second voice, and C is where they interact.</p>



<p>I selected the key of B minor for no particular reason other than it sounded good with a theme I was playing on the piano. Later in the C section, I wanted to modulate to the dominant key, in this case, F# minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section &amp; Triad</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The oboe presents itself as a more mellow and melodic voice</td><td>A &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~50 seconds at 75 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Flute enters with a more rhythm and fast-paced character</td><td>B &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~40 seconds at 95 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Their interactions are sometimes in harmony, but sometimes in discord</td><td>C &#8211; F# minor</td><td>~30 seconds at 80 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Despite their differences, they try to live together</td><td>B&#8217; &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~20 seconds at 75 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Talking about it in turns, they eventually arrive at a consensus</td><td>A&#8217; &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~30 seconds at 95 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-motifs">The Motifs</span></h2>



<p>From the beginning, I knew I wanted two motifs, one for the flute and one for the oboe. Each motif must be different and appear throughout the piece.</p>



<p>The oboe motif is more melodic and romantic, which I think is perfect for an oboe in the middle range.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="82" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1024x82.png" alt="" class="wp-image-651" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1024x82.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-300x24.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-768x62.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1536x123.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-2048x164.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-640x51.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-960x77.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The oboe and piano play a fraction of this motif in bars 29-30.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="339" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-1024x339.png" alt="" class="wp-image-652" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-1024x339.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-300x99.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-768x254.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-1536x509.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-2048x678.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-640x212.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-960x318.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>All instruments repeat this fraction in bars 62-66.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="824" height="1024" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-824x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-655" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-824x1024.png 824w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-242x300.png 242w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-768x954.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-1237x1536.png 1237w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-1649x2048.png 1649w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-300x373.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-640x795.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-960x1192.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>Unlike the first voice, the flute&#8217;s motif is mostly semiquavers and is more rhythmic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="291" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-1024x291.png" alt="" class="wp-image-654" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-1024x291.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-300x85.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-768x219.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-1536x437.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-2048x583.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-640x182.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-960x273.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>All instruments repeat this motif in bars 51-53.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="824" height="1024" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-824x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-656" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-824x1024.png 824w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-242x300.png 242w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-768x954.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-1237x1536.png 1237w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-1649x2048.png 1649w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-300x373.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-640x795.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-960x1192.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>This motif is augmented by the piano in bars 55-58.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="94" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-1024x94.png" alt="" class="wp-image-657" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-1024x94.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-300x27.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-768x70.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-1536x141.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-2048x188.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-640x59.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-960x88.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The piece also includes a note-descending motif that does not belong to any particular instrument and is played throughout in order to tie all sections together. It first appears in bars 5 and 6 on the oboe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="79" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-1024x79.png" alt="" class="wp-image-658" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-1024x79.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-300x23.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-768x59.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-1536x119.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-2048x158.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-640x50.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-960x74.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The flute plays a version of it in bars 22-23 and 28-29.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="100" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-1024x100.png" alt="" class="wp-image-659" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-1024x100.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-300x29.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-768x75.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-1536x151.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-2048x201.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-640x63.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-960x94.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Bars 22-23</figcaption></figure>

<p>The flute plays this motif in bars 33-34 (inside its own motif), but it has been slighlty transformed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="131" src="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-1024x131.png" alt="" class="wp-image-661" srcset="./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-1024x131.png 1024w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-300x38.png 300w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-768x98.png 768w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-1536x196.png 1536w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-2048x262.png 2048w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-640x82.png 640w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-960x123.png 960w, ./../../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In bars 58-59, the piano and flute repeat this motif.</p>

<p>Tango is much about rhythm, so I tried to convey it in this piece. As I found out in my research on tango, there are two distinct accompaniment rhythms: marcato and síncopa. Most of this piece uses síncopa, as for example at the beginning.</p>

<p>In Bars 17-20, as well as in Section C, the marcato is present.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-instruments">The Instruments</span></h2>



<p>I began to think about the piece at this point. We were told that we could use any instrument of our choice, but the hint was that we could use the piano as well. Because I had never composed for the piano before, I decided to research what woodwind instruments were used with the piano. I chose the piano &#8211; flute &#8211; oboe combination because I enjoyed listening to how the three instruments sound completely different in Madeleine Dring&#8217;s Trio for Flute, Oboe and Piano.</p>

<p>Upon hearing Lalliet&#8217;s Terzetto, I immediately thought of composing for the bassoon since it sounded very good with the oboe and piano. Then I realized several of my compositions have bassoons in them, so I decided to leave it out of this assignment.</p>

<p>This arrangement of Schumann&#8217;s 6 Studien in kanonischer Form, Op. 56: IV for oboe and piano was really interesting to listen to. I liked how the oboe suits the piano so well.</p>

<p>This performance of Jean-Michael Damase&#8217;s Trio caught my interest since I was curious to hear how the horn would sound in a three-piece ensemble. Although I have always considered the horn to be a beautiful instrument, here it sometimes sounded well, but in other instances it was too imposing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-composition">The Composition</span></h2>



<p><strong>Section A </strong>Bars 1-20</p>



<p>The first part of this section is dominated by the piano and the oboe, with the latter providing a more melodic voice. There&#8217;s something a bit romantic and a little cliché about this melody, giving me a gentle humming of Carlos Gardel&#8217;s voice. In order to convey that this is an inspired piece of tango music, I made this intentionally.</p>



<p>In this section, the chord progression is i &#8211; ii° &#8211; iv &#8211; III &#8211; VII⁶. I developed this progression because I wanted to begin with only minor chords and move to major chords in the last part.</p>



<p>This chord progression is broken up in a transition to the B section using a classic tango rhythm and letting the piano alone so the flute can enter more dramatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section B </strong>Bars 21-38</p>



<p>Bars 21-30 (the first ten bars) continue the previous transition with the introduction of the flute in a high E semibreve. A new chord progression is hinted at in bars 26-30, especially when the C major chord is introduced.</p>



<p>The flute&#8217;s motif is introduced with a new chord progression i &#8211; iv &#8211; ♮II &#8211; vi &#8211; V &#8211; VI from bar 31 to bar 34, which is repeated twice until the end of section B.</p>



<p>I wanted both rhythm and harmony to contrast in this section. Despite the fact that the piano uses essentially the same rhythm as section A, the flute uses mostly semiquavers. Harmonically, I introduce some non-diatonic chords that contrast feelings and surprise the listener.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section C </strong>Bars 39-50</p>



<p>In bars 39-42, I chose to take the contrast a step further with a brief modulation to the key of F# minor. Additionally, the rhythm changes to a marcato rhythm that is played throughout section C.</p>



<p>This section is more contrapuntal, where instruments play their own melodies and none of the previous motifs are heard, creating an impression that this is a completely new section.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section B&#8217; </strong>Bars 51-61</p>



<p>The piece returns to its familiarity in section B&#8217; with the previous chord progression i &#8211; iv &#8211; ♮II &#8211; vi &#8211; V &#8211; VI&nbsp;and interplay between instruments that echo a motif from section B. The climax is reached when both woodwind instruments play a high minim. That is the highest note played by the oboe so far.</p>



<p>A piano solo follows, and the piece moves back to a softer sound.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section A&#8217; </strong>Bars 62-68</p>



<p>The final section begins by mimicking the beginning of the B&#8217; section, in which the instruments play the motif of the A section in turn.</p>



<p>The voices calm down until there is a perfect cadence.</p>
