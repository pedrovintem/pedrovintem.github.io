<p>In this project, we were asked to improvise on a dominant, as long as it stayed interesting, until ending in a perfect cadence.</p>



<p>I aimed to make a longer composition, but I struggled to keep it interesting, so I chose to shorten it in order to not bore the listener.</p>



<p>This exercise is in the key of A major, making the dominant chord the E major. The left hand is always playing the E major chord, which turns into E major 7 on bar 5, and returns to E major on bar 7. Then, on bar 9, it plays an arpeggio of the E major and its inversions, until it reaches the final cadence, from E to A.</p>



<p>The right hand is more fluid and plays a melody that is much more interesting than the left hand repetition. I believe that this contrast makes interesting anticipation for the release of the tension on bar 15.</p>

<p>The aim of this project was to create four different V-I Cadences, each in a different key. Two of them were to be major and the other two minor.</p>



<p>&nbsp;For this exercise, we are asked to make four contrasting attempts at &#8216;dressing up&#8217; a perfect cadence, each in a different key, of which two should be major, and two minor. I was looking forward to attempting this exercise, as the theory is straightforward but there is lots of room for creativity.</p>



<h5 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h5>



<p>The first example is in the key of C major and is completely diatonic. I wanted to give some movement to this cadence, so the right hand is in a descending and ascending journey from G (V) to C(I), and there&#8217;s some syncopation in the left hand also. In the third bar, the V moves to a V7 just before ending in I. </p>

<h5 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h5>



<p>In this second exercise, I picked the A major key. I wanted to build tension in this exercise just before being released by the perfect cadence. This is achieved by going up in the right hand, while the left hand plays variations of the V and V7. After getting to a high D, the melody goes down until the perfect cadence V-I.</p>

<h5 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h5>



<p>This exercise is in the key of Eb minor. After composing this exercise, it sounded like Honegger&#8217;s piece I listened at the beginning of this unit. Here, I built up the cadence with right-hand arpeggios and with the left hand going through the notes of the Bb minor chord until the perfect cadence is achieved.</p>

<h5 id="exercise-4">Exercise 4</h5>



<p>This exercise is in the key of A minor, and has a very fast melody on top of a diatonic bassline. I think this exercise was inspired by my research on ragtime but with a really simple chord progression of I-V-I.</p>
