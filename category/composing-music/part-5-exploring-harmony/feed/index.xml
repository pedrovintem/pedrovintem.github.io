										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In part 5 of this unit, I explored the role harmony plays in music. To put my research into practice, I composed some exercises to practise chord progressions. The result was that I gained a deeper understanding of how chord harmony supports a melody.</p>



<p>In part 4, I introduced chords through tuned percussion instruments; in part 5, I took it a step further with the piano. As a result, I was able to create a more complex and interesting sound, but it also posed some new challenges. For example, how to create chords that go beyond the simple triad or how to utilize arpeggios instead of chords to keep the sound moving.</p>



<p>In order to provide a fresh perspective to my listening log, my tutor suggested that I listen to contemporary classical music artists. My experience with this was quite interesting as I once again ventured outside of my comfort zone and discovered some inspiring artists.</p>



<h5 id="about-assignment-5">About Assignment 5</h5>



<p>So far, this was my favourite assignment. My ability to explore various sonorities and the introduction of the piano opened up many possibilities for me.</p>



<p>Even though I did not go far outside my comfort zone as I did in assignment four, I tried to create some familiar-sounding passages while adding some novel and unusual parts that I am not entirely sure are good.</p>



<p>The cyclic chord progression was useful in constructing the melody, and I used it five times with two different chord progressions.</p>



<p>In the previous parts of this unit, we&#8217;ve learned that if we modify or augment the same sounds, we can be more economical with the material. In this assignment, I tried to do this, and I was very pleased with the results.</p>



<p>Having reviewed all the assignments I completed, I can clearly see how my sense of rhythm and melody developed along with my confidence.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In assignment 5, I had to compose a piece that used Cyclic chord progressions at least four times&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In assignment 5, I had to compose a piece that used Cyclic chord progressions at least four times within a three-minute span. Although I could compose with any instruments of my choice, I was asked to avoid using a Perfect Cadence until the very end of the piece.</p>



<p>You can find the final score <a href="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-final-Full-Score.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-final-Full-Score.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and listen to it below:</p>



<p></p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme">The Idea / Theme</h2>



<p>I decided to use what I learned from my research on tango in this assignment and create a tango-inspired piece. The reason I would not call it a Tango is that I feel I need to dig deeper to find out what makes a memorable Tango piece, and mainly because I don&#8217;t want to offend tango lovers.</p>



<p>Additionally, I had fun playing with the element of surprise in my last assignment. Even though the use of cyclic chord progressions may mean repetition, I aim to include some unexpected elements in this piece to prevent it from becoming monotonous.</p>



<p>Regarding the theme, I believe that tango is much about passion and desire, so this piece is about love in all its forms. For instance, it can include passionate love, admiration for a friend, or care for a family member. All of these types of love have one thing in common: they are never linear. They have ups and downs, calm moments, passionate moments, turbulent moments. If it is true love, everything will finally make sense and end in a perfect cadence.</p>



<p>As with all relationships, both parties have unique personalities. Due to this, I chose two woodwind instruments (Flute and Oboe) with a narrator (Piano) to lead the listener through the piece.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="structure">Structure</span></h2>



<p>The structure is based on the concept that each voice has a chance to &#8220;speak&#8221; and then interact with the other voice. As a result, the structure becomes A-B-C-B&#8217;-A&#8217;, where A is dominated by the personality of the first voice, B is dominated by the personality of the second voice, and C is where they interact.</p>



<p>I selected the key of B minor for no particular reason other than it sounded good with a theme I was playing on the piano. Later in the C section, I wanted to modulate to the dominant key, in this case, F# minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section &amp; Triad</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The oboe presents itself as a more mellow and melodic voice</td><td>A &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~50 seconds at 75 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Flute enters with a more rhythm and fast-paced character</td><td>B &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~40 seconds at 95 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Their interactions are sometimes in harmony, but sometimes in discord</td><td>C &#8211; F# minor</td><td>~30 seconds at 80 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Despite their differences, they try to live together</td><td>B&#8217; &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~20 seconds at 75 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Talking about it in turns, they eventually arrive at a consensus</td><td>A&#8217; &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~30 seconds at 95 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-motifs">The Motifs</span></h2>



<p>From the beginning, I knew I wanted two motifs, one for the flute and one for the oboe. Each motif must be different and appear throughout the piece.</p>



<p>The oboe motif is more melodic and romantic, which I think is perfect for an oboe in the middle range.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="82" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1024x82.png" alt="" class="wp-image-651" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1024x82.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-300x24.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-768x62.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1536x123.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-2048x164.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-640x51.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-960x77.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The oboe and piano play a fraction of this motif in bars 29-30.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="339" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-1024x339.png" alt="" class="wp-image-652" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-1024x339.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-300x99.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-768x254.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-1536x509.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-2048x678.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-640x212.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-960x318.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>All instruments repeat this fraction in bars 62-66.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="824" height="1024" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-824x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-655" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-824x1024.png 824w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-242x300.png 242w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-768x954.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-1237x1536.png 1237w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-1649x2048.png 1649w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-300x373.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-640x795.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-960x1192.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>Unlike the first voice, the flute&#8217;s motif is mostly semiquavers and is more rhythmic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="291" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-1024x291.png" alt="" class="wp-image-654" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-1024x291.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-300x85.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-768x219.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-1536x437.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-2048x583.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-640x182.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-960x273.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>All instruments repeat this motif in bars 51-53.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="824" height="1024" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-824x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-656" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-824x1024.png 824w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-242x300.png 242w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-768x954.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-1237x1536.png 1237w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-1649x2048.png 1649w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-300x373.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-640x795.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-960x1192.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>This motif is augmented by the piano in bars 55-58.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="94" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-1024x94.png" alt="" class="wp-image-657" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-1024x94.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-300x27.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-768x70.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-1536x141.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-2048x188.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-640x59.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-960x88.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The piece also includes a note-descending motif that does not belong to any particular instrument and is played throughout in order to tie all sections together. It first appears in bars 5 and 6 on the oboe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="79" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-1024x79.png" alt="" class="wp-image-658" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-1024x79.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-300x23.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-768x59.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-1536x119.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-2048x158.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-640x50.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-960x74.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The flute plays a version of it in bars 22-23 and 28-29.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="100" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-1024x100.png" alt="" class="wp-image-659" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-1024x100.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-300x29.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-768x75.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-1536x151.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-2048x201.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-640x63.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26-960x94.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-26.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Bars 22-23</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="111" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-1024x111.png" alt="" class="wp-image-660" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-1024x111.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-300x33.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-768x83.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-1536x167.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-2048x223.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-640x70.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27-960x104.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-27.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Bars 28-29</figcaption></figure>



<p>The flute plays this motif in bars 33-34 (inside its own motif), but it has been slighlty transformed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="131" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-1024x131.png" alt="" class="wp-image-661" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-1024x131.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-300x38.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-768x98.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-1536x196.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-2048x262.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-640x82.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-960x123.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In bars 58-59, the piano and flute repeat this motif.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="532" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-1024x532.png" alt="" class="wp-image-662" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-1024x532.png 1024w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-300x156.png 300w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-768x399.png 768w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-1536x798.png 1536w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-2048x1064.png 2048w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-640x332.png 640w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29-960x499.png 960w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-29.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-rhytms">The Rhytms</span></h2>



<p>Tango is much about rhythm, so I tried to convey it in this piece. As I found out in my research on tango, there are two distinct accompaniment rhythms: marcato and síncopa. Most of this piece uses síncopa, as for example at the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-instruments">The Instruments</span></h2>



<p>I began to think about the piece at this point. We were told that we could use any instrument of our choice, but the hint was that we could use the piano as well. Because I had never composed for the piano before, I decided to research what woodwind instruments were used with the piano. I chose the piano &#8211; flute &#8211; oboe combination because I enjoyed listening to it more.</p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-composition">The Composition</span></h2>



<p><strong>Section A </strong>Bars 1-20</p>



<p>The first part of this section is dominated by the piano and the oboe, with the latter providing a more melodic voice. There&#8217;s something a bit romantic and a little cliché about this melody, giving me a gentle humming of Carlos Gardel&#8217;s voice. In order to convey that this is an inspired piece of tango music, I made this intentionally.</p>



<p>In this section, the chord progression is i &#8211; ii° &#8211; iv &#8211; III &#8211; VII⁶. I developed this progression because I wanted to begin with only minor chords and move to major chords in the last part.</p>



<p>This chord progression is broken up in a transition to the B section using a classic tango rhythm and letting the piano alone so the flute can enter more dramatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section B </strong>Bars 21-38</p>



<p>Bars 21-30 (the first ten bars) continue the previous transition with the introduction of the flute in a high E semibreve. A new chord progression is hinted at in bars 26-30, especially when the C major chord is introduced.</p>



<p>The flute&#8217;s motif is introduced with a new chord progression i &#8211; iv &#8211; ♮II &#8211; vi &#8211; V &#8211; VI from bar 31 to bar 34, which is repeated twice until the end of section B.</p>



<p>I wanted both rhythm and harmony to contrast in this section. Despite the fact that the piano uses essentially the same rhythm as section A, the flute uses mostly semiquavers. Harmonically, I introduce some non-diatonic chords that contrast feelings and surprise the listener.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section C </strong>Bars 39-50</p>



<p>In bars 39-42, I chose to take the contrast a step further with a brief modulation to the key of F# minor. Additionally, the rhythm changes to a marcato rhythm that is played throughout section C.</p>



<p>This section is more contrapuntal, where instruments play their own melodies and none of the previous motifs are heard, creating an impression that this is a completely new section.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section B&#8217; </strong>Bars 51-61</p>



<p>The piece returns to its familiarity in section B&#8217; with the previous chord progression i &#8211; iv &#8211; ♮II &#8211; vi &#8211; V &#8211; VI&nbsp;and interplay between instruments that echo a motif from section B. The climax is reached when both woodwind instruments play a high minim. That is the highest note played by the oboe so far.</p>



<p>A piano solo follows, and the piece moves back to a softer sound.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section A&#8217; </strong>Bars 62-68</p>



<p>The final section begins by mimicking the beginning of the B&#8217; section, in which the instruments play the motif of the A section in turn.</p>



<p>The voices calm down until there is a perfect cadence.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I was challenged by my tutor to listen to more contemporary classical music in order to get a&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I was challenged by my tutor to listen to more contemporary classical music in order to get a sense of what they are preoccupied with. After reading that Kaija Saariaho is considered the greatest living composer by BBC Music Magazine (Fiilin, 2019) and that she has been named New York Times Composer of the Year 2021 (Barone, 2021), I chose her.</p>



<p>Having never heard Kaija Saariaho before, her sound was completely new to me.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">Kaija Saariaho, a Finnish composer born in 1952, studied composition at Sibelius Academy and then relocated to Germany to study at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg. Here she was frustrated by all the prohibited things in post-serialist tradition. “You were not allowed to have pulse, or tonally oriented harmonies, or melodies,” she said. “I don’t want to write music through negations. Everything is permissible as long as it’s done in good taste&#8221; (Posner, 2018).</p>



<p>Her first encounter with spectral music occurred in France in 1980, where she eventually settled. Throughout her career, her work has been marked by themes that have been circulating in French music for decades: melody and harmony derived from overtones, and the blending of instrumental and electronic sounds. Her involvement with Pierre Boulez&#8217;s electronic music institute, IRCAM, which he founded in 1977, is extensive (Ross, 2006).</p>



<p>Like Saariaho in 1980, I had never come into contact with spectralism. I found it to be a different approach to music, using overtones to examine sonorities, although it isn&#8217;t something completely novel, in terms of music theory. Western music is built on the building blocks of the overtone series &#8211; the octave, the fourth, the fifth, and the major third. The beauty of this music comes from how the different instruments explore and use these overtones while not becoming dull and boring. </p>



<p>I chose Vista because it is a composition from 2021, and I was curious about what a great composer is working on at the moment. I found this recording of Helsinki City Orchestra and Susanna Mälkki conducting.</p>



<div class="yle_areena_player" data-id="1-50946353"></div><script src="https://player-v2.yle.fi/embed.js" defer></script>



<p>Music has always seemed to me like motion, such as a slice of life that the composer is imagining or a scene from a film that is transcribed into music. But what I found with Saariaho was that music can be compared to a picture. A still moment in time can be described with all the acoustic nuances creating what I believe could be a musical photograph.  </p>



<p>Vista gave me the impression that this was a scene that the composer observeimagined. She is describing it to the listener what it is and how it made her feel.</p>



<p>In Horizons, the scene is a really open one, perhaps a field or the sea. Something she couldn&#8217;t see the end of, perhaps a very flat landscape. The scenery is peaceful, giving you time to take in nature&#8217;s beauty. I would love to see some paintings based on Horizons.</p>



<p>Targets is a completely different landscape, although it uses the same instruments from the previous piece. It is rough, dry, and tumultuous. It feels like this is a mountainous landscape, with sharp geometry everywhere you look. It&#8217;s not prettier or uglier than the landscape in Horizons, but it&#8217;s not a calm place either. Maybe it&#8217;s near the city and you feel the stress coming in.</p>



<p>Vista opened up a new musical world for me, so I enjoyed listening to it. Another great thing about this work is the score, which I found particularly interesting because of the notation for the players and how detailed it was.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In researching Ragtime, I discovered this music style resembled Tango in some ways. As it turns out, ragtime&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In researching Ragtime, I discovered this music style resembled Tango in some ways. As it turns out, ragtime and tango share some rhythmic styles, such as bass syncopation (Berlin, 2013).</p>



<p>As a result, I learned more about Tango and one of its greatest composers: Astor Piazzolla.</p>



<p>Although I had heard Piazzolla before, I hadn&#8217;t listened to his Four Seasons work. Consequently, I decided to listen to it.</p>



<p>Piazzolla was born in Mar del Plata, Argentina, on March 11, 1921. When he was eight years old, his family moved to New York, USA, from where he got his first bandoneon before moving back to Argentina and then again to the USA. As a result of all of this back and forth between Argentina and the US, he was influenced by Tango and Jazz in all of his work (Bach, 1991).</p>



<p>As a 12-year-old, he was already a prolific bandoneon player, until he met Carlos Gardel, one of his idols. He eventually became Gardel&#8217;s translator and bandoneon player as well.</p>



<p>In 1946, Piazzolla moved back to Argentina and formed his own orchestra. He then travelled to France for a Paris Conservatory scholarship. However, his secret goal on this trip to France was to meet Nadia Boulanger, one of the greatest music teachers to ever live (Burton-Hill, 2017). In response to a symphony he composed, she gave him some great advice:&nbsp;&#8220;Something is missing You sound like Ravel, Bartok, Stravinsky, Hindemith but you don&#8217;t sound like Piazzolla. Where is Astor Piazzolla in all this? What do you do!&#8221; (Bach, 1991).</p>



<p>Nadia Boulanger encouraged Piazzolla to pursue what would become known as the New Tango, a unique fusion of tango, jazz, and classical music. His favourite instruments for tango nuevo were the bandoneon, violin, bass, piano, and electric guitar.</p>



<p>I can hear all of these influences in his Buenos Aires Four Seasons, or in the original title Las Cuatro Estaciones Porteñas.</p>



<p>As opposed to Vivaldi&#8217;s Four Seasons, Piazzolla treated the four pieces separately rather than as a single suite. The summer was written in 1965, the winter in 1969, and the spring and autumn in 1970. However, he sometimes performed them together in concerts. In this composition, the four seasons are presented with the focus on Buenos Aires, meaning that each season is seen and heard through the eyes and ears of a city bursting with life and activity.</p>



<p>In 1998, Leonid Desyatnikov composed a new arrangement linked to Vivaldi&#8217;s work for solo violin and string orchestra. Instead of listening to this arrangement, I will listen to the original bandoneon arrangement played by Piazzolla.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Astor Piazzolla - Las cuatro estaciones porteñas (Compilado)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6Jv_JrjJIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>It was generally very enjoyable, particularly the contrast between energetic and almost chaotic forces and subtle and gentle melodies. All of the &#8220;seasons&#8221; follow some kind of fast-slow-fast pattern, which makes them feel very different from what traditional tango used to be.</p>



<p>In traditional tango, the time signature is 4/4 and there are two simple rhythms: marcato, where there are four marks on the beat; and síncopa, where there is an off-beat pattern that includes a number of variations like the most famous Habanera. In Piazzolla&#8217;s&nbsp;Las Cuatro Estaciones Porteñas, I can hear both rhythms but particularly Autumn has a very interesting habanera rhythm.</p>



<p><strong>Spring</strong></p>



<p>The city is waking up from a rainy winter and moving towards sunny days in the spring. In a way, spring is the beginning of life. This is especially evident in this piece where the violin makes a sound that sounds almost like a shout of joy, at mark 01:00. People start moving out of their houses and partying on the streets.</p>



<p>Around 02:30, the calmer part begins and I believe this is a time for romance. As the Spring lovers appear and the seduction begins, Piazzolla demonstrates that Tango is not just about the party and energetic rhythms, it can also be about beautiful and tranquil melodies.</p>



<p>We return to the energetic motif at 03:20 because spring is about letting go of all the tension accumulated during the winter and enjoying the wonderful weather outside.</p>



<p><strong>Summer</strong></p>



<p>Summer in Buenos Aires is extremely hot, making it difficult to spend time outside during the day. I believe that&#8217;s why this piece is not as energetic as Spring. There is some repetition within the melody itself because that is what the heat does to you. Everything becomes more lethargic. The joy returns in the late afternoon and evening. During mark 09:30, we hear the same shouts of joy as in the Spring piece, as well as a hint of celebration and romance.</p>



<p>Piazzolla&#8217;s violin solo brings back the lethargy of the very hot and humid summer of Buenos Aires because perhaps in his mind the daytime has returned.</p>



<p>The joy returns at the end with a bit of joy and síncopa to help bring about a festive mood with the end of summer and colder days to come.</p>



<p><strong>Autumn</strong></p>



<p>While spring is the season for birth, Autumn brings a sense of death and tranquillity. Particularly at mark 17:00, the previous violin shouts have less power and sound almost sad. It brings melancholy to our ears with the nostalgia of spring and summer and the anticipation of a cold winter that comes slowly to us. I feel that by the end of this piece. There are huge, heavy steps of coming winter.</p>



<p><strong>Winter</strong></p>



<p>During the winter, the city moves indoors. Because everything is a little calmer and colder, the tango sounds a little warmer as if it could warm the heart of the dancers. In this piece, I believe Piazzolla envisioned couples dancing close to each other to this tango in order to warm each other and maybe have a little romance in the winter.</p>



<p>The electric guitar sound is quite dominant in this piece, which I believe is meant to emphasize the warm sound needed for the cold winter, just like a musical fireplace.</p>



<p>In the second half, the music starts to gain energy, probably trying to make the anticipation of the Spring to come.</p>



<p>Around mark 26:00, the sound shifts into classical, perhaps a nod to Vivaldi&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>Because of my research on Cadenza, I ended up listening to Beethoven&#8217;s Piano Concerto No. 5, specially the first movement Allegro. In my opinion, this concerto is a perfect example of Beethoven&#8217;s ability to infuse rhythm, depth a power into music. </p>



<p>This first movement starts with a rather unusual presentation of the orchestra and the solo instrument, in this case the piano. The orchestra plays open chords while the piano plays  flourishes of arpeggios, trills, and scales.</p>



<p>Then comes the theme, which in my opinion is a very powerful and almost a fanfare. </p>

<p>The development shows all the creative genius of Beethoven, who created a stunning piece that contains a repeating themes and different elaborations of them by both the orchestra and the piano. </p>



<p>One thing I found interesting is the duality of the piano &#8211; orchestra, because from my listening I think that the piano is more experimental and spontaneous, while the orchestra tends to stay more predictable and harmonious. I believe this was a deliberate thought of Beethoven to create some tension and interest in this 20 minute movement.</p>



<p>The cadenza of Piano Concerto No. 5 a.k.a. Emperor Concerto is a very short part of this piece and it was written by Beethoven, probably because he was unable to perform it and wanted to control all the narrative of this concerto. Following this Emperor Concerto, writing the cadenzas became a common feature among contemporary composers (Lindeman, 1995).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the things I&#8217;m finding most interesting in this course is that I&#8217;m putting names and concepts in things I loved about music. It happened with counterpoint and it happened now with cadenza.</p>



<p>Cadenza is, according to The Oxford Dictionary of Music, &#8220;a flourish (properly, improvised) inserted into the final cadence of any section of a vocal aria or a solo instr movement&#8221; (Kennedy, Kennedy and Rutherford-Johnson, 2012). This music usually culminates in an extended trill, after which the orchestra re-enters, bringing the movement to a speedy conclusion, more often than not without any further participation from the soloist.</p>



<p>The practice of cadenzas originated in vocal music where singers improvised at certain cadences within an aria. The general rule for vocal music was that the cadenza would last no longer than a breath. Composers preferred that performers keep their cadenzas short to prevent interference with the structure of the aria. Since Mozart and Beethoven were writing for their own performances, they felt no inclination to keep things and took this opportunity to show their flashy keyboard skills (Fuller, n.d.).</p>



<p> In other words, it can be described as a parenthesis in music, where the author (in the case of a written cadenza) or the player (in the case of an improvised cadenza) take the liberty of getting out of the structure of the music and create a new focal point of the piece  (Bribitzer-Stull, Matthew, 2006).</p>



<p>After hearing some cadenzas (shown below) I believe that the cadenza has two main purposes: one in itself and the other within the piece. The first is to showcase the singer/player skills; the second is to anticipate a climactic ending. </p>



<p>Going back to the beginning of this post, now I know what Freddie Mercury (one of my favourite composers) was doing when, for example, he used a little cadenza at the end of Barcelona (at minute 3:50) or a slightly bigger one at the end of the live performance of Somebody To Love (at minute 5:00). In both examples, he was showcasing the vocal skills of the singer (Montserrat Caballé&#8217;s skill in the first example, which can be thought of a melisma) and leading the music into an apotheotic ending. </p>

<p>Maybe there are other examples of cadenzas in more popular music, but I can&#8217;t find them. Below are the classical examples I listened to.</p>



<h5 id="wolfgang-amadeus-mozart-piano-concerto-no-20-in-d-minor-k-466-mvt-1-allegro">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart &#8211; Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466. Mvt. 1: Allegro</h5>

<p>This is one of the most cited cadenzas I found through all articles I read. Probably because it joins the work of two geniouses: Mozart&#8217;s concerto and Beethoven&#8217;s cadenza. Mozart&#8217;s Piano Concerto was given its premiere in Vienna on 1785, with the composer at the piano, but sadly, Mozart&#8217;s own cadenza was lost. A few years later in 1809, Beethoven wrote his own. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s full of contrasts and unexpected twists and turns and a fantastic final stretched with a trill that lasts several bars before the orchestra comes in. I was expecting a more virtuosic challenge for the pianist, but what I believe Beethoven achieved was a more emotional and impassioned cadenza.</p>



<h5 id="beethoven-piano-concerto-no-5-in-e-flat-major-op-73">Beethoven &#8211; Piano Concerto No. 5 in E flat major op. 73</h5>

<p>This cadenza that appears near the end of the first movement, was written by the composer itself and it is a really short but elaborate part of this piece. What I found interesting about this cadenza is that it fits the whole movement very well. It comes from the main theme and makes the passage to another theme.</p>



<p>Before the cadenza, the orchestra plays the powerful dotted quaver &#8211; semi quaver &#8211; crochet chords while the piano anticipates a bit of the cadenza. Then the short cadenza starts full of rhythm but then gently eases back into the tutti by accompanying the end of the “cadenza” with a horn theme. </p>



<h5 id="brahms-violin-concerto-in-d-major-op-77">Brahms &#8211; Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 77</h5>

<p>Brahms wrote one violin concerto and it was dedicated to Joseph Joachim. The cadenza appears in the end of Mvt.1 and I believe it is full of passion and melancholy at the same time. It explores the violin capabilites, which fits the purpose of a cadenza: to showcase the player&#8217;s and instrument virtuosities.</p>



<p>The dissonant notes and the strikes on the chords convey a bit of rage that I specially aprecciate. With the runs, I felt that it had some rock and metal sound I used to listen to. It brought me memories of the extended electric guitar solos that showcased the guitarist skills.</p>



<p>In the end, the entering of the orchestra is much smoother than the Mozart&#8217;s piano concerto, and I believe this creates a great contrast with the cadenza, almost like it is a resolution of the violin&#8217;s anger.</p>
