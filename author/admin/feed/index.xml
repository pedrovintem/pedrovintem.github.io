										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Studying Part Three was a real mix of feelings for me. </p>



<p>I love the Romantic era in music – it’s my favourite. Especially because I like seeing how history has shaped today&#8217;s music and this era was particularly impactful in today&#8217;s music. During the Romantic era, people started to see musicians as heroes which is reflected in today&#8217;s famous artists. Music and songs became a way for them to share deep feelings. I also enjoyed learning about how music started to reach more people, making it easier for regular folks to enjoy and play. It was a time for the democratisation of music. </p>



<p>The exploration of Romantic-era music ignited this fascination with the concept of musical evolution. How composers drew inspiration from their predecessors, adapted styles to suit their creative vision, and eventually paved the way for new musical forms was truly inspiring.</p>



<p>But, even though I liked studying this period in music, I also missed doing the compositional part of my course: writing and making music is what excites me. That hands-on part is something I look forward to and wish I had more of now.</p>



<p>Similar to my experience with the previous parts of my learning, I encountered challenges in managing my time effectively. However, the support and guidance from my tutor played a great role in keeping me motivated and determined to make progress, no matter how slow it may have seemed. I&#8217;ve come to realize that the journey of learning is not always about speed, but about the steady and dedicated progress one makes, regardless of the pace.</p>



<p>One part I feel good about is my assignment on how pianos changed in the Romantic era. I spent a lot of time researching and it paid off. I wrote a well-structured text that shows how the piano became key to all kinds of music.</p>



<p>Despite the challenges, I felt a sense of accomplishment as I progressed through Part Three. The time and effort invested were worth it, as I had gained a deeper understanding of the Nineteenth century&#8217;s music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lately, I’ve been interested in the piano as a player and listener. Therefore, I decided to research its development during the Romantic era. A new emphasis on powerful emotion, individualism and expressiveness in the arts characterised this period. As opposed to the reason and order valued during the Enlightenment, Romantic artists sought to explore the full range of human emotion and experience. Music was profoundly impacted by this philosophical shift, with composers experimenting with passionate, dramatic works to evoke strong sentiments from audiences. The piano emerged during this period as a revolutionary instrument that epitomised the Romantic spirit.</p>



<p>Gill Green&#8217;s &#8220;History of Piano Tuning&#8221; (2020) discusses the nineteenth-century upheaval and innovation in the piano industry, highlighting the rapid advancements during that time. The main innovation was the ability of this instrument to vary tone and volume based on touch, unlike the fixed volume of the harpsichord. Implementing metal and heavier wooden frames allowed for increased string tension and enhanced the piano&#8217;s capacity for thunderous fortissimo and delicate pianissimo voicings. The new double escapement action enabled rapid repeated notes through its responsive key return and hammer resetting mechanisms. Also, the expanded keyboard range of over seven octaves permitted a wider spectrum of tonal colour.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the new piano&#8217;s capabilities made the Romantic era paying audiences, especially the middle class, captivated by its ability to channel profound personal expression. This demand fuelled the prominence of new miniature genres and forms such as short piano compositions which perfectly showcased the piano&#8217;s expressive versatility.</p>



<p>Conversely, composers started exploiting the piano&#8217;s rich harmonies, creating melodies and dynamic gradations to conjure passion, conflict, intimacy and all shades of Romantic experience.</p>



<p>For example, Chopin&#8217;s nocturnes, such as his famous Nocturne Op. 9 No.2, spotlight the instrument&#8217;s singing lyricism and range of colouristic voicings to evoke moods from brooding melancholy to gentle bliss. Also, his études and preludes for solo piano, the Prelude Op. 28, no. 4 in E minor and no. 20 in C minor being two great examples for me, capturing shifting qualities of emotion through intense passages and lyrical melodies.  Chopin brought the bel canto to the piano, redefining its expressive capabilities and influencing generations of pianists and composers to come. </p>



<p>The piano&#8217;s expanding expressive powers also began to influence the sound and direction of Romantic orchestral music. No longer confined to a supporting continuo role, the piano emerged as a prominent solo voice within the rich orchestral texture, providing a contrasting intimate quality. Composers increasingly incorporated the piano as a soloist in concertos and symphonic works, juxtaposing its unique timbre and dynamic fluctuations against the grand orchestral forces.</p>



<p>For example, Brahms’ Second Piano Concerto integrates the solo piano part as an equal partner in dialogue with the orchestra, accompanying or contrasting with its passages. The most beautiful parts are when the piano adds a dimension of lyrical sensitivity and virtuosity to balance the orchestra&#8217;s imposing, expansive passages. Similarly, Tchaikovsky’s First Piano Concerto exploits the piano&#8217;s capacity for thunderous bravura and whisper-soft poeticism, especially in the third movement. It transitions from soft, to playful, to a raging force, enlivening the dramatic trajectory of the piece.</p>



<p>The piano&#8217;s small size and versatility had a significant impact backstage and may have contributed to the development of large-scale works such as ballet. According to Parakilas (1999), the rehearsal of operas, ballets, oratorios, orchestral works, and masses, was greatly influenced by the piano, as one instrument could stand in for an entire orchestra during rehearsals. This allowed singers, dancers, and solo performers to practice more affordably and efficiently.</p>



<p>The piano provided an ideal creative canvas for Romantic composers to explore new musical forms that departed from Classical norms. Short and personal forms emerged during the Romantic era as vehicles for piano solo composition such as rhapsody, nocturne, and song cycle. They all showcased the composer as well as the pianist’s virtuosity. Audiences were drawn to the drama and excitement of watching pianists conquer seemingly impossible passages and spark deep emotions through their playing. The spectacle of the virtuoso at the keyboard cultivated a “cult of genius” surrounding renowned pianist-composers. Their impassioned expressions of Romanticism struck a chord with middle-class audiences, who saw these artists as visionaries unveiling profound truths through music.</p>



<p>Liszt in particular cultivated an ultra-Romantic ideal of meritocracy, encapsulated in his quote “My talent ennobles me,” as noted by Greenberg (2013) in his analysis of Romantic era composers. Liszt became a hugely famous star, admired by audiences for his virtuosic piano skills. The poet Heinrich Heine coined the term &#8220;Lisztomania&#8221; to describe the frenzy surrounding Liszt&#8217;s celebrity and performances, which were known for dazzling technical displays. His prowess at the piano made him an iconic embodiment of the Romantic ethos of the artist-hero. His Piano Sonata in B Minor showcases how he could compose extremely technically demanding passages, pushing the boundaries of what was considered possible on the piano.</p>



<p>In addition to Liszt&#8217;s virtuosity, Clara Schumann, one of the female pianists to enjoy acclaim during this male-dominated era, set new standards for performance by playing recitals and concertos from memory, being a skilled improviser who brought creativity to her performances, and promoting contemporary composers like her husband Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms.</p>



<p>Character pieces for piano also flourished during the Romantic period. These brief works captured a single mood, place, person or situation through music. Titles like Chopin’s “Raindrop” Prelude, Mendelssohn’s “Song Without Words” and Schumann’s “Scenes from Childhood” gave clues to the miniatures’ poetic aims. This genre allowed experimentation with new harmonies, textures and forms within a condensed timeframe ranging from just one to ten minutes in length typically.</p>



<p>The condensed scope, alongside the small size of the piano and the development of publishing, made character pieces quite accessible to amateur pianists. These short piano works proliferated in musical salons and amateur recitals alongside the more ambitious sonatas and concertos aimed at virtuoso performers. Even complex programmatic cycles like Schumann’s Carnaval incorporated character pieces as movements. The character piece&#8217;s brevity and focus suited the more casual playing of non-professionals in home settings. With the rise of sheet music distribution, amateurs could readily acquire these bite-sized impressionistic works to perform for their own enjoyment or for small gatherings of friends and family.</p>



<p>This also led to the development of art songs, with composers sometimes organising songs with similar themes into collections called song cycles. Schubert notably created song cycles like “The Fair Maid of the Mill” and “Winter Journey,” based on the poems of German poet Muller, both evoking feelings of sadness.</p>



<p>As the piano became more accessible, art songs became a popular genre for home music-making, providing women in the 19th century a unique opportunity. This led to an increase in compositions by women composers, unprecedented in previous centuries, resulting in their rise to fame. Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, for example, composed about 500 musical pieces, including approximately 120 for piano and many art songs (Lieder), such as the elegant piece “Warum sind den die Rosen so blass.”</p>



<p>By cultivating these innovative genres for solo piano, Romantic composers ensured the instrument remained at the heart of mainstream middle-class musical culture. Whether expressed through compact character sketches or sprawling sonata structures, the piano gave Romantic composers their ideal canvas to paint bold new musical narratives filled with drama, poetry and intimacy previously unexplored in past eras. </p>



<p>The instrument shaped both listening habits and amateur music-making for generations to come. Its influence has been so profound that it is now the only instrument that features across all popular Western musical genres, including jazz, hip-hop, EDM, and rock.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As one of Chopin&#8217;s most famous piano works, I&#8217;ve heard this lovely Nocturne many times before but listened to it closely again recently. True to the nocturne style, it&#8217;s a short, simple piece with a straightforward structure centred on a lovely, almost naive melody that is instantly accessible and deeply romantic. The focus is absolutely on the long-lined vocal quality of the melody rather than complex harmonies, which remain mostly diatonic throughout. </p>



<p>While there&#8217;s not much harmonic tension, the interest comes from Chopin&#8217;s ornamentation that showcases the piano&#8217;s ability to quickly change notes, including trills, turns, and appoggiaturas. Despite its simplicity, or perhaps because of it, this nocturne is profoundly emotional to me. The famous melody is so classically romantic and intimate, that it&#8217;s no wonder it has moved listeners for almost 200 years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is probably my favourite Chopin piece and one of my all-time favourite piano works. The sheer amount of emotion Chopin packs into this short and simple prelude never ceases to amaze me. It feels heavy, deep, and lamenting &#8211; almost like a funeral march. The constant, heartbeat-like rhythm creates a dark and brooding atmosphere, especially when combined with the descending harmonic progression that forms the backdrop of the piece.</p>



<p>There is barely any melody to speak of, just a simple descending scale figure that is repeated and varied. Yet despite its simplicity, the melody is incredibly lyrical and sings with a beautiful, melancholic tone. In this relatively basic musical texture, Chopin captures something raw and overwhelmingly human.</p>



<p>The ending is my favourite part &#8211; the way Chopin delays the final cadence builds the tension to almost unbearable levels before resolving. That tragic, delayed resolution encapsulates the mournful and evocative nature of this stunning prelude.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When I listened to Yuja Wang&#8217;s performance of this concerto, I was drawn into a musical conversation. The piano starts quietly, making small talk with the orchestra. But soon it shows a bold personality, interrupting the orchestra strongly.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s something remarkably compelling when the piano interrupts the orchestra. It&#8217;s like the small piano is shouting against the group. These interruptions give the concerto a sense of struggle and triumph that adds to the piece&#8217;s drama.</p>



<p>Sometimes it sounds like the piano and orchestra are having a dynamic conversation, taking turns. Other times they angrily argue, competing for attention. This conversation keeps changing from calm to passionate. The piano brings thoughtful melody and skill, balancing the orchestra&#8217;s powerful sections.</p>



<p>In the second movement, the dramatic piano storms against the mellow orchestra. The orchestra sometimes responds mildly, creating a vivid contrast that heightens the overall excitement of the movement.</p>



<p>The gentle third movement has a flowing lyricism, with the cello spinning a beautiful song. This movement is rich and sumptuous. It&#8217;s a peaceful contrast from all the arguments before.</p>



<p>But it is the final movement that leaves an indelible mark. Here, the piano shifts from gracious to loud and forceful. The piano showcases its full range of expression. This movement captures the whole spirit of the concerto &#8211; starting peacefully and ending spectacularly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Listening to Schumann&#8217;s Carnaval, took me into a grand masquerade, where masked partygoers come together to celebrate the festivities of Carnival. Even Chopin appeared at this fictitious party. This piano suite, composed between 1834 and 1835, consists of 21 short movements, each representing a character or caricature from the carnival scene.</p>



<p>Schumann turned this piece into a storytelling breathing life into the characters. Pierrot, the sad clown, dances poignantly, while Harlequin, the mischievous trickster, bounds with infectious energy.</p>



<p>At times, the technical challenges posed by Carnaval seemed daunting, even overwhelming. Yet as I studied the piece more deeply, I developed a greater understanding of Schumann&#8217;s composition. Learning about his mental health struggles and how they may have shaped this music gave me new insight. I realized that the complex and shifting emotions woven throughout Carnaval serve to enhance its overall poignant effect. Every musical detail—each note, chord, melodic twist and turn—contributes to this emotional impact.</p>



<p>It is not the kind of work that I would love to listen to repeatedly. Still, I get the sense that it is a work that is important to establish the piano as an extremely expressive instrument and will continue to captivate listeners.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Wagner&#8217;s dramatic and emotionally charged music has long had a powerful influence not just on music lovers, but&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Wagner&#8217;s dramatic and emotionally charged music has long had a powerful influence not just on music lovers, but also on political movements seeking a sense of mythic destiny. This mystical attraction of music was and still is used by political propaganda and proved fatally potent when adopted by Hitler and the Nazis. But does Wagner&#8217;s music itself contain some intrinsic quality that made it the perfect vehicle for Nazism?</p>



<p>There is no doubt that Wagner had an anti-Semitic view of the world. In his notorious 1850 essay &#8220;On Judaism in Music,&#8221; Wagner expressed extremely offensive racist views towards Jewish people that were later exploited by the Nazis. He stereotyped Jews and said they could not truly make great art. Though a distortion, Hitler and other Nazis admired Wagner and saw him as an inspiration for their antisemitism.</p>



<p>I believe that there are aspects of Wagner&#8217;s works that undoubtedly appealed to the Nazi psyche. The huge mythical operas about heroes and gods match the Nazis&#8217; huge self-glorification. The medieval German settings and Norse mythology in works like The Ring suit the Nazi love of old Germanic purity.</p>



<p>The raw emotion in Wagner&#8217;s scores, for example, the extreme excitement when the music climaxes, is like the fevered Nazi rallies choreographed by Hitler and Goebbels. The gut power of songs like The Ride of the Valkyries taps into wild passions that override morality – just what the Nazis did so well.</p>



<p>Yet we must be aware of overstating this case. While Wagner&#8217;s operas worked well for the Nazis, the music itself isn&#8217;t Fascist. I couldn&#8217;t find information showing that there is anything intrinsically Fascist about the music itself. The emotional range of Wagner&#8217;s scores captures the full spectrum of human experience—from the uplifting to the disturbing. As with all art, his works are open to multiple interpretations.</p>



<p>I firmly believe that art and the artist should be separated and appreciated independently. Wagner&#8217;s music is no exception. We can still find value in his compositions while acknowledging the problematic aspects of the composer as an individual. We can reclaim his works for more positive purposes – his music leading us to contemplate humanity&#8217;s deeper bonds rather than divisions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A few days ago, I attended the Mozart Requiem concert performed by the Orquestra Filarmónica Portuguesa at the Aula Magna in Lisbon. The concert was conducted by the conductor Osvaldo Ferreira and featured a choir and four soloists: Marco Alves dos Santos, tenor, Carolina Figueiredo, mezzo-soprano, Raquel Alão, soprano and Miguel Maduro-Dias, bass.</p>



<p>The performance of Mozart&#8217;s Requiem by the Orquestra Filarmónica Portuguesa was a sublime and moving experience. The full orchestra, choir, and four solo vocalists brought Mozart&#8217;s immortal composition to life in a profound way.</p>



<p>The instruments used included the typical setup found in a classical orchestra &#8211; strings, woodwinds, brass and timpani. The strings provided the lush foundation, while the winds and brass added color and accent. The timpani gave dramatic punctuation while the four vocal soloists gave the Requiem an operatic quality during their featured parts.</p>



<p>While the Requiem is a familiar and often performed piece, hearing it live gave it an emotional immediacy and power beyond any recording. The soaring crescendos and hushed moments of silence resonated deeply. No media reproduction can truly capture the experience of hearing these sublime sounds &#8220;in the flesh.&#8221;</p>



<p>The program notes provided useful background and context about the piece and its history that enhanced my enjoyment and understanding. Learning about the mysterious circumstances of the Requiem&#8217;s composition and its intersection of the earthly and divine added deeper meaning.</p>



<p>Overall, this was a profoundly enjoyable and moving concert that will stay with me for a long time. I had never heard Mozart’s Requiem live before, and I was surprised by the difference it makes. I felt that the music had more life, more intensity, more depth. I could perceive the details, the nuances, the emotions of the musicians and the singers. I also felt more involved, more connected, more participant of the work. </p>

<p>I listened to Glenn Gould&#8217;s 1968 recording.</p>



<p>The most evident difference between Beethoven&#8217;s original and Liszt&#8217;s transcription is the instrumentation. Beethoven&#8217;s composition, created for a full orchestra, provides a vast palette of colours, timbres, and effects, allowing the music to be expressed with expansive variety.</p>



<p>In contrast, Liszt&#8217;s transcription scored solely for piano, introduces intrinsic physical constraints evident in the performance: The range and depth of sounds are not as broad as those produced by an orchestra; a piano&#8217;s sustained notes fall short when compared to those of wind or string instruments; and while dynamic contrasts can be substantial, they typically do not reach the extremes possible within an orchestra, even though the version I listened to did had significant dynamic variation.</p>



<p>However, there is a distinctive positive aspect to Liszt&#8217;s arrangement: intimacy. A single instrument, managed by one performer, transforms a grand, collective work into a more personal and individual experience. The piano takes the spotlight and, particularly during the Romantic era, places the pianist at the forefront. A single instrument offers performers greater liberty and room for expression; they can shape the tempo, articulation, and pedalling, ultimately making the performance a personal statement of the player&#8217;s own style.</p>



<p>I believe that Liszt’s piano version captures a lot of the spirit of the symphony, following the same structure and themes as Beethoven’s original. Liszt also tries to evoke the same feelings and moods, like tension, drama, contrast, and resolution. It’s not just a copy, but a new interpretation that honours Beethoven’s talent.</p>



<p>Regarding my preference, I found merit in listening to both versions, as they provide distinct interpretations of the same composition. However, if I had to pick one, I&#8217;d go with Beethoven’s original symphony. I feel it embodies the music&#8217;s essence more authentically and powerfully. I also appreciate Beethoven&#8217;s skill in balancing and contrasting various sections, themes, and instruments, as well as the way he develops and resolves musical ideas.</p>

<p>Listening to Albéniz&#8217;s &#8220;Suite Española No. 1&#8221;, I was immediately drawn to the piece &#8220;Asturias (Leyenda)&#8221; for its familiar Spanish elements. As a Portuguese listener, I found parallels to music from my own country.</p>



<p>The piano mimics a Spanish guitar, reflecting the central role of the guitar in Spanish musical culture. Repeated rhythmic strumming patterns capture the spirit of Spanish folk music traditions.</p>



<p>An insistent flamenco rhythm drives the piece forward, evoking the heel-taps of dancers. The struck chords suggest the clapping hands often accompanying flamenco.</p>



<p>The melody itself encapsulates Spanish folk idioms with its modal tonality and distinctive phrasing. This is the very essence of Iberian traditional music.</p>



<p>In naming the piece after the Asturias region, Albéniz implies a musical portrait, conjuring a sense of Spanish regional identity and local color. The title prepares the listener to be transported to the province through sound.</p>

<p>I happened to catch this concert and decided to listen since it featured a Portuguese artist playing the Portuguese guitar, something you don&#8217;t often see on international channels.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t heard of Marta Pereira da Costa before, although I knew her name. She&#8217;s the world&#8217;s first and only professional female Portuguese guitar player in Fado music.</p>



<p>Right away the sound reminded me of Carlos Paredes, a legendary Portuguese guitarist, but with a fresher vibe, mainly from the percussion. Traditionally the Portuguese guitar is accompanied by two guitars, but here it&#8217;s one guitar plus percussion, bringing a modern twist which I enjoy.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m biased since I love the Portuguese guitar, but Marta&#8217;s playing conveys so much expression and goes beyond mellow tunes. Even faster, danceable songs have a singing, soaring quality from her guitar.</p>



<p>Another thing I enjoyed was how Marta lets the other instruments shine, especially in the last song. The interplay of bass and treble, each with its moment, creates a really beautiful, rich sound.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hector Berlioz&#8217;s Symphonie Fantastique, composed in 1830, perfectly reflects the obsessive mind of its composer, Berstein said in&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hector Berlioz&#8217;s Symphonie Fantastique, composed in 1830, perfectly reflects the obsessive mind of its composer, Berstein said in its Young People&#8217;s Concerts. But when I first listened to the symphony, I hadn&#8217;t watched Berstein&#8217;s video, so I expected something more contained and safe like other works from that period. But I soon realized why it&#8217;s called &#8220;Fantastique.&#8221; For me, the word &#8220;fantastique&#8221; evokes not grandness but a sense of surreal fantasy. In my interpretation, the symphony, rather than presenting a linear narrative, unfolds as flashes of disconnected dreams, each reflecting the protagonist&#8217;s shifting emotions and his fixation on an unattainable woman.</p>



<p>The first dream depicts meeting his beloved; the second involves a failed attempt to reach her at a ball; the third transports him to a tranquil rural setting, offering a brief respite from the turmoil; the fourth descends from a dream into a nightmarish execution; the final movement plunges him into a fantastical afterlife world. My feeling at the end is that maybe the woman of his dreams was only a woman in his dreams. </p>



<p>The reason I previously stated that I felt Fantastique was related to fantasy,  was due to the surreal and psychedelic nature of the music, which portrays the lovesick hallucinations and nightmares of the protagonist. Musically, Berlioz employed unexpected dynamic changes and unsettling orchestration, such as the use of real thunder in the storm scenes, taking a step further from Beethoven’s approach. He also innovatively used the main theme. This idée fixe is not merely a static melody; it undergoes a captivating transformation throughout the symphony, mirroring the protagonist’s evolving emotions and the unfolding narrative. As the symphony progresses, the idée fixe becomes increasingly distorted and anguished, reflecting the depths of the protagonist’s obsession and despair.</p>



<p>The first appearance of the idée fixe seems different from when a main theme is typically introduced, for example, in Beethoven&#8217;s Symphony No. 6. First, it doesn&#8217;t appear until around 5 minutes into the first movement, after an extended setup section &#8211; almost like an introduction leading us into the dream. When the idée fixe finally enters, it is in the form of a long, unaccompanied melody in the woodwinds, with bursts of energetic strings punctuating it. This unique presentation reminded me a bit of the surprising and unsettling rhythms in Stravinsky&#8217;s Rite of Spring. That unexpected rhythm must have been a shocking revelation for early 20th-century listeners.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="596" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-1024x596.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1823" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-1024x596.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-300x175.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-768x447.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-1536x893.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-2048x1191.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-640x372.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03-960x558.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-05-at-22.07.03.png 2816w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Although as I said before, the Idée fixe is transformed through the movements, its use in the fourth movement is extremely symbolic in its subtlety and, I must say, humour. This movement engages in the musical depiction of a march to execution. After the pastoral setting of the previous movement, the music abruptly shifts to the protagonist&#8217;s march to the scaffold, accompanied by a marching band. I was surprised because I expected a solemn setting, but instead it sounds almost celebratory, like a fanfare. The booming percussion and horns set a marching rhythm while the strangely cheerful melodies in the woodwinds and strings portray the crowd jeering the prisoner to his death. Just before the fatal blow, the idée fixe appears one last time on the clarinet, only to be suddenly, brutally cut off, symbolizing the severing of the head. The vivid musical imagery transported me right to the exact scene Berlioz intended to depict, which I found brilliant.</p>



<p>In the fourth movement, there are two main themes—a descending theme and a march theme—as well as a countermelody for the first theme. These all contribute to the overall feeling of the movement. The descending theme introduces a sense of despair, while the march theme brings the strangely cheerful contrast I mentioned earlier. One interesting thing is how the descending theme contrasts with the Idée Fixe melody—the Idée Fixe has a hopeful, ascending trajectory, whereas the descending theme embarks on a continuous, hopeless downward journey.</p>

<p>In the end, I must say that I adored this symphony. I feel that Berlioz brings a dramatic and theatrical sensibility to the symphonic writing, vividly portraying the emotional world of his desperate protagonist. So while fantastique may not be about grandness in the heroic sense, it represents a daring new musical language filled with psychedelic fantasy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Beethoven&#8217;s first piano sonata (No. 1 in F minor, Op 2) displays the hallmarks of the Classical style.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Beethoven&#8217;s first piano sonata (No. 1 in F minor, Op 2) displays the hallmarks of the Classical style. It contains a straightforward sonata form structure, opening with a lively first movement dotted with playful melodies. The middle movements provide contrast &#8211; a peaceful Adagio followed by a brisk dance-like section similar to a minuet. The finale introduces a vigorous theme. Throughout the piece, Beethoven focuses on balanced phrases and graceful melodies, supported by conventional harmony and rhythms &#8211; all trademarks of the Classical period.</p>



<p>In contrast, his final piano sonata (No. 32 in C minor, Op 111) exhibits innovations that push toward Romanticism. While still structured into movements, the form is more ecstatic, especially in the mystical opening movement. In this sonata, I hear many more chromatic harmonies and elastic rhythms and feel there&#8217;s an emotional range from brooding melancholy to joyful jubilation. The enriched harmonic palette and depth of expression represent the early Romantic style. </p>



<p>My research, in general, supports my feelings.</p>



<p>In the Opus 2 sonatas of his early period, Beethoven hews more closely to the balanced elegance of Mozart and Haydn. But flashes of his revolutionary voice emerge even then in the intense, turbulent passages. It contains a straightforward sonata form structure, opening with a lively first Molto Allegro movement characterized by accelerating small phrases leading to mini-climaxes, followed by pauses for theatrical effect. The middle Adagio movement offers the only overtly &#8216;pretty&#8217; music in the whole sonata &#8211; simple, serene melodies decorated with lavish ornamentation. The Allegretto finale features a slightly anxious minute tune pieced together from repeated fragments, counteracted by a smoother, more elegant major-mode Trio section.</p>



<p>The Op. 111 is regarded as one of Beethoven&#8217;s best piano compositions. It is a departure from previous sonatas, having only two movements, which led his publisher to question if it wasn&#8217;t a mistake. The sonata is described as powerful, passionate and inventive. For example, Beethoven transforms a simple and singable theme into five variations, ending in a serene and transcendent mood. Yet the animated fugue demonstrates Beethoven&#8217;s contrapuntal mastery cultivated in the Classical tradition. This piano sonata encapsulates Beethoven&#8217;s musical evolution from formal lucidity toward mystical, subjective soundscapes, prefiguring Romantic ideals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Antonio Vivaldi wrote three concertos for a small, high-pitched instrument called the &#8220;flautino&#8221;. The exact instrument Vivaldi intended is unknown, but scholars believe it was either the sopranino recorder or the flageolet. In the 18th century, the transverse flute replaced both the recorder and flageolet and a new edition of Vivaldi&#8217;s concerto was published for the piccolo, a member of the flute family. This is the version that is typically performed today and it was the one I listened to.</p>

<p>As soon as the orchestra begins the opening Allegro molto, the piccolo enters with a joyful, singing melody in the upper octave that immediately grabs my attention. The piccolo part requires technical agility as it features fast runs and trills, but the melodies flow so naturally that the difficulty is masked and it looks easy.</p>



<p>The calm and emotional middle Largo movement offers a lovely change from the faster outer movements. The piccolo carries a gorgeous, flowing melody above soft strings, reminiscent of a soulful operatic aria. It&#8217;s my favourite part—a moment where the piccolo&#8217;s expressiveness truly shines.</p>



<p>The concluding Allegro brings back the cheerful mood, with the piccolo presenting new melodic material over the orchestra&#8217;s constant, pulsing motion. The themes are fragmented with trills, creating a perpetually moving, spinning sensation. The cadenza features more rapid runs that showcase the soloist&#8217;s skill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Of course, I already knew the melody of the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, since it is one of the most used melodies in Christmas ads. But at this time I listened to it closely. In the beginning, I was immediately struck by the beauty of the music. The melody is light and airy and has a childish magical quality that transports you to another world. The use of the celesta gives the music a unique, ethereal and enchanting sound.</p>



<p>The presence of the bass clarinet is brief but it is truly remarkable. It brings a new tone and colour that adds depth to the beginning of the piece. The choice of the bass clarinet seems to bring a warm, mellow and rounded sound in contrast to the brighter, crystalline tones of the celesta. This elevates the overall feeling of the fantastical and mysterious setting.</p>



<p>Overall, it evokes a profound sense of innocent joy and wonder for me. The music exudes a youthful spirit of fantasy and imagination. It&#8217;s a timeless piece that brings out the inner child in me. Every listen renews feelings of wide-eyed enchantment and marvel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The bass clarinet is a woodwind instrument with a deep, rich tone, it provides a foundation for the woodwind section and entire ensemble. Though the bass clarinet has a relatively short history compared to other orchestral instruments, it has evolved into an expressive voice capable of solo works as well as supporting roles.</p>



<p>The earliest predecessor of the bass clarinet was the basset horn, developed in the 1770s. This instrument paved the way for lower-pitched clarinets. The first true bass clarinets emerged in the late 18th century. Heinrich Grenser is credited with creating one of the earliest examples in 1793. However, it was the pioneering instrument maker Adolphe Sax who developed the first fully satisfactory bass clarinet in 1838. Sax gave the instrument a wider bore and re-designed the key work to improve intonation across all registers. His innovations established the bass clarinet design that is still used today.</p>



<p>While the bass clarinet was slow to be accepted into orchestras at first, composers soon began to appreciate its unique timbre. Meyerbeer featured the instrument prominently in his 1836 opera Les Huguenots, one of the earliest uses of the bass clarinet in the orchestra. By the late 19th century, the bass clarinet had become a permanent member of the orchestra&#8217;s woodwind section. Its mellow, velvety tone contrasted with the more piercing oboe and soprano clarinet timbres.</p>



<p>In the orchestra, the bass clarinet typically provides harmonic support in the tenor and bass range. It handles the lower woodwind parts while the bassoon takes higher tenor lines. The bass clarinet has a remarkable three-octave range, overlapping the bassoon at the bottom end and the soprano clarinet at the top. This allows composers flexibility in orchestration. The instrument&#8217;s dark, brooding resonance lends itself well to dramatic effects.</p>



<p>Many composers took advantage of the bass clarinet&#8217;s solo potential as well. In Mahler&#8217;s Symphony No. 6, the bass clarinet introduces a moving theme in the first movement. Tchaikovsky exploits the instrument&#8217;s deep sound in The&nbsp;Nutcracker&#8217;s Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. Stravinsky showcases the agility of the bass clarinet at the beginning of The Rite Of Spring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The history of the piccolo is closely tied to that of the flute. The first transverse flute was developed in the Middle Ages as an adaptation of the recorder. As military bands adopted the flute, a smaller version was created to make the flute parts more prominent. This petite flute was initially keyed like a recorder with six finger holes and was used to play melodies an octave above the flute.</p>



<p>In the early 18th century, the first piccolos appeared in orchestral scores, including works by Jean-Philippe Rameau. However, it was initially referred to by names like &#8220;flautino&#8221; or &#8220;petite flute&#8221; rather than piccolo. The instrument continued to develop alongside the flute, especially after Theobald Böehm invented the modern flute fingering system in 1832. Böehm&#8217;s revolutionary key mechanism was soon adapted for the piccolo as well.</p>



<p>One of the earliest major works to feature the piccolo was Handel&#8217;s opera Rinaldo in 1711. Composers began to utilize its unique shrill timbre to provide colour and brilliance. For example, Beethoven used the piccolo in his 6th Symphony to imitate the sound of whistling birds. Its high register allows it to be heard over the entire orchestra, making it an excellent accent instrument.</p>



<p>Today, the piccolo is a standard member of the orchestra and band. Its most common variant is pitched an octave above the concert flute, although piccolos pitched a major third above the flute are also used. Its highest notes can reach up to C7, above the treble clef staff.</p>



<p>The piccolo&#8217;s bright sound serves to bring out melodic lines and add sparkle to orchestral textures. As one of the highest instruments in the orchestra, the piccolo&#8217;s clear notes cut through dense arrangements. Composers often utilize the piccolo to introduce themes or complement the woodwinds. </p>



<p>While associated with the flute section, the piccolo player may switch between the regular flute and piccolo multiple times in a single piece. Due to its penetrating timbre, the piccolo is used with good judgment to avoid overpowering the ensemble. However, short piccolo solos and highlights prevent listener fatigue.</p>



<p>Piccolo parts require advanced techniques to handle the altissimo register and quick figurations composers write. Rapid passages showcase the piccolo&#8217;s agile nature. Trills, runs, and arpeggios demand precise finger dexterity. The small size necessitates strict embouchure control. Intonation can also prove tricky with so few open finger holes to adjust the pitch.</p>



<p>While the piccolo often plays an accompaniment role, there are also many famous solos and melodies written for it. For example, the piccolo solo in the first movement of Shostakovich&#8217;s 6th Symphony. The soloist plays with delicate restraint, creating a thoughtful and powerful moment. Other works that highlight the piccolo include Tchaikovsky&#8217;s The Nutcracker, which features the piccolo along with the flute flute engaging in a lively duet, in the Chinese Dance. and John Philip Sousa&#8217;s &#8220;The Stars and Stripes Forever,&#8221; which features a famous piccolo countermelody above the marching band.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>John Coltrane&#8217;s composition &#8220;Naima&#8221; is a lush, emotional ballad that showcases his virtuosic command of the tenor saxophone. The song is a tribute to Coltrane’s wife, Juanita Naima Grubbs, and is one beautiful ballads. The saxophone is the centerpiece of the song, accompained by the piano, the bass and the drums.</p>



<p>As soon as the saxophone enters, I am enveloped in the bittersweet melancholy of the piece. The tone is robust yet smooth, almost vocal-like in the way he caresses each note with vibratos and slight inflections that hint at a longing.</p>



<p>The flexibility and range of the saxophone allows Coltrane to truly sing through his instrument, conveying a depth of feeling that spans smooth joy to deep sorrow. I find his playing meditative and prayerful.</p>



<p>One of the things that makes Coltrane’s saxophone so expressive is his use of dynamics. He’s able to play softly and delicately one moment and then switch to a more forceful and aggressive style the next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last night I had the pleasure of attending a live performance of Mozart&#8217;s Requiem. When the conductor stepped up, he surprised us all by announcing they would open with Samuel Barber&#8217;s Adagio for Strings before moving into the Requiem. Though I knew the piece from movies and commercials, I had never truly listened closely before. I found it profoundly moving.</p>



<p>The opening immediately establishes a heavy, mournful mood brimming with emotional weight. It&#8217;s easy to understand why this piece is often played at funerals, including Einstein&#8217;s.</p>



<p>The main theme is deceptively simple &#8211; just three notes ascending. Yet the aching slowness, the dragging tempo, creates the sense of struggling to lift upwards only to fall back down. I loved how the stately, elongated melody passes from the violins to the violas and finally, the cellos, maintaining its emotional power throughout.</p>



<p>To me, it sounded extremely beautiful, but the melody alone doesn&#8217;t convey the full emotional impact. That comes from the harmony of the other strings, which inspire the melody with all its feelings. The rich harmonies and colours of the string orchestra add emotive depth. </p>



<p>This piece perfectly captures the universality of grief, transcending time and place. Though it was composed in 1936, it speaks profoundly to the shared human experience across cultures and generations. Little did Barber know what the world was about to witness and how this song would be embraced as an expression of mourning, remembrance, and hope.</p>



<p>In the end, it proved the perfect prelude to Mozart&#8217;s Requiem. Well-chosen, maestro.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This part of the course was challenging, but the end result made it all worth it. I never expected to spend so much time on it, especially since I have a full-time job and two young children. However, I can’t say that I regret the time spent because it was well worth it.</p>



<p>One of the most interesting aspects of this part was studying how composers in the 20th century started breaking the established conventions of tonality and harmony. It’s also interesting to see how this connects to major events like the World Wars.</p>



<p>Most of my time was spent diving deep into research for this assignment. I followed the advice of choosing a style that I was not familiar with, so I decided to focus on microtonal music. Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed learning about this style even though it challenged every notion and expectation that I had about its music.</p>



<p>For my research, I had one big question in mind for this assignment. How does microtonality improve the expressiveness of music? And the answer is clear: microtonality gives composers a wider range of pitches and harmonies to use. The effect is a more nuanced feel that’ll create diverse musical effects. It’s almost as if you gave a painter an even bigger palette of colours. Essentially, it allows music to have stronger emotions and meanings.</p>



<p>In my assignment, I think I was able to present my findings in an easy way to understand. However, I think there’s definitely still more to learn about this topic that wasn’t covered here. One thing is for sure, microtonalist composers liked to use this as a way to explore new ways of expression. And we can definitely see that in their work ranging from Carrillo to Collier.</p>



<p>For me, the biggest discovery was the connection between microtonality and the human voice. As Partch demonstrated in his opera King Oedipus, microtonality can capture the natural inflexions and variations of the voice that aren&#8217;t limited to 12 tones. This makes it a powerful tool for expressing human emotion and experience.</p>



<p>One question that still lingers in my mind is: is microtonal music a style or technique? On one hand, there are complete musical pieces composed entirely with microtonal intervals which suggests that microtonality is a distinctive style. Then, on the other hand, I learned that it can be used in any genre or style as an expressive tool. Maybe it’s both depending on how it’s applied and perceived.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I think this research was valuable because I was able to appreciate and understand microtonal music better. Plus, it inspired me to try composing my own music using microtonal intervals. Which should be easier with today&#8217;s technology.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Microtonal music doesn&#8217;t have a universally accepted definition. For example, The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Microtonal music doesn&#8217;t have a universally accepted definition. For example, The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians discusses microtones but not microtonal music (Ader, 2020). But it generally refers to using musical notes between the standard intervals.</p>



<p>The lack of consensus may be because microtonality has wide applications &#8211; from subtle timbre changes to entirely new sounds challenging traditional concepts of harmony and melody. But what is true about it is that microtonal music has the potential to broaden music&#8217;s expressive range. Dividing tones into fractions under a semitone allows composers to create new harmonies, melodies, and textures, evoking more emotions and ideas, and accurately simulating non-Western music.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that discussing microtonal music risks being too Western-centric. Equal temperament is the main tuning in Western popular music (Carlos, 1987). However, most world music, past and present, uses larger or smaller intervals than a semitone. Microtonality is integral to music cultures like Arab maqamat, African traditional, Indian classical shruti, Indonesian gamelan, Chinese, and more &#8211; each with unique tuning systems (Geer, 2014).</p>



<p>The microtonality found in many traditional musical traditions is often intuitive, based on the natural harmonics of instruments and the human voice. In contrast, the development of microtonality in Western music in the early twentieth century was more theoretical and experimental.</p>



<p>Ader defends that the fragmentation that occurred in the world of art during the early twentieth century was a major catalyst for the development of microtonality in music (2020). This was due to the breaking down of traditional forms in poetry and visual arts, which drove artists to explore the essence of their art forms, challenge conventions, and find new modes of expression. Poets began to focus on phonemes and sound, while visual artists dismantled traditional structures. This spirit of experimentation and focus on the most elemental components of an art form also inspired composers to explore microtonality.</p>



<p>Several composers explored microtonality, including Ivan Wyschnegradsky, Ferruccio Busoni, Charles Ives, and Ben Johnston. Alois Hába, Harry Partch, and Julián Carrillo represent slightly different perspectives and are worth discussing further.</p>



<p>Alois Hába (1893-1973), a Czech composer, teacher, and theorist, was a microtonal music pioneer. He grew up in Moravia, where he was influenced by local folk music and subsequently developed an interest in microtones (Forkert, 2020:79). Further encouraged by composers like Ferruccio Busoni and Hermann Scherchen, Hába created his own quarter-tone system, aiming to enhance tonality rather than replace it. As a teacher and theorist at the Prague Conservatoire, he educated many in microtonal composition and advocated for tonality preservation while using microtones. His compositions, including quartets, operas, and chamber music, blended tonal and microtonal elements in a distinct sound. His immense contribution to microtonal music influenced many composers, marking important milestones in 20th-century music.</p>



<p>Harry Partch (1901-1974) was an American just intonation pioneer. He was inspired by a German physicist’s book, leading him to create over 30 custom instruments for a 43-note octave scale, compared to the conventional 12-note. His pursuit led him to create over 30 custom musical instruments capable of producing a scale with an impressive 43 notes per octave, a significant departure from the conventional 12-note octave found on the piano. He invented his own notation system to represent the microtones in his music (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, no date). Partch’s motivation was to emulate the fluidity and expressive range of the human voice, which he believed was inadequately represented by traditional scales. Throughout his life, Partch remained dedicated to pushing the boundaries of music, challenging established norms, and exploring the untapped potential of sound. His enduring legacy is preserved at institutions like the Harry Partch Institute at the University of Washington, where musicians and enthusiasts continue to study, perform, and even recreate his innovative instruments.</p>



<p>The Mexican composer Julián Carrillo (1875-1965) claimed to have discovered microtones in 1895 by dividing violin strings into sixteenths. However, he did not compose microtonal music until 1922 when he became aware of the European microtone scene. Carrillo then developed an elaborate microtonal system called Sonido 13 that divided the octave into quarter tones and smaller intervals. He promoted Sonido 13 as a revolutionary break from the 12-tone octave that would destroy existing music, in contrast to European composers who saw microtones as an extension of tradition. Carrillo also theorized his system extensively in books and articles, conducting tuning experiments on harps and making conclusions about harmonics and acoustics. Though often aggressive in tone, Carrillo&#8217;s writings laid out a systematic microtonal theory unmatched by his European contemporaries. With Sonido 13, Carrillo sought to assert Mexico&#8217;s claim over microtones against European musical dominance.</p>



<p>The influence of pioneering composers in microtonality has resonated through the years. Contemporary composers, such as Horaţiu Rădulescu, Krzysztof Penderecki, and Ryo Noda, have contributed to notating microtonality into the contemporary musical canon.</p>



<p>Modern Western music has not forgotten microtonality, although it has long been used as an ornamental embellishment to add tension. The most familiar example is the bending of notes, where pitches often end up between the semitone intervals, creating microtones. A more recent example is Hans Zimmer&#8217;s use of microtonal string glissandos in the Joker&#8217;s theme for The Dark Knight soundtrack. The strings rise through several microtones between chromatic pitches, creating an extremely unsettling sound. A similar microtonal string effect occurs at the end of Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;How to Disappear Completely.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although temperament and expanded tunings were not historically adopted by pop and rock musicians, often avoiding them in favour of heavy pitch correction with auto-tune, there has been a recent surge in interest from modern artists. Dua Lipa, Sza, Jacob Collier, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, and They Might Be Giants have incorporated microtones into their music, pushing the boundaries of pop, rock, and electronica.</p>



<p>Technology has played a pivotal role in pushing microtonality into the forefront of music. Software like Ableton Live has made it easier to integrate microtonal tunings (Hart, 2016). This has led many microtonal EDM musicians to craft their own tunings, seeking new intervals and sonorities beyond conventional tuning systems.</p>



<p>Ultimately, microtonal music has the potential to enlarge the expressive potential of music by adding finer nuances and more complex language. By dividing the usual Western twelve-tone scale into smaller intervals it is possible to arrive at new harmonies and melodies unavailable within the common system. This creates more varied emotional expressions and new sound textures and colours. Comparable to how unquantized percussion revolutionised hip-hop in the 1990s, microtonality can contradict listeners&#8217; assumptions, creating tension and release different from what is possible within the established Western system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul></ul>



<p>I must admit, prior to this, I was unfamiliar with Partch so this is my initial experience listening to any of his compositions. Partch was indeed a uniquely creative artist, as he was known for not only inventing his own musical instruments but also scoring his compositions for a 43-tone scale unique to these instruments.</p>



<p>Despite being created over 70 years ago (1950), this piece remains surprisingly fresh and innovative. The composition is marked by its distinct sound, thanks to the use of Partch&#8217;s own instruments like the Bass Marimba and the Hypobass.</p>



<p>Although the microtonal melodies and harmonies of the piece often sounded to me as dissonant and jarring, it&#8217;s the unsettling sound contrasted with the comical visual of the instruments that makes it so unique. The sonata is a satirical work going into themes of madness, delusion, and paranoia.</p>



<p>This composition thoroughly blends humour and lightness with hints of darker territories. The lyrics of the piece might seem nonsensical on the surface, but they carry potential interpretations concerning the human condition.</p>



<p>Listening to &#8216;Sonata Dementia&#8217; is a challenging experience. The microtonality might initially seem daunting, but it may not be as intricate as expected. The initial dissonance from the 43-tone scale, which might seem hard to accept at first, gradually becomes more harmonic and natural as the pieces develop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently listened to some parts of King Oedipus, an opera composed by Harry Partch. I was drawn to listen to it because of the information about how Partch started to dive into microtonality, as it more closely resembles the natural human voice. This actually makes total sense for opera. People don&#8217;t speak in 12 semitones, but actually in hundreds of microtones and opera relies heavily on the expression of the voice. As I listened to King Oedipus, I noticed how the voices sounded more like speech than singing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partch&#8217;s music for King Oedipus is a unique blend of microtonality, percussion, and spoken word. The voices sound more natural, not sung, but spoken. The instruments follow the vocals and strangely don&#8217;t sound as strange as they do in other microtonal pieces by Partch. The microtonality allows the voices to more closely match natural speech patterns, rather than conforming to the 12 notes of standard Western music. I enjoyed listening to King Oedipus, even though I did not hear the whole opera. It was a refreshing and stimulating experience that opened my ears to new possibilities of musical expression.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Julian Carrillo&#8217;s Seis casi-sonatas en cuartos de tono para violoncello solo, performed by Gerardo Gimenez Cacho, offers a fascinating glimpse into the expressive potential of microtonal music. As someone accustomed to the familiar 12-tone equal temperament of Western classical music, I found these quarter-tone sonatas surprisingly easy to listen to and appreciate. The solo cello format helps make the microtones feel intimate rather than jarring.</p>



<p>With these sonatas, I could understand how dividing the octave into smaller intervals can open up new sonic palettes and colours. Microtonality provides the performer access to the &#8220;cracks between the keys&#8221; &#8211; those poignant notes that float between our conventional Western pitches. The cello seems to emote in ways that would be impossible with merely 12 notes.</p>



<p>I cannot imagine how difficult these pieces must be to perform well, given the challenge of precisely nailing pitches outside of the equal temperament celloists spend years mastering. The skill demonstrated in this recording is hugely impressive.</p>



<p>Occasionally the quarter tones sound somewhat unsettling, but more often I found they enhanced the cello&#8217;s innate expressiveness. For example, the aching melody in the third movement of Sonata No. 4 attains an extra sadness from its microtonal sounds. The result is something simultaneously familiar and novel.</p>



<p>The quarter tones may initially sound like &#8220;out of tune&#8221; notes, but one&#8217;s ear quickly adjusts, and their emotional resonance becomes apparent. Julian Carrillo has created a compelling showcase for the cello as an instrument of uncommon subtlety. Even for listeners new to microtonality, these Casi-sonatas offer an accessible and rewarding introduction.</p>

<p>Listening to Jacob Collier&#8217;s &#8220;In The Bleak Midwinter&#8221; was an enlightening experience for me as I researched microtonality in modern music. As one of the most talented young musicians today, Collier&#8217;s ingenious use of microtones immediately drew me in. The track begins deceivingly simple but slowly builds in complexity. At one point, Collier modulates to what sounds like a G#. However, with microtonal inflexions, he has actually modulated to the key of G half-sharp major &#8211; something I did not detect on the first listen! The modulation is brilliantly executed, such that the music flows seamlessly.  I had to understand how he modulated and David Bruce helped me on that.</p>

<p>As I re-listened and focused on the microtonal shift, I better appreciated Collier&#8217;s technical mastery and innovative musicality. &#8220;In The Bleak Midwinter&#8221; proves he is not just one of the best musicians of our time, but one boldly expanding the boundaries of Western music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Radiohead is not a band that I particularly enjoy listening to, but I decided to listen to How to Disappear Completely to hear its use of microtonality. </p>



<p>The song starts off with a simple guitar and Thom Yorke&#8217;s falsetto vocals, nothing too unusual for a Radiohead track. The lyrics are vague and ambiguous, but they convey a sense of detachment and dissociation from reality. The song gradually builds up with layers of orchestral strings, guitar effects, and electronic sounds, creating a rich and complex sonic landscape. About two-thirds of the way through, the strings come in playing microtonal intervals that clash with the conventional instrumentation. These non-standard pitches on the strings create an unsettling, tense atmosphere contrasting with the dreamy opening section. The microtonal strings sound almost like they&#8217;re playing a separate song altogether, weaving an anxious counter-melody against the main chords. </p>



<p>This incoherent effect highlights Yorke&#8217;s lyrics about feeling disconnected from reality. While Radiohead isn&#8217;t my go-to band, I found &#8220;How to Disappear Completely&#8221; an interesting song with the use of microtonality to convey emotional dissociation in music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I enjoyed Ives&#8217; Three Quarter Tone Pieces for Two Pianos more than Hába&#8217;s quarter-tone sonata. The interplay between the two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart, creates an intriguing sense of conversation. One piano is tuned to standard western 12-tone equal temperament, while the other uses quarter tones. At first, they both sound out of tune, which has a quirky, childlike quality. But at moments they harmonize in an unconventional way that sounds oddly &#8220;in tune.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I kept listening, I began to familiarize myself with the microtonal language. The quarter tones initially sound discordantly unfamiliar, but gradually become interesting as my ears adapt. Although the microtonal effect hasn&#8217;t become conventionally pleasing to my ears accustomed to the 12-note scale, I can recognize the inventive nature and derive pleasure from the music on its own merits.</p>



<p>Overall, the quarter-tone pieces demonstrate that microtonality is an acquired taste that requires time to appreciate. The outcome is a captivating sound that I can find enjoyable, even though it hasn&#8217;t fully convinced me.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Strange is the first word that comes to my mind when listening to Hába&#8217;s Sonata for Quarter-Tone Piano,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Strange is the first word that comes to my mind when listening to Hába&#8217;s Sonata for Quarter-Tone Piano, Op. 62. After researching microtonality, I&#8217;ve come to enjoy the concept and composers&#8217; reasons for exploring it. But the truth is my ears are so accustomed to the 12-semitone scale that I initially find microtonal music weird. Recent examples in rock and jazz, like King Gizzard and Jacob Collier, are growing on me. Yet even in the slower, more lyrical second movement of Hába&#8217;s sonata, I struggle to fully appreciate the quarter tones. </p>



<p>Making an effort to keep an open mind, I can sense the pioneering spirit of discovery in Hába’s quarter-tone innovations. They impart an otherworldly, dreamlike quality as my ear gradually adjusts. But my long familiarity with 12-tone equal temperament means microtones continue to sound strange at first, even as I recognize their creative possibilities. However, after listening to it more carefully, I started to notice there&#8217;s some beauty and subtlety of the quarter tones. The sonata has a lot of variation and contrast that I can see me appreciating it the more I listen to it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While graphic scores may seem like an unfamiliar concept to many, they hold profound importance in the world of music composition. Rather than using traditional musical notation, graphic scores convey musical instructions through abstract symbols, shapes and colours &#8211; offering more openness to interpretation between composer and performer. </p>



<p>One of the earliest known uses of graphic notation can be seen in the 15th-century score &#8220;Belle, Bonne, Sage&#8221; by Baude Cordier. Crafted in the shape of a heart, it was a pioneering example of &#8220;eye music&#8221; &#8211; utilizing the visual design of the score as part of the composition. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-795x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1707" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-795x1024.png 795w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-233x300.png 233w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-768x990.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-300x387.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1-640x825.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-1.png 838w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></figure>



<p>Modern graphic notation truly emerged in the 20th century. Morton Feldman&#8217;s 1950 work &#8220;Projection 1&#8221; for solo cello featured scores that resembled abstract art or circuit diagrams more than standard sheet music. It showcased a trully visual innovation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="850" height="253" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1709" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2.png 850w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2-300x89.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2-768x229.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2-640x190.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></figure>



<p>What fascinates me most about graphic scores is their versatility. Some composers provide detailed guidelines to steer performers towards a specific vision, like George Crumb&#8217;s illuminating score for &#8220;Agnus Dei [SYMBOL]&#8221;, which is less abstract and relies on traditional notation symbols.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="639" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-1024x639.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1711" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-1024x639.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-300x187.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-768x479.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-1536x958.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-2048x1278.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-640x399.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4-960x599.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-4.png 2436w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>However, others opt to leave symbols purposefully vague, inviting creative dialogue between visual structure and a performer&#8217;s artistic sensibilities. Cornelius Cardew&#8217;s massive &#8220;Treatise&#8221; is a stunning example, offering no instructions on interpretation or instrumentation across its 193 pages.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="638" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1024x638.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1710" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1024x638.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-300x187.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-768x479.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1536x957.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-640x399.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-960x598.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>More than just an alternative form of notation, graphic scores blur the lines of distinction between visual art and music composition. The visual design becomes an integral part of conveying musical ideas, shedding light on how we perceive and synthesize different modes of art. Some graphic scores can even represent or visualize an existing piece of music, creating a physical manifestation for an otherwise abstract, intangible sound landscape, like for example the work of Nicholas Rougeux.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="966" height="1449" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1712" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited.png 966w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-200x300.png 200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-683x1024.png 683w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-768x1152.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-300x450.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-640x960.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-edited-960x1440.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As a Led Zeppelin fan, I was eager to check out the band Greta Van Fleet after a friend&#8217;s recommendation. While I enjoyed several of their retro-rock tracks that pay homage to Zeppelin&#8217;s classic sound, the song &#8220;Light My Love&#8221; stood out as my favourite.</p>



<p>The piano melody at the start sets up an interesting intro, but after a few bars, the song explodes into a full-on rock explosion. The lead singer, Josh Kiszka, has a voice that sounds remarkably similar to the legendary Robert Plant &#8211; soaring and crystalline one moment, then shifting into joyful wails that drive the energy ever higher.</p>



<p>Though the chorus repeats in typical pop fashion, the anthemic sound of guitars and drums keeps it from being repetitive. Kiszka unleashes some spectacular high screams that electrify the lyrics. Overall, while Greta Van Fleet wears their influences proudly, &#8220;Light My Love&#8221; shows they can also craft an exhilarating retro-rock song that stands on its own. For a Led Zeppelin fan like me, it left me eager to hear more from this talented young band.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I really enjoy Steve Reich&#8217;s Clapping Music. It&#8217;s a creative and fascinating piece that uses only clapping to build intricate rhythms. There are no harmonies or melodies—just two performers clapping.</p>



<p>The background of this composition is also interesting. In 1972, Reich was inspired by a flamenco duo&#8217;s clapping patterns in Brussels and decided to apply his compositional technique called phasing to clapping. This resulted in a piece that became a major milestone in Reich&#8217;s career and helped reinforce Minimalism as a fresh perspective after the complexity of atonality.</p>



<p>The piece has clear instructions for the performers. The two performers begin clapping their assigned patterns in unison. One performer maintains their pattern unchanged, while the other performer gradually shifts their pattern ahead by one eighth-note at a time. This process of phase shifting creates a polyrhythmic texture as the parts drift apart. It&#8217;s hypnotic to hear the simple claps interweave. As the patterns phase apart, the texture grows denser and more energetic. When they realign, it&#8217;s satisfyingly resolved.</p>



<p>I admire how Reich does so much with something so basic. The phasing technique adds great depth to something so simple. The repeating patterns make me feel meditative and mindful. It&#8217;s always surprising to hear the different rhythms emerge. The subtle changes keep me engaged throughout the almost 5 minutes . This music shows Reich&#8217;s skill with rhythm and repetition: using just claps, he creates music that is complex and trance-like. Ultimately, I believe the piece serves as a creative study of musical texture and rhythm using only the fundamental human instrument: the clap.</p>



<p>One final small detail: At the end of a live performance, the audience uses the same instrument as the performers. I believe it&#8217;s the only piece of music where this happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Shostakovich faced inte­nse criticism and potential perse­cution from Soviet authorities for his controversial ope­ra, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. In response­ to Stalin&#8217;s anger at a performance of the opera, Shostakovich withdrew his Fourth Symphony. According to several publications, Shostakovich composed the Fifth Symphony in 1937 to rede­em himself and align with Soviet ide­als. This symphony served as an opportunity for him to showcase his talent while moving away from the avant-garde nature of his music that had previously been denounced.</p>



<p>The final movement&#8217;s different interpre­tations, influenced by the different interpretations of the tempo, have sparked extensive debates. Some conductors prefer to play it faster than others.</p>



<p>Listening to various recordings, a faster tempo such as the recording of Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic tends to convey a sense of forward momentum, a relentless push towards what could be perceived as a triumph. On the other hand, slower performances, like the one conducted by Yevgeny Mravinsky and performed by the Leningrad Philharmonic, allow for the finer details of the piece to sink in. They offer the listener more time to breathe in the music and as a result, the piece sounds more laboured, possibly invoking darker, ominous undertones.</p>



<p>When taking a closer listening, one can understand that, beyond tempo, phrasing and dynamics also shape interpretations about this final movement. I personally like it best when it&#8217;s played at a moderate speed. This lets the music move forward while giving space for the small details. It finds a good balance.</p>



<p>After my research and several listenings, I found that the faster tempo seems to dismiss the turmoil and complexities underpinning this symphony&#8217;s creation. A slower tempo, while adding additional detail and space for interpretation, can add an overemphasized drama.</p>



<p>Given the circumstances under which Shostakovich composed this symphony, it seems more correct to interpret the finale as not a full triumph nor complete despair, but rather an ambiguous commentary reflecting Shostakovich&#8217;s precarious position.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Benjamin Britten&#8217;s opera Peter Grimes premiered at Sadler&#8217;s Wells Theatre in London on June 7, 1945. Britten had begun sketching the work in 1941 while living in America with his partner Peter Pears during WWII. After reading George Crabbe&#8217;s poem &#8216;The Borough,&#8217; Britten felt a surge of inspiration to write an opera set in the Suffolk fishing village of his youth. Though he used Crabbe&#8217;s character Peter Grimes as his protagonist, Britten departed from the poem&#8217;s storyline to craft an original libretto with Montagu Slater. The libretto humanizes Grimes while retaining his inherent violence and ambiguity.</p>



<p>Peter Grimes follows the story of a fisherman named Peter Grimes who is accused of murdering his apprentice boys. The opera explores themes of mob mentality and persecution of outsiders. The use of tonality in &#8216;Peter Grimes&#8217; is characterized by tritone relationships. The opera&#8217;s dramatic movement is generated by tonal progressions between the keys of A and E flat, symbolizing the impossibility of coexistence for Grimes and the Borough. It is this eerie score depicting the inner turmoil of the protagonist Peter Grimes, that lends the emotional power to the opera.</p>



<p>Peter Grimes was hailed as a landmark in British opera when it premiered. The conductor was Reginald Goodall and Peter Pears performed the role of Grimes. It was the first of Britten&#8217;s operas to gain international acclaim and launched his career as one of the leading opera composers of the 20th century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sonatas and interludes for Prepared Piano &#8211; This piece has a strong focus on rhythm. The prepared piano, with objects placed on and between strings, creates an unconventional timbre. Yet within this unique soundworld, Cage constructs an organized and cohesive musical work. I heard some resemblance to Javanese Gamelan music and some parts reminded me of the Rite of Spring.</p>



<p>Imaginary Landscape No. 4 &#8211; Cage&#8217;s first piece of chance music. By tuning radios to different frequencies, chance collages of sounds, speech and music emerge. The juxtaposition of these fragments is unpredictable but often intriguing. It&#8217;s music created by randomness rather than conscious design. Though it abandons traditional musical elements, it has a sense of playfulness and spontaneity that I find amusing.</p>



<p>Roaratorio, an Irish circus on Finnegans Wake &#8211; I found it really hard to enjoy this long composition. Combines field recordings, spoken word, and segments of Irish traditional music into a sound collage. The complex overlays create textures and rhythms. </p>



<p>Regarding serial and chance music, both approaches challenge conventional tonality and require an open mind from the listener. Cage demonstrates that music can emerge from unconventional sound sources, chance procedures and found objects. He accomplished to expand the conceptions of music, art and listening.</p>



<p>The serialist pieces have a very ordered, logical structure that comes through clearly in the listening. The rigid rules of serialism &#8211; avoiding repetition, and ordered rotations through the 12 tones &#8211; result in cerebral, mathematical music.</p>



<p>In contrast, Cage&#8217;s chance music lacks that calculated complexity. The randomness and unpredictability create a more chaotic, spontaneous feel. While the serialist process is evident to the listener, Cage&#8217;s process is opaque. We cannot directly hear compositional systems, but I find this obscure and surprising thought interesting.</p>



<p>I  still believe that my definition of music is still valid in this discussion. While the composer organizes sounds and applies musical techniques, the real art happens in the listener&#8217;s mind. As Cage showed, music can emerge from non-traditional sounds when the listener lends them meaning. My definition recognizes how the listener&#8217;s role gives life and validity to music. Without the listener&#8217;s act of listening, there is no music.</p>



<p>Cage&#8217;s chance pieces may not convey traditional emotional arcs, but they can evoke moods like dissatisfaction, serendipity, and even humour. Serialist works induce intellectual stimulation more than direct emotion. But even in this case, a listener need not comprehend the serial process to be affected by the music&#8217;s dramatic quality.</p>



<p>So while the compositional approach shapes aesthetic effect, I believe music can deliver emotional impact being it systematically composed or leaving it to chance. The listener&#8217;s subjective experience remains central to lending music it meaning.</p>



<p>While the compositional approach undoubtedly shapes the aesthetic effect, I believe music retains the power to deliver emotional impact whether coming from a serialist complexity or Cage&#8217;s randomness. Ultimately, the listener&#8217;s subjective experience remains central to lending music its meaning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I decided to perform John Cage&#8217;s 4&#8217;33&#8221; alone in my living room. I set a timer to keep up track of the time. At first, there was complete silence as I sat motionless on a chair. After about a minute, I started to hear subtle sounds &#8211; the gentle creaking of the wooden floor, distant traffic noises outside, and the occasional sound of myself shifting in their chair. These ambient sounds almost took on a musical quality as I focused intently on listening.</p>



<p>The effect was surprisingly mesmerizing. In the absence of deliberate music, the mundane sounds, often unnoticed, took centre stage, and I immediately understood what Cage intended with this piece.</p>



<p>Around the two-minute mark, the silence was broken by my stomach rumbling loudly. I had to stifle a laugh at this unexpected bodily interjection. A few moments later, a siren wailed in the distance. The juxtaposition of these random noises with the intended silence of the piece was amusing to me.</p>



<p>When the 4 minutes and 33 seconds were up, I felt a sense of accomplishment. Although an audience may have enhanced the experience, performing 4&#8217;33&#8221; alone made me appreciate the musical potential of everyday sounds. I found beauty in the silence between the noises. This piece definitely expanded my perspective on what can be considered music.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There were several composers I could choose from this period. Still, since I have an appreciation for merging&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There were several composers I could choose from this period. Still, since I have an appreciation for merging styles of music, and I always liked Rhapsody in Blue, I decided to investigate George Gershwin&#8217;s work.</p>



<p>George Gershwin (1898 &#8211; 1937), a son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, became inspired to pursue music at a young age. He began writing songs while working for a music publisher in Manhattan’s Tin Pan Alley, which led to his first major hit, “Swanee” in 1916. Gershwin collaboratively wrote some of the most popular songs of the interwar period with his brother Ira, a number of which have remained standards in jazz music such as Summertime, I Got Rhythm and They Can’t Take That Away From Me. Gershwin also composed several renowned classical pieces such as Rhapsody in Blue, and An American in Paris, as well as the opera Porgy and Bess.</p>



<p>To understand the impact of Gershwin&#8217;s work, it&#8217;s helpful to analyse the context of the interwar national identity crisis. After WWI, countries looked to culture to define their identities. However, in the US, this was different. The country had many cultural traditions due to immigration and migration, leading to new musical styles. In 1893, Dvořák thought Black music should be the basis for an American classical style. By the 1920s, African-American genres like ragtime, blues, and jazz were popular nationwide. Gershwin used jazz in Rhapsody in Blue to create a unique American classical piece, that blended European and African American sounds, fulfilling Dvořák&#8217;s idea that Black music could define an American style.  Rhapsody in Blue was commissioned by Paul Whiteman with the intent of “classicizing” jazz to increase its respectability among white audiences. It debuted with Gershwin himself as the piano soloist, with a jazz band and a string section for accompaniment.</p>



<p>Listening to Rhapsody in Blue with this context in mind I can get even more out of the piece. I always loved how it mixed different styles, but now I can see how it blends together European and African-American music in a very special way. I think the piano part really stands out in this, changing from arpeggios and flourishes from Classic European music to more jazzy and bluesy ones.</p>



<p>Another Gershwin song I liked listening to was &#8220;I Got Rhythm&#8221;, which was written by the Gershwin brothers for the Broadway musical &#8220;Girl Crazy&#8221;. During this period, Broadway musicals were an important way to showcase music and were based on European operettas and comic operas. However, they were different as they included spoken dialogue, making them more accessible to everyone.</p>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t listened to it before, and the first time I listened to it, it sounded familiar, as if I had heard it before. After several listenings, I realised it was the syncopation and the call-response so usual in jazz that made it sound familiar. Actually, the chord progression from I Got Rhythm is known as the &#8220;rhythm changes&#8221;, and it&#8217;s the foundation for many other popular jazz tunes. </p>



<p>After realising the impact of this song, I decided to listen to his symphonic work Variations on &#8220;I Got Rhythm&#8221; for Piano and Orchestra. It caught me by surprise. It isn&#8217;t a piece of catchy pop music but it is inventive and, experimental but at the same time there&#8217;s always the jazzy feeling. I felt this could be the base of the development of Raphosy in Blues.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs4vYVdof8bc85dyGfx6svA"></a></p>



<p>Gershwin had a big influence on American music, even though his career was short. His works blended classical, jazz, and popular music, firmly establishing him as a leading figure in American modernism. His Broadway musicals, defied the notion that serious music had to remain distinct from popular culture, proving that meaningful music music could also entertain and be popular. While some classical critics initially questioned his approach, audiences and musicians loved it. His unique approach broke down music style barriers and brought an entire country together since he and others helped create a new American sound.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Maurice Ravel&#8217;s &#8220;Bolero&#8221; is a very well-known piece and is a masterful illustration of both orchestration and gradual development. Repeated continually, its single melody and rhythm manage to avoid monotony. Instead, Ravel uses a diversity of tonal colours, orchestral variation and incremental crescendo.</p>



<p>While not directly related to the music itself, I found Ravel&#8217;s background interesting context. His father was an accomplished inventor who created new machines and early cars. I believe that this exposure to machinery and technology as a child likely influenced Ravel&#8217;s fascination with mechanical sounds and rhythms, as evidenced in Bolero&#8217;s persistent snare drum beat.</p>



<p>Another intriguing aspect is Ravel&#8217;s use of the saxophone, uncommon in orchestral works of the era but prevalent in jazz. After listening, I researched possible jazz influences on Ravel. Indeed, he enjoyed jazz artists like Duke Ellington during a 1928 North American tour. He admired the percussive double bass and brassy glissandi. This openness seemingly inspired his experimentation in Bolero.</p>



<p>I&nbsp;deeply admire Ravel’s orchestration in &#8216;Bolero&#8217;.&nbsp;He fully exploits each instrument&#8217;s unique characteristics. His strategy of introducing the melody using different instruments in succession creates a unique texture and colour for each iteration of the theme. It’s not about a simple increase in the volume that results in the crescendo, but a careful layering of instruments that creates an intensifying texture within the piece.</p>



<p>The brief departure from the tonic key in the final segment of the piece, an unexpected occurrence in a piece that otherwise sticks rigidly to a single key, adds a mesmerising final twist. All the while, the steady percussion and pizzicato strings act as a grounding force, adding even more depth to the enthralling climax.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Varèse&#8217;s &#8220;Amériques&#8221; leaves me with mixed feelings. On one hand, I can appreciate its groundbreaking nature. Composed shortly after he moved to the U.S., you can sense this longing and curiosity, like he&#8217;s exploring new worlds. It&#8217;s wild and dissonant, with these intricate mixtures of percussion and wind instruments.</p>



<p>After hearing it, my definition of what music is hasn&#8217;t changed. I don&#8217;t want to come off as boastful, but I&#8217;m still convinced that music is a blend of sounds designed by a composer,  executed by a performer, which holds emotional significance for a human listener. This composition confirms my belief. Whether this is music or not really depends on the listener&#8217;s interpretation. In my view, it certainly is, although I didn&#8217;t fully appreciate it.</p>



<p>I actually want to appreciate &#8220;Amériques&#8221; for showcasing Varèse&#8217;s innovative spirit. But its interruptive, ever-changing nature also distances me from fully connecting with the music on an emotional level. While groundbreaking for its time, parts of its execution undermine my ability to fully experience what Varèse set out to convey about his new home and surroundings. Overall, I admire what he achieved, but also find myself holding it at arm&#8217;s length musically on repeated listens.</p>

<p>&#8220;A remarkable step forward on the way towards the ideal of symphonic unity (…) With his fifth symphony Sibelius raises the genre of the symphony to an entirely new cyclic level.&#8221;</p>
<cite><em>Veijo Murtomäki, musicologist, 1990</em></cite></blockquote>

<p>If there were any doubts about Sibelius being a national treasure even in his lifetime, they were completely dispelled by his 5th Symphony. Commissioned by the Finnish government to celebrate Sibelius&#8217;s 50th birthday – a national holiday – the symphony was premiered on the 8th December 1915, with Sibelius conducting the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. While the premiere in 1915 garnered success, it didn&#8217;t meet Sibelius&#8217;s personal standards. The work was revised twice, in 1916 and 1919, until it got the version we can hear today.</p>



<p>The uniqueness of this symphony lies in its cyclic unity &#8211; perhaps inspired by the cyclic nature of Finnish Folk music &#8211; with motifs recurring and transforming throughout the entire work. Its melodies are influenced by the sparse folk tunes of remote northern regions. The primal cell, heard in the opening horn call, contains the genetic code for all the important themes that follow. Sibelius moulds these themes with tremendous skill, subtly transforming them in each movement yet always retaining their essence.</p>



<p>The emotional pinnacle of the symphony is reached in the finale. Inspired by the sight of sixteen swans in flight, the finale depicts their rustling wings with trembling strings beneath an expansive melody. A majestic &#8220;swan theme&#8221; is introduced by horns. As the work reaches its conclusion, this theme transforms into an exultant shout of triumph.</p>



<p>Today, Symphony No. 5 stands not just as a patriotic reminder of Finland&#8217;s nationalistic spirit, but also stands as one of his finest achievements, capturing both the raw beauty of the Finnish landscape and the meditative spirit it inspired in the composer through its now-legendary &#8220;Swan Hymn.&#8221; Its evocation of the majestic swans continues to move listeners decades after its composition.</p>



<p>Experience the unfolding narrative of this symphony as it tells a mosaic story of a composer, his homeland, and the uncontrollable forces of life itself. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Debussy – Jeux (1912) The ballet&#8217;s title tells the story of a boy and two girls searching for&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4 id="debussy-jeux-1912" class="wp-block-heading">Debussy – Jeux (1912)</h4>



<p>The ballet&#8217;s title tells the story of a boy and two girls searching for a tennis ball but ending up playing other games, some childlike and others romantic. It&#8217;s like a musical mystery, where things change and evolve. The main thing I get from this piece is its fleeting nature. Everything seems brief – short motifs, regular tempo changes, and a lack of stability. But somehow, it all feels connected. When listening, I felt that Debussy was trying to convey a sense of childishness – inconsequential, unfocused, and whimsical. But at the same time, it feels sweet, dreamy, and magical. Strangely for a Debussy piece, there&#8217;s not much dissonance.</p>



<h4 id="stravinsky-the-rite-of-spring-1913" class="wp-block-heading">Stravinsky – The Rite of Spring (1913)</h4>



<p>The Rite of Spring is one of my favourite music pieces. I love its intensity, rough rhythms, and surprises. It begins with a beautiful and iconic bassoon at a higher pitch, which clashes with expectations because one would anticipate an oboe or clarinet playing that folk melody. Throughout the piece, there are unexpected dynamics and rhythms, often relying on dissonance and interruptions. I believe Stravinsky intended to provoke and make the listener uncomfortable, evoking a sense of despair similar to a young girl being sacrificed by dancing herself to death. The use of percussion is crucial for the ballet&#8217;s dance aspect and to convey that feeling of unease.</p>



<p>Interestingly, whenever I hear this piece, it reminds me of metal music concerts, where chaos and loud noises reign. In both the Rite of Spring and metal concerts, the percussive element of the instruments is what moves and excites people. It&#8217;s remarkable how this aspect remains unchanged despite the 100-year difference.</p>



<h4 id="schoenberg-pierrot-lunaire-1913" class="wp-block-heading">Schoenberg – Pierrot Lunaire (1913)</h4>



<p>This was the hardest piece to listen to. The Sprechstimme technique goes against what I was expecting for the vocal melody. This creates a spooky and unsettling feeling that I reckon may go along with the story. The harmony in this music doesn&#8217;t follow the traditional rules and doesn&#8217;t have a clear melody or a familiar pattern. Overall, even though it might have been challenging for me to appreciate this unusual music, I believe it may reveal many interesting and thought-provoking structures that when explored more deeply may be surprisingly creative. At the same time, it&#8217;s really hard for me to understand what impact this piece had on the overall music.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Comparing the three, despite being written just one year apart, they are completely different styles. Looking at today&#8217;s music, I find it refreshing to see that there was a time when the best composers were exploring completely different styles. If I were to give these three pieces a personality, I would say that Debussy&#8217;s is more emotional and sensitive, while Stravinsky&#8217;s is more primal and brute. Schoenberg’s is somehow much less earthly, more imaginative, and surreal.</p>

<p>I recently discovered Public Service Broadcasting when I heard their music performed by the 88-piece BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Jules Buckley. I liked it from the start and have been listening to it repeatedly.</p>



<p>I enjoyed how the music remains mostly the same but gradually adds different instruments and textures in a big build-up. </p>



<p>The most surprising aspect for me was the blend of drums and orchestra. I think exploring drums in an orchestral context adds a modern rhythmic element. I also liked the mix of pre-recorded sounds, electronic, and acoustic instruments. They fit together seamlessly, making it hard to distinguish between them.</p>



<p>Overall, it&#8217;s a perfect fusion of pop and classical music, with experimental elements that I appreciate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This course unit was quite challenging, especially since I decided to take on a full-time job alongside my studies. Balancing a full-time job, being a parent, and studying part-time has been quite demanding. As a result, my reflection centres around my perception that I wasn&#8217;t able to go as deeply into the subjects as I would have liked.</p>



<p>I found the first two projects to be incredibly valuable. They kickstarted my reflection on various aspects of music, such as its nature, what constitutes good music, and the differences between popular and classical music. This led me to question many of my preconceived notions.</p>



<p>One thing that pleasantly surprised me in this unit was the diverse range of music I was exposed to. From movie soundtracks to Indian music and contemporary styles I hadn&#8217;t encountered before, it expanded my musical horizons. Since my musical background was one of my main challenges, this exposure was truly beneficial. In hindsight, I think it would have been great to take this course as my first.</p>



<p>But, looking back, I wish I had spent more time on each subject. For example, I had a strong affinity for holy minimalist composers, and I would have loved to explore them further. On the other hand, microtonality and spectralism were not as enjoyable for me. I believe that with more time and study, I might have come to understand and appreciate what these composers are trying to convey.</p>



<p>The projects that focused on the Batman soundtrack and researching Magnus Lindberg were the ones I dedicated the most time to. Perhaps that&#8217;s why I found them particularly rewarding. Both projects allowed me to exercise a skill I had developed in the Stylistic Techniques course: writing about music. In both cases, I aimed to bring my own perspective to the table, going beyond regurgitating information readily available online. I hope I succeeded in conveying my own viewpoint while grounding it in factual information.</p>



<p>When I consider the overall content of the unit, I realize that some projects, such as those on orchestral instruments and music notation, had already been covered in other courses. If this had been my first course, those projects would have been perfect. However, since I had already delved into those topics before, I chose to skip them and dedicate more time to other projects.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I see progression in my studies, particularly in the broadening of my &#8220;musical baggage&#8221;. As for my writing skills, I have discovered that I find reflective texts much easier to write than &#8220;listening&#8221; ones. The most important lesson I have learned thus far is the need to improve my listening skills. I want to write about my experiences with music in a way that is clear, accurate, and captures everything that makes the music special to me.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Religious composers (holy minimalism) John Tavener &#8211; The LambI liked this song. I didn&#8217;t know John Tavener until&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 id="religious-composers-holy-minimalism" class="wp-block-heading">Religious composers (holy minimalism)</h3>



<p><strong>John Tavener &#8211; The Lamb<br></strong>I liked this song. I didn&#8217;t know John Tavener until today, and I was very impressed by this choral piece. It was peaceful, calm, and it seemed to be written to enjoy the echo of a church. This means that I didn&#8217;t feel sudden changes in the voices. Instead, they seemed to float on their own and slowly fade out.</p>



<p><strong>Arvo Pärt &#8211; Spiegel im Spiegel<br></strong>Another piece that I enjoyed, and I didn&#8217;t know the composer. The piano is very simple, but I think its purpose is to allow the violin to express long sustained notes. I can imagine this being played at a church, and the sound echoing through the walls. I have the desire to understand how deeply rooted this song is in Estonian traditional music.</p>



<p><strong>Henryk Górecki &#8211; Symphony No 3<br></strong>The music seems very peaceful but mournful at the same time, especially in the middle of the first movement when the soprano starts singing. I liked that the first half of the first movement seems like it is building up for a big explosion, but it never arrives. Overall, I think this symphony could be a soundtrack for a movie or documentary. I believe Zimmer thought so too.</p>



<h3 id="minimalism" class="wp-block-heading">Minimalism</h3>



<p><strong>Steve Reich &#8211; Music for 18 Musicians<br></strong>I find this type of music harder to enjoy. The simple sound and repetitive nature with subtle changes are not my preference. I understand the exploration of sounds, similar to Ravel&#8217;s Bolero, and can appreciate it to some extent. However, the length of the repetition is too much for me. Listening to it as a whole might induce a trance-like feeling and it made me wonder if this kind of music could also be used for religious purposes.</p>



<p><strong>Terry Riley &#8211; In C<br></strong>I tried to listen attentively to the entire piece, but once again, aside from the interesting exercise, I don&#8217;t find this art form truly enjoyable. What stood out to me was how the introduction of new sounds and instruments took the music on different paths. This was more noticeable when I skipped ahead a few minutes from time to time. I understand that the composer probably didn&#8217;t intend his music to be listened to this way, but for me, it provided a more interesting experience.</p>



<p><strong>Philip Glass &#8211; Glassworks<br></strong>I found this album much easier to appreciate than the previous two. Although there is still repetition, there is a sense of progression. It feels like the music is going somewhere. Some moments reminded me of Radiohead, which added another layer of interest. Another notable aspect of Glass&#8217;s music is the varied tempo compared to the previous pieces, creating interesting contrasts between songs.</p>



<h3 id="new-complexity" class="wp-block-heading">New complexity</h3>



<p><strong>Brian Ferneyhough &#8211; Exordium<br></strong>It&#8217;s difficult for me to write about this piece. I felt uncomfortable at times and wasn&#8217;t sure if I liked it or not. It seemed highly complex and lacked direction after my initial hearing. It felt more like an exploration of sounds rather than a cohesive composition. While I acknowledge that there is certainly thought behind this piece, I couldn&#8217;t fully grasp it.</p>



<h3 id="choral-music-tonality" class="wp-block-heading">Choral music/tonality</h3>



<p><strong>John Rutter &#8211; Requiem<br></strong>All of Rutter&#8217;s Requiem felt accessible to me. Even though I wasn&#8217;t familiar with the artist, there was a sense of déjà vu while listening to the pieces. It reminded me of Górecki, and I could imagine it as a movie soundtrack. The harmonies are simple, and the instrumentation is understated. However, this simplicity doesn&#8217;t diminish the emotional impact. For example, Agnus Dei felt mysterious and sombre to me.</p>



<p><strong>Eric Whitacre &#8211; Cloudburst<br></strong>The introduction was surprising and bewildering, with the gradual rise of all the sounds. I couldn&#8217;t determine if it was purely vocal or if other instruments were involved. I enjoyed how the voices floated at times, each having its own line, but I was even more captivated when they harmonized and created a powerful sonority.</p>



<h3 id="microtonality-and-spectralism" class="wp-block-heading">Microtonality and spectralism</h3>



<p><strong>Tristan Murail &#8211; Allegories<br></strong>I have limited knowledge of microtonality and spectralism, so this is a new experience for me. This particular piece left me uncertain about my feelings by the end. I attempted to identify recurring elements, but I struggled to do so. Instead, I found myself focusing on the electronic sounds and trying to differentiate them from the acoustic sounds. It was challenging for me to discern between the two. I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if this blurring of sounds was intentional on the part of the composer.</p>



<p><strong>Gérard Grisey – Les Espaces Acoustiques<br></strong>The overall pace of the music is slow, but it has a captivating effect. The first piece starts with a beautiful melody played by the viola which I really enjoyed. It had a certain pattern that kept coming back, and I couldn&#8217;t help but focus on it. As the piece progressed, more instruments joined in, which I found less interesting than the solo instrument.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 id="classical-music" class="wp-block-heading">Classical Music</h3>



<p>I haven&#8217;t been into classical music before. As a child, I didn&#8217;t have many chances to experience it, and as I got older, I leaned towards other genres. But since I started this course, my understanding and, consequently, my love for classical music have grown.</p>



<h3 id="contemporary-music" class="wp-block-heading">Contemporary Music</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m not very familiar with this genre, especially contemporary classical music. Nowadays, I don&#8217;t pay as much attention to it as I do to more traditional classical music.</p>



<h3 id="country-music" class="wp-block-heading">Country Music</h3>



<p>As someone who didn&#8217;t grow up in North America, country music did not made part of my listening environment as a child. I&#8217;ve come across some interesting songs, but I haven&#8217;t paid much attention to it. Lately, I&#8217;ve been enjoying the music of Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton.</p>



<h3 id="dance-music" class="wp-block-heading">Dance Music</h3>



<p>I was exposed to this genre a lot while growing up, whether through my brother or from going to nightclubs. However, it never really captured my interest. For me, the intensive repetition of music, with endless loops, bores me. Nevertheless, I do enjoy listening to Prodigy and Fatboy Slim.</p>



<h3 id="early-music" class="wp-block-heading">Early Music</h3>



<p>I have to admit, I didn&#8217;t listen to this genre very often. My main exposure to it was during my studies, when I explored it for academic reasons.</p>



<h3 id="folk-music" class="wp-block-heading">Folk Music</h3>



<p>I enjoy listening to Portuguese Folk Music, but besides my own country&#8217;s folk heritage, I don&#8217;t know much about folk music from around the world. The folk music I am familiar with is mainly from classical compositions that incorporated elements of folk music.</p>



<h3 id="jazz-music" class="wp-block-heading">Jazz Music</h3>



<p>Jazz took some time to grow on me. Initially, I didn&#8217;t have much of an affinity for it. However, as I delved deeper into learning about instruments and music theory, my appreciation for jazz started to blossom. Nowadays, it&#8217;s one of the genres I listen to the most. Stan Getz and Billie Holiday played a significant role in cultivating my love for jazz.</p>



<h3 id="musical-theatre-music" class="wp-block-heading">Musical Theatre Music</h3>



<p>As a child, I didn&#8217;t understand why characters in musical movies suddenly burst into song during conversations. This made me dislike the genre as a whole, including Disney movies. Over time, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate the music itself, but I still don&#8217;t enjoy the theatrical and cinematic elements that accompany it.</p>



<h3 id="opera-music" class="wp-block-heading">Opera Music</h3>



<p>Opera music, like musical theater, presents a similar challenge due to its complexity and occasional intricate ornamentation.</p>



<h3 id="pop-music" class="wp-block-heading">Pop Music</h3>



<p>What&#8217;s not to like in Pop Music? It&#8217;s catchy, easy to listen to, and often uplifting. I like pop music in general, especially when it offers something unique. Current pop artists I admire are Dua Lipa, Lizzo and Mark Ronson.</p>



<h3 id="rnb-music" class="wp-block-heading">R’n’B Music</h3>



<p>I was more exposed to R&#8217;n&#8217;B in the 2000&#8217;s when artists like Alicia Keys and Beyoncé exploded. However, my recent interest has shifted towards 70s music, which features incredible R&#8217;n&#8217;B artists like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder.</p>



<h3 id="rap-music" class="wp-block-heading">Rap Music</h3>



<p>Rap music is a genre that I either really love or strongly dislike. I&#8217;ve listened to a lot of rap music, particularly in the 2000s, which helped me develop an appreciation for artists like Eminem and Outkast. Recently, I&#8217;ve been enjoying De La Soul and The Roots after discovering J Dilla&#8217;s songs.</p>



<h3 id="reggae-music" class="wp-block-heading">Reggae Music</h3>



<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t know much about Reggae beyond Bob Marley. It&#8217;s mostly unfamiliar territory to me.</p>



<h3 id="rock-music" class="wp-block-heading">Rock Music</h3>



<p>In general, my listening attention is divided between Rock and Funk, so it&#8217;s a genre I appreciate a lot. I love the combination of bass, guitar, and drums. It&#8217;s amazing how these instruments can create such great music. I also find it fascinating how Rock has evolved over the years.</p>



<h3 id="soul-music" class="wp-block-heading">Soul Music</h3>



<p>As I&#8217;m getting older, I&#8217;ve been enjoying Soul music more and more. I&#8217;m particularly drawn to Soul songs that feature a strong bass line and keyboard melodies. They grab my attention right away.</p>



<p></p>



<h1 id="exploring-new-music" class="wp-block-heading">Exploring new music</h1>



<h3 id="reggae" class="wp-block-heading">Reggae</h3>



<p><strong>Ini Kamoze &#8211; World A Music</strong></p>



<p>I like how the beats syncopate on the 2nd and 4th. The sound that catches my attention the most is the reverb—it&#8217;s a bit excessive, but it adds that characteristic Reggae touch. The bassline is wonderfully uncomplicated, yet it perfectly complements the overall mood of the song. The vocals have such a relaxed vibe, which again aligns beautifully with the song and the genre. Overall, I really enjoyed it, although I must admit that the repetitive nature can get a bit monotonous after a while.</p>



<p><strong>Freak Out &#8211; Jackie Mittoo</strong></p>



<p>I enjoyed listening to this song. Even though it maintains the characteristic repetitiveness of Reggae, I find that being an instrumental piece adds a refreshing touch. What&#8217;s more, it strikes a perfect balance with the reverb—it&#8217;s not overpowering, and I genuinely appreciate that.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 id="opera" class="wp-block-heading">Opera</h3>



<p><strong>Mark-Anthony Turnage – Lament for a Hanging Man</strong></p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t the kind of opera I was expecting to listen to. Most of the operas I&#8217;ve listened to were composed before the 19th century. But this one, released in 1995, has a more modern vibe. The instruments used in the orchestra are diverse, including saxophones, bass clarinets, and percussion. This creates different sounds and rhythms that sometimes feel energetic and unpredictable, while other times they are more controlled and melodic. Overall, I liked it more than I was expecting. Especially the jazzy parts.</p>



<h3 id="indian" class="wp-block-heading">Indian</h3>



<p><strong>Ravi Shankar – Song From The Hills</strong></p>



<p>Besides the main differences of not having a common Western harmonic development, the difference I found insteresting in this music is the instrumentation. For example, in this piece, they use instruments like the tabla, which is a type of drum that creates rhythmic beats. It adds a lively and energetic feel to the music. There is also a shaking instrument that produces a shaking sound that adds some texture to the overall sound. Personally, I enjoyed listening to this piece and its unique style. However, since it doesn&#8217;t relate directly to my own culture, I couldn&#8217;t connect with it on a deep level. Even though this style of music may not be familiar to us, it can still be enjoyable to listen to and appreciate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Before we dive into the topic, I want to share a quick observation. When I first encountered the term &#8220;contemporary music,&#8221; my immediate thought was about classical contemporary music. However, I questioned myself and wondered why that was the case. What exactly is contemporary music? So, I researched, and the most satisfactory answer for me came from the Berkeley website, which defines contemporary music as an approach rather than a specific genre. It involves creating and performing rhythmically, harmonically, and texturally current music while incorporating diverse influences and cross-pollination of genres (Mirisola, 2019). </p>



<p>Living in Lisbon, a big city, offers many opportunities to enjoy live music by composers who are currently active. The Portuguese music scene is lively right now, with new composers emerging regularly, while still honoring established ones. What&#8217;s interesting is that Portugal, especially Lisbon, is a melting pot of cultures, and this diversity is reflected in the contemporary music scene. It&#8217;s amazing to witness the fusion of hip-hop and classical music, Cape Verdean melodies blending with fado, and even the recent combination of Flamenco and pop music. The physical spaces complement this musical movement, showing the interconnectedness of it all. There are more dedicated venues for contemporary music, both large ones like Centro Cultural de Belém and Gulbenkian, and smaller spaces throughout the city, even the streets themselves become stages for different composers.</p>



<p>Contemporary music analysis can be quite a challenge. We&#8217;ve seen throughout history that time plays a crucial role in determining its true worth. It needs the space to grow and evolve before we can make a fair judgment. That&#8217;s when we can truly grasp what will stand the test of time and hold cultural significance in the future. I understand that contemporary music serves as a mirror of our times, capturing the spirit and emotions of the present era. It thrives on pushing boundaries and challenging conventional norms, constantly evolving to reflect the changing world around us. But at times it may be challenging to fully grasp the intricacies of contemporary music. Whenever I come across contemporary music that doesn&#8217;t conform to the usual standards, my initial reaction tends to be one of hesitation. I find myself wondering if it&#8217;s using certain sounds and techniques just for the sake of it, without a clear purpose. But I make an effort to listen and try to understand its value. Let me share an example: when I first listened to Magnus Lindberg&#8217;s Kraft, I wasn&#8217;t immediately drawn in. It sounded like random noise, I have to admit. However, as I delved deeper into researching the composer, I realized the importance of considering it within the broader musical landscape. But that&#8217;s the analytical side of appreciating music. On an emotional level, I often find that the more unconventional the music, the less it captures my interest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Magnus Lindberg, born in 1958 in Helsinki, burst onto the global contemporary music scene in the early 80s, seamlessly blending different styles, from total serialism to rock.</p>



<p>Finland nurtured his composition career. He joined Sibelius Academy at 15, studying under Paavo Heininen, who fueled his interest in European trends. In 1977, he co-founded Korvat auki with Kaija Saariaho and Esa-Pekka Salonen. In 1980, he founded Toimii Ensemble a creative laboratory that became the birthplace of his innovative compositional experiments.</p>



<p>Mellor (2016) highlights the fascinating evolution of Lindberg&#8217;s compositional style. Over about two decades, he transitioned from an impassioned modernist to a &#8220;mellow composer&#8221; who crafts exquisite orchestral pieces with hints of Romanticism.</p>



<p>After his studies, he travelled to Paris and Berlin, where he discovered punk rock and specifically the German metal band Einstürzende Neubauten. This exposure changed his musical style, turning him into an &#8220;angry modernist,&#8221; (Mellor, 2016) as reflected in his most ambitious composition, Kraft (1985), written for orchestra, electronics, and junkyard percussion. When I heard it, I understood why it is considered such a powerful piece. It radiates tremendous strength, astonishing the listener with its bold changes in dynamics. It brought to mind Stravinsky&#8217;s Rite of Spring, but went even further in terms of instrumentation and a feeling of aggression. While I didn&#8217;t find it as captivating as Rite of Spring overall, there were elements, particularly at the start of each section, that I enjoyed.</p>



<p>In 1994, he composed Aura, a symphony in four movements for a large orchestra. As I listened to each part, I noticed something unexpected—it seemed closer to Rite of Spring rather than moving further away. Interestingly, I even recognized a hint of the famous Rite of Spring rhythm around the ninth minute of the first movement in the recording by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. On the whole, there is a sense of clarity, balance, and harmony that sharply contrasts with Kraft. If I had to guess how Lindberg&#8217;s sound would evolve ten years after Kraft, I would have imagined a greater emphasis on electronic elements rather than acoustic ones. This pleasant surprise increased my admiration for Aura.</p>



<p>In 2002, he created the Clarinet Concerto, which garnered positive reviews from the critics I read. Surprisingly, it is his most popular piece on Spotify. And I can see why. Compared to the previous two compositions, this piece felt more approachable, melodious, and well-structured. The instrumentation has a more traditional quality. It felt like a refined version of Aura. According to Clemments (2005), this single-movement work is sprinkled with allusions to other composers. Although I may not possess the musical knowledge to identify them, I was delighted to recognize the reference to Gershwin&#8217;s Rhapsody in Blue. Actually, that was my favourite part of this piece.</p>



<p>Overall, I was delighted to meet Magnus Lindberg. One thing that stood out in the compositions I listened to was his ability to combine tension/release. His music slowly builds up suspense, and then it bursts forth with pure joy. But what matters to me is how this demonstrates that artists can evolve and freely change their sound without being tied to a specific style. It reminded me of an interview with Rosalía where she says that she couldn&#8217;t do two similar albums because she desires to showcase her diverse emotions across different moments in time. It&#8217;s truly a testament to artistic evolution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tchaikovsky&#8217;s Seasons is probably the less known &#8220;seasons&#8221; of major composers. My opinion is that, because they were composed for a bigger audience, including amateurs, they lack the virtuosity and complexity that pianists prefer in order to showcase their skills.</p>



<p>The collection was composed between November 1875 and May 1876 and commissioned by Nikolay Matveyevich Bernard, the publisher of Le Nouvelliste, a monthly music magazine in St. Petersburg. The intention of the publisher was to release one piece per month, but Tchaikovsky wrote the majority of the pieces between April and May 1876.</p>



<p>In opposition to Vivaldi&#8217;s &#8220;The Four Seasons&#8221;, Tchaikovsky&#8217;s seasons are composed of 12 pieces, each one dedicated to each month of the year, showcasing a glimpse of something characteristic of the month, for example, Carnival (February), The Harvest (August) or Christmas (December).</p>



<p>I would not say that this romantic work is programmatic, but one cannot definitely distance himself from the theme of each piece and hear it as absolute music.</p>



<p>My thoughts after listening to each piece:</p>



<ul>
<li>January: Warm, cosy, and familiar, Evokes a feeling of being at home with the cold outside, warmed by a fireplace and surrounded by loved ones.</li>



<li>February: Playful, cheery, festive. Just like Carnival should be.</li>



<li>March: Melancholic and distant, evoking a sense of reflection for the cold month of March.</li>



<li>April: Charming and optimistic. The end of winter means the start of spring.</li>



<li>May: Serene and tranquil, but warm just like the nights of May.</li>



<li>June: There&#8217;s a certain melancholy in this piece that I find beautiful. It looks like a very romantic piece.</li>



<li>July: The summer spirit is present with a catchy and cheerful tone.</li>



<li>August: The initial and final sections of this piece weren&#8217;t to my liking. It feels chaotic and excessively flourishing for my taste.</li>



<li>September: Majestic and spirited. It resembles a fanfare that complements the eerie ambience of this time of year.</li>



<li>October: Among the pieces in this set, this one evokes a particularly somber mood, but is my favourite. Winter is coming.</li>



<li>November: Somehow, the beggining, reminds me of impressionist pieces. It showcases familiar tunes and notable variations.</li>



<li>December: A refined and courteous waltz-like composition, that brings a warm and festive sensation.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, I think Tchaikovsky successfully captured the essence of each month, while also preserving a sense of coherence throughout the entire composition. It was a fantastic initial listening, and I eagerly anticipate revisiting it in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dark Knight, the second film of the Dark Knight Trilogy, is one of my favourite movies. The reason I love it is that it portrays both the hero and villain as flawed, human characters with blurred lines between good and bad. However, I had never watched it with a focus on the music until now.</p>



<p>Composed by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, the music beautifully captures the duality of the characters. Acoustic instruments (mostly orchestral instruments) dominate when Bruce Wayne appears, while electronic instruments (ranging from electric guitars to synthesizers and audio effects) take over when Batman is present. This stark contrast creates a tranquil atmosphere for Bruce and intense action sequences for Batman.</p>



<p>Intense scenes often feature string ostinati or percussive 16th-note rhythms. Ostinati create sonic continuity when using shorter note values and busy rhythms, they enhance forward momentum and drive.</p>



<p>Despite the complex character development, the main characters&#8217; motifs are remarkably simple. Batman&#8217;s motif consists of two notes (D-F), and the Joker&#8217;s motif is a single note (D). These motifs are strategically used throughout the film to highlight each character&#8217;s presence and convey their essence.</p>



<p>Batman&#8217;s motif, often played by brass with digital effects, brings brightness and hope. It signifies his moments of triumph, like emerging unscathed from the Batmobile crash. On the other hand, the Joker&#8217;s motif, a single note played by a processed cello and razorblade-driven electric guitar, creates a nervy, unsettling feeling akin to an ever-present mosquito. Sometimes the note ascends aimlessly over the D drone, capturing Joker&#8217;s anarchist mindset.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="194" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-1024x194.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1596" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-1024x194.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-300x57.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-768x146.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-640x121.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49-960x182.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-20.57.49.png 1298w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The film&#8217;s core message is that Batman and the Joker are not as different as they seem. Analyzing these motifs made me realize that musically they are related as well.  Both motifs start with the same note, D, but Batman&#8217;s controlled ascent to F contrasts with the Joker&#8217;s anarchic, uncontrollable rise.</p>



<p>This exercise was enjoyable, and it sparked my interest in analyzing how Batman and his villains have been musically portrayed over time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Japanese traditional music, also called hōgaku, is generally defined as all Japanese musical forms from the 10th century,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Japanese traditional music, also called <em>hōgaku</em>, is generally defined as all Japanese musical forms from the 10th century, until the introduction of Western music. But the consensus is that the term <em>hōgaku</em> refers to traditional Japanese music made during or after Japan’s Edo Period (17th to mid-19th centuries) (Sonosky, 2013).</p>



<p>During my research, I found an article by Britten Dean (1985) that discusses Japanese traditional music. According to Dean, unfamiliar Western listeners often perceive it as monotonous, aimless, and shrill. The author attributes this perception to five main differences compared to Western music: monophony, scales, noise, singing, and subtlety. While a detailed explanation can be found in the article, a brief overview is enough to grasp the essential elements of this style.</p>



<p>Traditional Japanese instrumental music features unique instruments such as koto, shamisen (strings meant to be plucked), shakuhachi, fue, shinobue (types of flute), and percussion instruments like shimedaiko, okawa, and kotsuzumi.</p>



<p>Dean mentions that Japanese traditional music follows a long tradition of having a single melody without supporting chords. This can make the music seem thin and lack the progressive harmony that Western listeners expect. It may give the impression of simplicity, but an example provided by the author illustrates the complexity of a single melody. At times, the voice and accompaniment play the same melody but are intentionally desynchronized by a half-beat.</p>



<p>According to Dean, Japanese traditional music primarily relies on the pentatonic scale. This scale is evident in instruments like the five-hole shakuhachi and the tuning of the koto strings. Variations of the pentatonic scale (perhaps the equivalent of Western music modes) often result in a wider interval between the last note of the scale and the tonic, exceeding a whole step. Consequently, the prominence of the leading note is not as anticipated, giving the music a sense of lacking progression and purpose.</p>



<p>Dean also explores the idea of noise, highlighting its contrasting use in Japanese traditional music compared to Western music. While noise is typically avoided in Western music, it serves as an artistic expression in Japanese traditional music. For instance, when the shamisen&#8217;s string is struck by the plectrum, a subtle clicking sound is produced. Contemporary composers even push the boundaries by incorporating intentional beating and pounding of instruments to create a diverse range of sounds. Although these sounds may appear dissonant, they harmoniously blend with the music and are aesthetically pleasing.</p>



<p>Japanese traditional music is also known for its prominent vocal element, as the majority of compositions are sung. Unlike in Western music, Japanese singers do not focus on projecting their voices because there are fewer accompanying instruments. Furthermore, a convention dictates that singers should refrain from showing their teeth. As a result, Japanese singing is characterized by a gentle delivery and a narrower range of vocal dynamics compared to Western music.</p>



<p>Finally, subtlety is a prominent aspect of Japanese traditional music. In the past, hōgaku was intended for intimate settings with small audiences in compact spaces. As a result, the contrast in volume is minimized, and the extremes of the dynamic range are consciously avoided. This creates a sense of consistent and stable music, where the surprises lie within the subtle details.</p>



<p>In the end, I came to understand that while these features strongly contrast with Western music, there is one aspect that stands out as even more remarkable and contrasting. Traditional Japanese music has remained nearly unchanged for nine centuries, while Western music has undergone constant evolution. This leads me to believe it is a music deeply rooted in tradition, embracing gradual enhancements, and upholding a profound reverence for past composers.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Having familiarized myself with the notable aspects of hōgaku, I am now able to appreciate them through actual listening, as demonstrated in the aforementioned example. Sankyoku, a musical form involving a koto player who also sings, accompanied by a samisen and a shakuhachi, allows me to perceive the delicacy, ethereal quality, seemingly spontaneous nature, and monophonic texture. Moreover, I find it intriguing to observe the lack of synchronization between the vocals and instruments, a detail that had previously eluded my attention.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>After exploring additional compositions, I discovered that hōgaku possesses a wonderful sense of serenity, seriousness, and contemplation while maintaining a delicate balance and lightness.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There is no music that can be classified as inherently good or bad. In my perspective, art defies&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is no music that can be classified as inherently good or bad. In my perspective, art defies the notion of being labelled as incorrect. Poems, dances, sculptures—they can&#8217;t be deemed as wrong. The same applies to music; there is no right or wrong. Its value lies in the connection it forges with the listener. Interestingly, this notion was shared with me by a 19-year-old person I had a conversation. When I inquired about their perception of good and bad pop music, they responded by saying that good music must have a captivating rhythm and powerful meaning to themselves.</p>



<p>Considering this, it is really hard for me to tell what makes pop music good or bad. However, it is easier for me to distinguish between pop music I feel is relevant to me and the ones that don&#8217;t.</p>



<p>A truly good or relevant pop song must possess a blend of remarkable melodies, seamless harmonic progressions, grab the listeners&#8217; attention in the first seconds, and incorporate repetition. Above all, it should offer a touch of innovation, presenting a fresh perspective to the realm of music, thereby paving the way for future compositions.</p>



<p>My favourite example of pop music is Queen&#8217;s Bohemian Rhapsody. Despite being classified as Rock Music, it is also recognized as Progressive Pop due to its incorporation of various features from the Progressive Rock genre, including dramatic contrasts and frequent tempo shifts. Astonishingly, they managed to merge the three distinct sections of the song seamlessly, resulting in a cohesive piece with catchy melodies, captivating instrumentals, and powerful lyrics. For that reason, it is regarded as one of the most important songs of all time. Each time I listen to it, I am amazed by how effortlessly they transition between sections while still maintaining their distinctiveness. Furthermore, it has another remarkable feature for a pop song: it clocks in at nearly 6 minutes, yet it never feels lengthy.</p>



<p>Another example of excellent pop music, though in a contrasting genre, is Los Del Rio&#8217;s Macarena, specifically the Bayside Boys remix. This song epitomizes pop music at its finest. It dominated the charts in 1996 and even secured the No. 7 spot on Billboard&#8217;s All-Time Top 100 in 2012. With its catchy melody, simple two-chord harmony, and a blend of clave rhythm and techno beats, this song is undeniably pop. The Spanish-English lyrics are lively and empowering to women, contributing to the girl power movement alongside the Spice Girls. Furthermore, it had a lasting impact on Latin music for years to come. While it may not align with my taste nor be a song I would listen to repeatedly, I acknowledge that it possesses all the qualities of exceptional pop music.</p>



<p>A more recent example of great pop music is SZA&#8217;s Kill Bill, released in 2022. This song was an immediate success, spending 19 weeks in the top three of Billboard&#8217;s Hot 100. Its most remarkable aspect is the contrast of a truly beautiful melody with dark lyrics. This contrast is enhanced by an exquisite introduction, a captivating boom-bap rhythm, and simple harmonies. The song, superficially, sounds like a simple pop song but going into the complex composition, we find that it deviates from the typical structure and incorporates intentionally off-key instruments. It is this innovative compositional work that attracts me to the song, and it will likely serve as a trendsetter for similar music in the future.</p>



<p>Conversely, bad or irrelevant pop music is predictable, recycling previous musical forms, and attempting to ride the success trends of its time. In other words, it becomes excessively formulaic.</p>



<p>A recent example of a poor pop song is Meghan Trainor&#8217;s Mother. Following the success of her earlier hit, All About That Bass, which showcased innovative lyrics and messaging, Trainor attempted to replicate that triumph by creating a song that adheres almost identically to the formula of her previous success. It features the same rhythm, and excessively polished sound, and utilizes a familiar melody to increase its appeal. As a result, it comes across as mechanically produced, lacking the artist&#8217;s artistic vision, ultimately rendering it disposable.</p>



<p>Another instance is Rebecca Black&#8217;s Friday. Although it achieved tremendous popularity, it is widely regarded as one of the worst-recorded songs. The lyrics are superficial, the vocals are heavily processed with autotune, and the instrumentation feels synthetic. It is a song that becomes predictable from the very beginning and, in my opinion, it remains relevant today, but solely for its negative quality.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I believe that there are no inherently good or bad songs. However, certain characteristics differentiate the significance and relevance of music throughout the history of pop music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Composed in 1888, Gymnopédie No. 1 is one of three piano pieces. The term &#8220;gymnopédie&#8221; refers to a dance performed by young men in ancient Greece, characterized by their nudity. Satie&#8217;s music beautifully captures a sense of ethereal beauty and melancholic nostalgia.</p>



<p>As I learned in my previous studies, Satie influenced Debussy in rejecting the conventions and rules of the era. Gymnopédie No. 1 holds great historical significance as it marked a departure from the prevailing Romantic style of that time.</p>



<p>The composition revolves around a single musical idea, depicted in the image below. To me, it resembles a steady heartbeat that pervades the entire piece, setting its rhythm and atmosphere. Throughout the composition, I anticipated an eruption or a contrasting texture, like in Debussy&#8217;s Clair de Lune, but it never arrived. Even the melody lacks such contrast, with the only variety stemming from the harmony.</p>

<p>Interestingly, upon initial listening, the melody seems simplistic and somewhat predictable, while the harmonies are surprisingly unexpected. Although I couldn&#8217;t find a tonal centre, the music appears to shift between D Major and G Major, introducing delightful contrasts, such as the A minor.</p>

<p>After several listens, I find the music to be ethereal, creating a contemplative and soothing experience. The choice of the piano as the instrument contributes to this sensation, as it conveys tranquillity more effectively than an orchestra, such as Debussy&#8217;s orchestration. The absence of a narrative or progression in the music makes me wonder whether Satie paved the way for ambient music.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Defining pop music proves to be a more challenging task compared to defining classical music. The scope of classical music encompasses a wide range of definitions. For instance, Oxford Dictionaries defines classical music as &#8220;music written in a Western musical tradition, usually using an established form (for example a symphony).&#8221; Personally, I perceive classical music in a broader sense, encompassing compositions performed by traditional acoustic instruments without a vocal melody. On the contrary, pop music transcends the confines of a singular genre. Pop music, at its core, is music that is appreciated by a mass audience. When looking at the Music Genres Wikipedia entry, we discover that popular music encompasses numerous genres, with pop music serving as a sub-genre with dozens of genres in itself. As a result, the genres that constitute pop music have undergone continuous evolution since the mid-1950s. For instance, during the 1950s, rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll dominated the pop music scene, while in the early 1990s, Latin music took centre stage, and in the late 2000s, dance music emerged as a prominent force.</p>



<p>The main clash in the definition of pop and classical music is highlighted in the Oxford Dictionary of Music. According to the dictionary, &#8220;since the late 1950s (&#8230;) pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus[ic]&#8221; (Kennedy, 1994:686). This definition raises intriguing questions. Does it imply that there are only two distinct genres of music? Does it suggest that classical music can never attain the status of popular music?</p>



<p>Among the various articles I read on this topic, the one written by James O. Young, titled &#8220;How Classical Music is Better than Popular Music&#8221; (2016)  struck a chord with me. Although I must admit that I do not agree with the title, I agree with the article&#8217;s main argument. Young states that, in general, classical music is more expressive than pop music because it possesses more expressive resources. Classical compositions often boast a broader range of harmonic resources, including complex chord progressions, intricate counterpoint, and rich orchestration, thereby increasing their potential for &#8220;psychological insight and profundity&#8221; (Young, 2016).</p>



<p>For me, Young&#8217;s perspective can be summarized as variety.  Classical compositions tend to have fewer repetitions and more unexpected progressions compared to popular music. Given that the latter is tailored to a wide audience, it&#8217;s unsurprising that they have more repetitions and basic harmonic structures to make it easier to listen, memorize and enjoy. That makes me wonder if this is why modulation is becoming rarer in popular music.</p>



<p>Given this, it&#8217;s not surprising that classical music is frequently seen as superior to popular music. Usually, people tend to think that complex works are better than simpler ones, but this is a subjective belief that might not be entirely accurate. Creating something simple that resonates with a wide audience is a difficult task, and creating complexity just for the sake of it might not turn it into an interesting work.</p>



<p>When it comes to art, I tend to appreciate simpler works. I truly believe that simple art is not an easy art. When faced with Rococo architecture and Bauhaus buildings, my preference leans towards the latter. The same with painting, poetry and music. I find it truly captivating when an artist can express their perspectives and emotions through the simplicity of their art, thereby engaging a wider audience that may otherwise be pushed away from complexity.</p>



<p>In summary, I don&#8217;t believe that the question of good and bad music applies to a discussion about what differentiates popular music and classical music. These are two music genres, each encompassing multiple subgenres, with unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Classical music is expected to exhibit greater expressiveness, diversity, and intellectual depth. Popular music is expected to have the ability to appeal to a large audience and to be more accessible to composers. Given the choice, I would opt for pop music due to its democratic nature, benefiting both composers and listeners.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Trying to define music is a rabbit hole that many musicologists, ethnomusicologists, philosophers, musicians, music students, and others&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trying to define music is a rabbit hole that many musicologists, ethnomusicologists, philosophers, musicians, music students, and others alike, have fallen. Researching through Google and the UCA Library has confirmed this observation. The nature of music is inherently subjective, and it is as hard as attempting to define any other form of art.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it is a great exercise to do, especially when starting this unit.</p>



<p>To kick off this exercise, I went into the world of other people&#8217;s music definitions. I hopped from dictionary entries to books, interviews, essays, and opinion articles. Among the definitions I found, some were analytical and detached, such as the Concise Oxford Dictionary&#8217;s description as &#8220;the art of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion.&#8221; Other definitions had a philosophical tone, such as Beethoven&#8217;s perspective that &#8220;Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy.&#8221; I also encountered spiritual viewpoints, like Charlie Parker&#8217;s belief that &#8220;Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom.&#8221; I even came across thought-provoking definitions, such as Frank Zappa&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;Anything can be music.&#8221;</p>



<p>This helped form my own opinion about how I would define music. </p>



<p>Music can be characterized by elements that are relatively easier to define, such as rhythm, melody, and harmony. These components are concrete, measurable, and easy to categorize. And we can indeed say that if these elements are present, it can be identified as music. However, deep down, I intuitively know that music is much more than the sum of those elements. Music transcends the boundaries of its components. So, what is music?</p>



<p>In order for music to exist, it requires three essential participants: the composer, the performer, and the listener. Interestingly, these roles can sometimes be fulfilled by the same person. Think of a pianist improvising alone in a room. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the composer and performer don&#8217;t need to be exclusively human. Take the example of a bird joyfully singing its song. Yet, when it comes to the listener in this trio, it must be a human being. A bird cannot claim to be truly listening to music, as it lacks the rational capacity to understand the emotional impact behind the composition and performance. Only a human listener has the rational ability to identify and appreciate the emotional effect that those sounds, can have. Thus, I maintain that the definition of music is largely shaped by the listener rather than just by the sounds.</p>



<p>Of course, it is fair to say that this definition could be challenged, considering that people who are deaf cannot physically hear music. However, they possess the remarkable ability to perceive and discern the presence of music through alternative means, such as vibrations. That is precisely why I intentionally used the term &#8220;listen&#8221; instead of &#8220;hear.&#8221; A deaf person can listen to music by other meanings other than using their ears. </p>



<p>If I were to draft an analytical and impartial definition of music, it would say that music is a compilation of sounds crafted by a composer and executed by a performer, which holds emotional significance for a human listener.</p>



<p>However, personally, I find myself drawn to a definition that carries a touch more spirit. Ultimately, I gravitate towards the perspective offered by Frank Zappa. I would say that music is anything that the listener decides is music.</p>

</h2>



<p>The feedback from my tutor was generally positive, with a focus on cautioning against pushing the harmonic rules too far. The tutor also emphasized the importance of understanding the use of dissonances and suggested exploring the incorporation of mordents to introduce more character into the piece, instead of the abundance of trills.</p>



<p>Taking these comments into consideration, I proceeded to revise both the score and my own reflections. In terms of the score, I aimed to simplify it, recognizing that certain passages appeared overcrowded and could benefit from enhanced clarity. Specifically, I addressed the conclusion by removing a trill that contained a leap to the final G note. However, I retained an ornament in the last bar, which I believe now presents a more elegant and Bach-inspired style.</p>



<p>Other alterations:</p>



<p>In bars 1 and 2, instead of having a descending sequence, I repeated the notes of the Right Hand in each chord to establish better the harmony.</p>



<p>In bar 6 I changed the G octave to a F octave in the violin to fit the Bb chord beneath.</p>



<p>In bar 7, I changed the Right Hand to start the arpeggio in an E flat instead of G, to create a descending sequence from the previous bars.</p>



<p>In bars 10 and 11 I changed the Right Hand line to become more smooth.</p>



<p>In bars 15-16 and bar 23-24 I replaced the long and unresolved note with a resolution.</p>



<p>In bar 20 and bar 30 I replaced the trill with a mordent.</p>



<p></p>

</h2>



<p>I approached this assignment by first thinking about the piece&#8217;s structure, drawing inspiration from Bach&#8217;s violin sonata. I researched various baroque dances, such as the Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, and Gigue, and decided to use the Allemande as a primary inspiration because of its 4/4 meter and binary form. After going through the chords several times, I decided to make my piece in binary form as well: the first section from bar 1 to bar 16 and the second from bar 17 to bar 33.</p>



<p>I chose the first section to be 16 bars long, as this is a common length for the first section of dances like Allemande and Bach&#8217;s sonata. Additionally, the perfect cadence from bar 15 (C major) to bar 16 (F major) and the transition from F major to Bb major in bar 17 made it a logical choice. The presence of rehearsal letters also hinted that there would be a break in this section.</p>



<p>As soon as I determined the structure of my composition, <a href="./../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" target="_blank">I reviewed my previous analysis of Bach&#8217;s violin sonata to better understand his techniques</a>. </p>



<p>My composition plan was to introduce the main theme of the sonata in the first bars and then explore it with repetitions and variations until the end of the A section. The B section would start with a similar theme, but with some slight changes to keep it fresh and then move to the main theme until the end of the piece.</p>



<p>One of the challenges I faced right at the beginning of the composition was finding the right rhythms and notes. I tried several combinations and ideas but I ended up feeling that they didn&#8217;t match the Baroque style I was aiming for. Either sounded too simple or too uninteresting. My solution was to borrow material from my previous exercise, which was based on Bach&#8217;s Sonata for Viola da Gamba &amp; Harpsichord in G Minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="676" height="242" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1165" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png 676w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-300x107.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-640x229.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Exercise 3.4 theme</figcaption></figure>



<p>But even after finding a theme, I wasn&#8217;t satisfied with how it sounded in the first four bars, so I decided to begin it at rehearsal mark A (bar 5) and develop it from there. Overall, I was pleased with how the melody turned out and specifically enjoyed applying the lessons I learned from Bach by allowing the C# in bar 8 to move to bar 9 instead of resolving to D.</p>



<p>There was a challenge with the first 4 bars since I lacked ideas as to what to do in order to make them interesting. My solution was to write an introduction that hinted at the main theme&#8217;s rhythm, as a preview of what was to come. Despite not being able to find out whether an introduction was common to the Baroque style, I decided to include it since it made sense in this composition.</p>



<p>My goal in the B section was to make the violin sound freer, but not totally different from the previous section. In order to achieve this, I kept the tied note and the three descending notes from the main theme.</p>



<p>The next step was ornamenting the violin and the treble harpsichord. I looked into Taylor (1998), Apel (1969) and Bach (1949) for guidance and kept in mind that Bach used ornaments that were perfectly in time. The main difficulty I faced was understanding how to write the first and final notes on the trills regarding the previous and the next note. For example, in bars 2 and 12, the previous note is the same upper note of the trill. Should the player play it two times or make it tied? I couldn&#8217;t find a definitive answer but it made sense to me to be tied.</p>

<p>In bars 29 and 30, I decided to incorporate a suspiran, which is a technique I learned from an article by Peter Williams (1979).</p>

<p>Overall, I am pleased with how I was able to incorporate elements from Bach&#8217;s sonata into my composition, but I am aware that it may not sound as authentically Baroque as it could. Sometimes it sounds too contemporary. Possibly the pivotal question is this: How can we write in the style of a specific era if we have been influenced by later ones? This may be a constant challenge that composers face, and it&#8217;s something that I kept in mind throughout the composition process. Despite this, I am happy with the final result and how it captures the essence of the Baroque style while incorporating my own creative choices.</p>

<p>After receiving feedback from my tutor, it became evident that the second species exercise required more work. The tutor highlighted that the melody felt like it was split in two and also drew attention to the downward direction following a leap. With these feedbacks in mind, I proceeded to rework the second species exercise.</p>



<h4 id="first-species" class="wp-block-heading">First Species</h4>



<p>Using the tips from the First Species, I created a melodic line that was always consonant and moved mostly in contrary motion.</p>

<h4 id="second-species" class="wp-block-heading">Second Species</h4>



<p>This was my second attempt at this exercise. My attention was on bar 3 and 4, where I aimed to establish a connection between the melody and the required D note in bar 4. I chose to make a leap in bar 3, followed by an ascending and descending line, resulting in a melody that fluctuates between C and G.</p>

<h4 id="third-species" class="wp-block-heading">Third Species</h4>



<p>Due to the pre-given patterns in bar 4  (nota cambiata pattern) and bar 6 (double neighbour pattern) in the third species, I started this species backwards in bar 6. Even with the given patterns, I tried to maintain a fluid melodic line with no big leaps, and always respected the previous species&#8217; guidelines.</p>

<h4 id="fourth-species" class="wp-block-heading">Fourth Species</h4>



<p>Since the suspension must be resolved downwards and in consonance with the upbeat, I found this one to be the easiest species.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As compared to the previous species, the fifth one took me a lot lI wasn&#8217;t sure how the bass and alto should harmonize with the tenor while imitating each other. Jacob Gran&#8217;s video helped me realize we should make the three-voice counterpoint as harmonically complete as possible. Thus, for example, in bar 3, the bass is supposed to imitate the tenor by going from D to F, but that would be dissonant. The right choice is E since it makes a C major triad.</p>

</h2>



<p>This assignment provided me with significant learning outcomes, enriching my understanding of the piece and expanding my research skills. Given my background in writing, I find it more comfortable and efficient to compose an essay rather than a musical piece. Once again, I found the word limit somewhat restrictive for what I wanted to write, but I recognize that such constraints serve to ensure the essay remains focused on essential aspects.</p>



<p>Regarding my research method, I began by listening to the Symphony, using my ears to identify themes, sections, key changes, and other musical elements. Then I researched books and articles to gain a historical understanding of the piece. Finally, I applied a method of analysis I used before, identifying the form, themes, and keys, outlining the structure, establishing how the transitions of keys and sections are made and analysing how themes are built and used throughout the piece.</p>



<p>The feedback from my tutor proved pivotal in transforming what the tutor described as &#8220;a very good start to your analytical writing&#8221; into what I believe to be a well-structured and cohesive essay. Each comment offered new perspectives that hadn&#8217;t occurred to me before, which led to extensive revisions and additions to the essay.</p>



<p>The most important comment was to structure the essay around a central theme, accompanied by a suitable title and introduction. Although this advice seemed obvious upon reading it, it hadn&#8217;t initially occurred to me. Initially, I attempted to provide a comprehensive overview of the piece, resulting in numerous questions. With the help of my tutor, I selected one of those questions and reoriented my essay around the concept of Tone-painting or the &#8220;expression of a feeling.&#8221;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the feedback provided valuable guidance on areas to focus on during my research. For instance, the comment and question raised by my tutor regarding my strangeness when I found the brief key change to a minor key in the development section prompted further investigation into the sonata form, leading me to discover the book &#8220;Elements of Sonata Theory.&#8221; This reference provided answers to that particular question and others I had.</p>



<p>In conclusion, this assignment stands out as one of the most impactful learning experiences I have encountered thus far.</p>

		<span>Tone-painting or the &#8220;expression of a feeling&#8221;? Beethoven&#8217;s Sixth Symphony, First Movement</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>This essay explores the historical and musical aspects that help understand the nuanced connection between tone-painting and emotional expression in Beethoven&#8217;s Sixth Symphony, Op. 68 “Pastoral”. Through an analysis of the 1st movement of the Symphony, this essay aims to demonstrate how Beethoven masterfully blends these two concepts to create a musical composition that is both vibrant and sensitively emotive.</p>



<p>The Pastoral Symphony, composed between 1807 and 1808, falls within the middle of Beethoven&#8217;s second phase, which was influenced by the turbulent sociopolitical events of the Enlightenment era, personal struggles such as the onset of his deafness, and its cultural context as part of the transition from the Classical to Romantic music period.</p>



<p>Premiered in Vienna on December 22nd 1808, during a concert at which several of other major works by the composer were premiered including his 5th Symphony, the Pastoral Symphony is written for a typical orchestra of that period: piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones, timpani and strings (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1998a). </p>



<p>Since they both premiered at the same concert and were composed at around the same time, the contrast between the 5th Symphony and 6th Symphony is worth noting. The 5th is vigorous and varied, while the 6th is calm and repetitive, with programmatic titles illustrating rural life. Also, unlike the 5th Symphony, Beethoven gave his 6th an epithet: &#8220;Pastoral&#8221;.</p>



<p>In order to understand why Beethoven decided to use the Pastoral as the theme for this Symphony, one must consider the intersection of his personal history and the historical context in which he was creating. On the personal side, according to Allen (2017), Beethoven had a profound love for nature and often sought refuge from the bustle of urban life by retreating to the countryside. But in a historical context, Will (1994:166) states that the pastoral theme was the most common subject in programmatic symphonies during the Classical Period, and although there were earlier works such as Justin Heinrich Knecht&#8217;s 1784 symphony &#8220;Le portrait musical de la nature,&#8221; which shares a similar programmatic intent with Beethoven&#8217;s 6th Symphony, Beethoven might have found inspiration in Haydn&#8217;s great oratorios The Creation (1799) and The Seasons (1801) (Lockwood, 2015). However, in opposition to other programmatic symphonies, Beethoven intended this work to be “more the Expression of Feeling than Tone-Panting”.</p>



<p>Distinguishing between tone-painting and expression of feeling is crucial. According to Will (2002:130), expression involves imitating emotions, while painting involves replicating the sounds or movements of physical objects. The debate surrounding tone-painting in music gained significant attention in the late 18th century, leading to criticism from various English and German writers, including arguments such as &#8220;painting violates the true spirit of music, which ought to express the sentiments of feeling, not convey ideas of inanimate objects&#8221; (Sulzer 1792–94, II: 357 cited in Will, 2002:131).</p>



<ol start="6">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Two reviews from 1810, published in Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung (AmZ) and Zeitung für die elegante Welt, shed light on the debate surrounding tone-painting and expression of feeling in Beethoven&#8217;s Pastoral Symphony. While initially denouncing it as &#8220;the utmost in tastelessness,&#8221; the AmZ review later justifies Beethoven&#8217;s use of tone-painting to represent emotions, rather than physical objects.  (Will, 1994:158-160). Similarly, the review published in the Zeitung für die elegante Welt acknowledges that the symphony portrays emotions associated with the pastoral but it goes further to argue that it is more than a generic representation of such emotions. Rather, the scenes depicted are specific episodes from the composer&#8217;s own experiences in the countryside, imbued with his personal emotions. (Will, 1994:161).</p>



<p>Both reviews share a common acknowledgement of Beethoven&#8217;s utilization of tone-painting in his Pastoral Symphony, evident in instances like the storm in the 4th movement and the depiction of birds in the 2nd movement. However, they both consider Beethoven&#8217;s tone-painting to be of secondary significance, with the primary emphasis placed on its ability to convey emotions associated with the pastoral theme.</p>



<p>The pastoral style, as discussed by Adolf Sandberger and stated by Frank Eugene Kirby (1970:612-613), incorporates various elements such as &#8220;bird-call themes, hunting-horn themes, shepherds&#8217; pipes&#8230; and shepherds&#8217; calls&#8230;, country dances, &#8230; and&#8230; the bagpipe with its drone bass.&#8221; He also states that &#8220;the lilting dotted rhythm of the siciliano was frequently associated with the representation of the pastoral, as were flutes, oboes, and horns. Melodic motion in parallel thirds was also common&#8221;. </p>



<p>Robert Hatten (2004:83) highlights the historical precedent for the formal treatment of the pastoral theme through distinctive musical elements such as &#8220;greater consonance, simpler harmonies, pedal points, more-flowing melodic lines&#8221; and also rocking compound accompaniment, harmonic stasis, and melody in parallel thirds.</p>



<p>While each movement of Beethoven&#8217;s Symphony can be analyzed to understand how Beethoven used the music to convey the pastoral theme and elicit associated emotions, Lockwood (2015) defends that the 1st movement &#8220;exemplifies what Beethoven meant when he wrote “More the expression of feelings than tone-painting.”</p>



<p>The 1st movement of the Symphony, titled &#8220;Awakening of Cheerful Feelings upon Arrival in the Country,&#8221; serves as a joyful prelude, devoid of explicit programmatic features found in other movements. It features simple melodies and a light rhythm, with homophonic orchestration and primarily major keys, creating an atmosphere that transmits a cheerful pastoral quality. To depict the tranquillity of awakening in nature, Beethoven minimizes unexpected shifts, employs extensive repetitions, and only briefly uses a minor key.</p>

Click to amplify.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first movement follows the sonata form structure, as illustrated in Figure 1. Set in the key of F major, this choice holds a significant historical association with compositions inspired by nature, as noted by Geck (2017:105).</p>



<p>The introduction starts with a theme, that can be considered the first theme of the first subject area. This theme may have been inspired by a Serbian folk song called &#8220;Sirvonja&#8221; (Geck, 2017:107). The initial four bars come to a halt by means of the fermata over a sustained C major chord, dominant of F major.</p>

<p>In the first 4 bars, there are several musical elements that convey the pastoral theme: folk-like melody, drone bass, greater consonance, (briefly) melody in thirds and the key of F.</p>



<p>By bar 5, the second theme belonging to the first subject area is introduced in the violas, accompanied by the violins that employ pre-existing motific material from the first theme. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1400" width="324" height="106" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804.png 648w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804-300x98.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.19.49-e1682682783804-640x209.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The second theme of the first subject area played by the violas at bars 5-7</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within the initial 12 bars of the movement, Beethoven introduces the two principal themes that will serve as a significant guide throughout the piece, in addition to some hints of the motif&#8217;s development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1401" width="487" height="471" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24.png 974w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-300x290.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-768x743.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-640x619.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-960x928.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The first violins play a motific variation and the strings play the second theme of the first subject area at bars 8-12</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 16 comes an unexpected repetition on the strings. The first violins play the same rhythm as the second bar of the first theme, which lasts for 13 bars. The sole variation lies in the dynamics. This provides an indication of Beethoven&#8217;s approach to the symphony, characterized by repetitions and harmonic stasis, which is another feature of the pastoral theme (Hatten, 2004:98).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="265" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-1024x265.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1402" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-1024x265.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-300x78.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-768x199.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-1536x398.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-640x166.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33-960x249.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-09.47.33.png 1692w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The repetition on the violins at bars 17-22</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 29, the exposition section starts with a subdued presentation of the first theme initiated by the oboe, with the cellos and horns providing support. This theme is subsequently passed through the orchestra going through the clarinets and bassoons and finally with the strings. Notably, a sense of repetition is evident, as the same rhythm of the third bar of the first theme is repeated in the woodwinds and violins. However, the dynamics make all the difference in not making it seem stale.</p>

<p>At bar 46, Beethoven employs his first instance of tone-painting in the symphony, with the flutes performing a birdsong. This technique, however, is used sparingly throughout the first movement, with only one other occurrence observed during the recapitulation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1404" width="555" height="107" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05.png 740w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05-300x58.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05-640x123.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Birdsong on the flutes at bars 46-48</figcaption></figure>



<p>Suddenly, at bar 53, a change in texture occurs as the clarinets and bassoons, followed by the horns, introduce a triplet theme, played over the rhythm of the first bar of the first theme.   </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-1024x258.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1405" width="640" height="161" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-1024x258.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-300x76.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-768x194.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-640x161.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-960x242.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53.png 1364w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The horns play triples while the first violins play a variation of the first theme at bars 55-62</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 67, a traditional sonata change to the dominant key of C marks the beginning of the second subject area. The first theme is introduced by the first violin and subsequently transferred to all string instruments, followed by all woodwinds. This part brings a “rocking accompaniment” in the strings which is one of the pastoral’s general qualities, as stated before.</p>



<p>In bar 93, Beethoven introduces the second theme of the second subject area, which is characterized by a clear question-and-answer structure between the strings and woodwinds. The dynamics employed in this structure are noteworthy, as the question is played f while the answer is played p.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-1024x241.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1407" width="640" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-1024x241.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-300x71.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-768x181.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-640x151.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-960x226.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58.png 1375w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The oboe provides an answer to the first violins question at bars 93-99</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bar 111 marks the return of the triplets, providing a sense of a faster rhythm and subsequently leading to a prolonged repetition over a C pedal tone, another pastoral feature. The first two bars of the first theme of the first subject area are then repeated, which results in a substantial build-up of tension.</p>



<p>The development section starts at bar 151, marked by the modulation to Bb Major and the reappearance of the triplet rhythm, along with a slightly varied part of the second bar of the first theme of the first subject area. Notably, the development section is an unconventional deviation from the traditional expectation of dramatic and innovative contrast to the exposition. Instead, it features a static and repetitive section transposed into different keys. It actually reminded me of the Prelude in Wagner&#8217;s Das Rheingold, which builds in the intensity of dynamics and instrumentation while maintaining a constant motif.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-1024x631.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1409" width="512" height="316" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-1024x631.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-300x185.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-768x473.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-1536x946.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-640x394.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-960x591.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17.png 1734w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The strings repetition at bars 154-159</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bar 237 marks a key change to A Major where both the first and second themes from the first subject area make an appearance. The second theme is subsequently repeated, leading to a brief modulation to the minor key at bar 255, and finally to C Major at bar 263. While some might contend that the brief modulation to the minor key gives the development section the expected dramatism, it is, in fact, brief and it&#8217;s not repeated again.</p>



<p>Hepokoski and Darcy (2011:197) state that in major mode sonatas, it is common for the development sections to incorporate shifts towards more &#8220;dramatic&#8221; minor mode regions. However, it can be inferred that Beethoven intentionally avoided such expressive contrasts in the development of this movement, as it would have contradicted the serene and pastoral atmosphere he sought to create.</p>



<p>At bar 282, the music reaches a moment of pause, with only the violin playing a trill, suggesting the arrival of the recapitulation and the return of the first theme. However, the second theme from the first subject area reappears, leaving the listener uncertain about whether the development section has ended. There&#8217;s a sense of false start, through persistent repetition that builds in dynamics, until the first theme from the first subject is ultimately played by all the instruments of the orchestra featured in the movement at bar 312, thereby indicating the start of the recapitulation.</p>



<p>The recapitulation goes back, as expected in classical sonata form, to both subject areas but in the tonic key of F Major. Notably, Beethoven chooses to initiate this section with a ff dynamic, rather than following the softer dynamic of the exposition, thereby contradicting the expectations. In the final stages of the recapitulation, the dynamics and texture gradually decrease, leading to a reduced level of tension as the music moves towards the coda.</p>



<p>The coda starts in bar 418 with a modulation to Bb Major, the subdominant, which was common in Beethoven (Hepokoski and Darcy, 2011:285), before bringing it back to the tonic in measure 440. Beethoven utilizes dynamics that range from pp to ff, which creates a sense of uncertainty regarding the music&#8217;s conclusion, as he plays with the audience&#8217;s expectations. This leaves uncertainty about the end of the music until the orchestra ends playing in a soft and comforting F major chord. </p>



<p>Engel, in his brilliant insight on the matter, proposes the idea that &#8220;painting is expression.&#8221; (Will, 2002:136). This concept explores the harmonious alignment between our inner emotions and the external world, opening the door to an aesthetic validation of tone-painting. This inherent duality implies that Beethoven could not effectively convey pastoral sentiments without employing some form of tone-painting. Particularly in the first movement, he skillfully incorporates musical techniques and occasional imitations of natural sounds, enabling listeners to recognize and appreciate the pastoral feelings within the composition. Ultimately, the true essence of Beethoven&#8217;s Sixth Symphony lies beyond an imitation of nature. Instead, it embodies a deep longing for the inner peace and serenity that nature invokes.</p>

<p>The tutor&#8217;s feedback was generally positive, describing the reflection as engaging. I made minor revisions primarily focused on grammar and clarity, and also addressed the two points raised by the tutor.</p>



<p>Regarding the question of whether composers should learn all past techniques before pursuing their own ideas, I posed a further question on how education can strike the right balance between tradition and innovation. Should it even strive for that balance? It&#8217;s an open question that invites further exploration. Unfortunately, due to the word count limit, I couldn&#8217;t delve deeper into it.</p>



<p>Another valuable comment from the tutor related to the Church&#8217;s concerns about the potential consequences of unchecked musical creativity. I incorporated an answer to that within the paragraph discussing the Church&#8217;s control over music.</p>

<p>Upon reading Stravinsky&#8217;s quote, I understood it quite intuitively. Due to my advertising background, most of the creative challenges I faced had constraints, so this subject is dear to me. In my experience, it was the &#8220;open challenges,&#8221; those without boundaries or limitations, that were the hardest to overcome.</p>



<p>Considering I could explore the theme more, the 500-word limit felt a bit short to me. There is a lot to discuss about rules&#8217; effectiveness, human bodies and instruments as extrinsic limitations, rules&#8217; roles in AI music composition, and if there is a right amount of restriction that promotes creativity. Nevertheless, I realized that a 500-word essay about constraints needs a constraint, so I summarized my main points.</p>



<p>Throughout this essay, the term &#8220;constraint&#8221; can take on many forms, including &#8220;rule,&#8221; &#8220;limit,&#8221; or &#8220;boundary.&#8221; Nonetheless, the underlying significance remains consistent— a set of both extrinsic and intrinsic inhibitions that an artist encounters while employing a creative medium.</p>

<p>In this quote, Stravinsky was saying that all creativity revolves around solving problems (<meta charset="utf-8"></meta>Harnad et al., 2008). I believe he was arguing that for creativity to reach its full potential, there must be some tension that calls for resolution. Many artists from different eras and fields, including Mozart (Blanning, 2016), Frank Gehry (Hereld, 2013), and John Stweart (NPR, 2015), have defended the same position: Constraints and problems are essential for artists so that they can find solutions that will produce knowledge.</p>



<p>What artists develop within these limitations and rules depends on their goals and skills. Beethoven broke them (Page, 2019). Gesualdo bent them (Ross, 2011). John Cage created new ones (Savenko, 2021). However, one thing unites them all. Each of them mastered the rules before creating beyond them. This raises an intriguing question regarding how creative education can or should achieve an optimal balance between honouring tradition and fostering innovation.</p>



<p>Even when one considers musical genres, it becomes apparent that they too need rules. New musical genres are created when &#8220;socially accepted rules&#8221; are set over the traditional ones (Fabbri, 1980). There is always a cycle: established rules are mastered; then they are questioned; then new rules are developed.</p>



<p>This was evident when monophonic masses were replaced by polyphonic ones. It was a breaking of the rules of a single melodic line that led to the establishment of new rules by the Church at the Council of Trent (1545-1563) and mastered by Palestrina (Monson, 2002). During the 16th Century, these formal rules led to a strictness in compositional technique, which led to a controlled and accessible sound but also one that was predictable. This doesn&#8217;t mean that the rules were demeaning the music, but they were purely a necessity for the Church to standardize music during the Renaissance (Mock, 2017), which was a time of profound creative and cultural shifts. The Church feared heresy and deviation from established doctrine, social disorder and spiritual manipulation. To mitigate these risks, the Church imposed rules such as counterpoint to maintain authority and conformity.</p>



<p>To assist composers in learning these contrapuntal compositional techniques of the 16th Century, Johann-Joseph Fux authored in 1725 the Gradus ad Parnassum, during a time when composers refused &#8220;to be bound by any rules or principles&#8221; (Fux et al., 1971). They are known as species counterpoint and have been a part of the learning of Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn (Norman, nd) and my own learning as well.</p>



<p>To learn and implement these rules, I found it most helpful to understand the &#8220;why&#8221; behind them. For example, understanding why consecutive fifths and octaves, and unison passages can render the music too dull and boring makes it easier to remember than simply stating &#8220;do not use successive fifths and octaves, or unison passages&#8221;. As well as this, I relied on the progressive learning method, where one learns by doing (Kennedy, 2019). This made learning easier by increasing the difficulty one step at a time and letting my mind become accustomed to the rules as I progressed.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the rules and constraints proved to be beneficial to me, as they helped me learn different harmonization and melodic concepts, and proved effective since I was able to compose much faster than I would without them. They also proved useful in helping me become more creative as I learned to solve some musical problems and maybe even come up with new ones in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Upon watching an Instagram Reel by David Asher Brown on Venezuelan merengue and its unique 5/8 rhythm, I decided to explore one of the genre&#8217;s most renowned compositions, Acidito. The song was composed by Adelis Fréitez and has been popularized by several singers and bands. </p>



<p>Cecilia Todd Vallenilla is a well-known Venezuelan musician, recognized for her performances of traditional Venezuelan folk music. She is especially skilled in playing the cuatro, which she uses to accompany herself in performances both within Venezuela and abroad.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>Upon close listening, it became clear that the 5/8 rhythm of Venezuelan merengue, as described by David Asher Brown, feels natural without any apparent sense of strain. The natural quality of this rhythmic structure may be attributed to the tempo at which it is played.</p>



<p>After looking at the bass score, I realized that it consists of a two-quaver and one-crotchet rhythm. This raises the question of where the accent falls, whether it is on the first or the fifth beat. Based on the position of the break and the melodic leap, it appears that the accent may be on the fifth beat, although I may not be entirely right.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It has been widely accepted since Lenz&#8217;s 1852 Beethoven biography that his musical journey can be distinguished into&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It has been widely accepted since Lenz&#8217;s 1852 Beethoven biography that his musical journey can be distinguished into three distinct phases. In the first phase (1782-1802), he imitated Mozart and Haydn to fit the aesthetic of the time. The second phase (1803-1812) marked a period of stylistic evolution and the creation of his third to eighth symphonies. The third and final phase began around 1813 and involved experimentation with innovative sonorities. (Rogers, 1919).</p>



<p>The Pastoral Symphony, composed between 1807 and 1808, falls within the middle of Beethoven&#8217;s second phase, which was heavily influenced by the events explained in more detail <a href="./../../../research-point-5-0/index.html" data-type="post" data-id="1317">here</a>, such as artistic innovations, political revolutions, wars, but also personal struggles such as the onset of his deafness. </p>



<p>Premiered in Vienna, Austria, on December 22nd, 1808, during a concert at which several of his works were premiered, including his 5th Symphony, the Pastoral Symphony is written for a typical orchestra of that period: piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones, timpani and strings (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1998a). </p>



<p>Since they both premiered at the same concert and were composed at around the same time, the contrast between Symphony No. 5 and Symphony No. 6 is a remarkable aspect worth noting. No. 5 is vigorous and varied, while No. 6 is calm and pastoral, with programmatic titles illustrating rural life as a refuge. Was this contrast deliberate on Beethoven&#8217;s part? Why did he choose to compose a programmatic symphony? And why a pastoral theme?</p>



<p>In order to answer the last question, one must consider the intersection of his personal history and the historical context in which he was creating. On the personal side, according to Allen (2017), Beethoven had a profound love for nature and often sought refuge from the bustle of urban life by retreating to the countryside. But in a historical context, Will (1994:166) analyses, the pastoral theme was the most common subject in programmatic symphonies during the Classical Period, and Beethoven might have found inspiration in earlier works such as Justin Heinrich Knecht&#8217;s 1784 symphony &#8220;Le portrait musical de la nature,&#8221; which shares a similar programmatic intent with Beethoven&#8217;s 6th Symphony. However, in opposition to other programmatic symphonies, Beethoven intended this work to be “more the Expression of Feeling than Tone-Panting”.</p>



<p>The question of tone-painting in Beethoven&#8217;s Pastoral Symphony has sparked much debate and was subject to extensive criticism in two reviews in 1810, published in AMZ 12 and Zeitung für die elegante Welt 10. These reviews provide valuable insights into the contemporary perception of tone-painting. While initially denouncing it as &#8220;the utmost in tastelessness,&#8221; the AMZ review later justifies Beethoven&#8217;s use of tone-painting to represent emotions, rather than physical objects. The continues stating that theorists of expression saw superficiality as one of the greatest faults of tone-painting (Will, 1994:158-160).</p>



<p>The review published in Zeitung provides further insight into the perception of the Pastoral Symphony&#8217;s tone-painting. The reviewer acknowledges that the symphony portrays emotions associated with the pastoral but goes on to argue that it is more than a generic representation of such emotions. Rather, the scenes depicted are specific episodes from the composer&#8217;s own experiences in the countryside, imbued with his personal emotions. Consequently, the reviewer deems tone-painting to be of secondary importance, with the focus instead on the power of the composer&#8217;s personality (Will, 1994:161).</p>



<p>In my opinion, the reviews made a clear effort to dismiss tone-painting and focus on how Beethoven conveyed emotions (personal or generic) revealing that both this symphony and the cultural environment of its time were undergoing a discernible transition from the classicist period to the romantic era, exhibiting traits and preferences that spanned both styles. This is a reminder that such transitions are not time-bound but rather an organic and gradual process marked by overlaps. </p>



<p>Ultimately, this raises questions that remained unresolved in my research. Specifically, as Beethoven transitioned from the patronage system to a broader audience-based system, did he prioritize the opinions of critics with regard to tone-painting? Additionally, what was his stance regarding the proposition that tone-painting was a manifestation of tastelessness? Could this potentially explain why this is his only symphony?</p>



<h5 id="6th-symphony-movements" class="wp-block-heading">6th Symphony Movements</h5>



<p>Pastoral Symphony&#8217;s first movement, &#8220;Awakening of Cheerful Feelings upon Arrival in the Country,&#8221; serves as a joyful prelude. It features simple melodies and light rhythm, with homophonic orchestration and primarily major keys. Beethoven minimizes unexpected shifts by repeating motifs and only briefly uses a minor key.</p>



<p>The second movement, titled &#8220;Scene by the Brook,&#8221; is a serene and peaceful composition that is free of the typical Germanic tension often associated with Beethoven&#8217;s music. The movement begins with a lilting rhythmic motion that is said to sound like the flowing of a brook.</p>



<p>The third movement, titled &#8220;Merry Gathering of the Country Folk,&#8221; is a Scherzo in ABA form, with the main theme having a rustic feel. The trio section has a particularly country dance feel, with a constant emphasis on the downbeat of each bar. The movement ends with a curtailed return to the main theme, followed by a faster presto section and a transition into the next movement.</p>



<p>The fourth movement, entitled &#8220;Thunderstorm,&#8221; is a dramatic and tension-filled episode that deviates from the overall tranquil character of the symphony. The storm is portrayed through the depiction of thunder and thunderclaps, and the movement ultimately subsides, coinciding with the gradual fading of the storm.</p>



<p>Continuing without interruption, the fifth and final movement of the symphony is entitled &#8220;Shepherd&#8217;s Song, happy and thankful feelings after the storm.&#8221; It is a delightful and evocative music that utilizes a gentle and rhythmic theme that is repeated throughout the rondo form of the movement. The movement ends with a quiet and prayerful coda as if wishing farewell to the countryside before returning to the city.</p>

<p>The first movement of the composition is in the sonata form, as exemplified in Figure 1. The introduction starts with a theme, that can be considered the first theme of the first subject area. The initial four bars come to a halt by means of the fermata over a sustained C major chord, dominant of F major.</p>

<p>Within the initial 12 bars of the movement, Beethoven introduces the two principal themes that will serve as a significant guide throughout the piece, in addition to some hints of the motif&#8217;s development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1401" width="487" height="471" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24.png 974w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-300x290.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-768x743.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-640x619.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-26-at-21.31.24-960x928.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The first violins play a motific variation and the strings play the second theme of the first subject area at bars 8-12</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 16 comes an unexpected repetition on the strings. The first violins play the same rhythm as the second bar of the first theme, which lasts for 13 bars. The sole variation lies in the dynamics. This provides an indication of Beethoven&#8217;s approach to the symphony, characterized by repetitions, reutilization of motific material and a marked emphasis on dynamics.</p>

<p>At bar 29, the exposition section starts with a subdued presentation of the first theme initiated by the oboe, with the cellos and horns providing support. This theme is subsequently passed through the orchestra going through the clarinets and bassoons and finally with the strings. Notably, a sense of repetition is evident, as the same rhythm of the third bar of the first theme is repeated in the woodwinds and violins. However, the dynamics make all the difference in not making it seem stale.</p>

<p>At bar 46, Beethoven employs his first instance of tone-painting in the symphony, with the flutes performing a birdsong. This technique, however, is used sparingly throughout the first movement, with only one other occurrence observed during the recapitulation. This brings back the question of Beethoven&#8217;s intention with respect to tone painting. Was he conflicted between differing views on the technique, or was he experimenting with it in a playful or provocative manner, perhaps testing the reactions of audiences and critics?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1404" width="555" height="107" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05.png 740w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05-300x58.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.08.05-640x123.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Birdsong on the flutes at bars 46-48</figcaption></figure>



<p>Suddenly, at bar 53, a change in texture occurs as the clarinets and bassoons, followed by the horns, introduce a triplet theme, played over the rhythm of the first bar of the first theme. Once again, Beethoven employs repetition to great effect, inducing heightened tension as the triplet motif interrupts the expected continuation of the primary theme.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-1024x258.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1405" width="640" height="161" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-1024x258.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-300x76.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-768x194.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-640x161.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53-960x242.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-10.44.53.png 1364w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The horns play triples while the first violins play a variation of the first theme at bars 55-62</figcaption></figure>



<p>At bar 67, a traditional sonata change to the dominant key of C marks the beginning of the second subject area. The first theme is introduced by the first violin and subsequently transferred to all string instruments, followed by all woodwinds. Beethoven employs the same technique of repeating the theme, marked by a dynamic and instrumental buildup.</p>



<p>At bar 93, Beethoven introduces the second theme of the second subject area, which is characterized by a clear question-and-answer structure between the strings and woodwinds. The dynamics employed in this structure are noteworthy, as the question is played f while the answer is played p.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-1024x241.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1407" width="640" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-1024x241.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-300x71.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-768x181.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-640x151.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58-960x226.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-11.32.58.png 1375w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The oboe provides an answer to the first violins question at bars 93-99</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bar 111 marks the return of the triplets, providing a sense of a faster rhythm and subsequently leading to a prolonged repetition over a C pedal tone. The first two bars of the first theme of the first subject area are then repeated, which results in a substantial buildup of tension.</p>



<p>Based on my analysis, the development section starts at bar 151, marked by the modulation to Bb Major and the reappearance of the triplet rhythm, along with a slightly varied part of the second bar of the first theme of the first subject area. Notably, the development section is an unconventional deviation from the traditional expectation of dramatic and innovative contrast to the exposition. Instead, it features a static and repetitive section transposed into different keys. It actually reminded me of the Prelude in Wagner&#8217;s Das Rheingold, which builds in the intensity of dynamics and instrumentation while maintaining a constant motif.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-1024x631.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1409" width="512" height="316" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-1024x631.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-300x185.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-768x473.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-1536x946.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-640x394.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17-960x591.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-13.06.17.png 1734w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The strings repetition at bars 154-159</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bar 237 marks a key change to A Major where both the first and second themes from the first subject area make an appearance. The second theme is subsequently repeated, leading to a brief modulation to the minor key at bar 255, and finally to C Major at bar 263. While some might contend that the brief modulation to the minor key gives the development section the expected dramatism, it is, in fact, brief and it&#8217;s not repeated again.</p>



<p>At bar 282, the music reaches a moment of pause, with only the violin playing a trill, suggesting the arrival of the recapitulation and the return of the first theme. However, the second theme from the first subject area reappears, leaving the listener uncertain about whether the development section has ended. There&#8217;s a sense of false start, through persistent repetition that builds in dynamics, until the first theme from the first subject is ultimately played by all the instruments of the orchestra featured in the movement at bar 312, thereby indicating the start of the recapitulation.</p>



<p>The recapitulation goes back, as expected by classical sonata form, to both subject areas but in the tonic key of F Major. Notably, Beethoven chooses to initiate this section with a ff dynamic, rather than following the softer dynamic of the exposition, thereby contradicting the expectations. In the final stages of the recapitulation, the dynamics and texture gradually decrease, leading to a reduced level of tension as the music moves towards the coda.</p>



<p>The coda starts in bar 418 with a modulation to Bb Major, which I found unexpected. However, this modulation is brief, as it modulates back to F Major in measure 440. Beethoven utilizes dynamics that range from pp to ff, which creates a sense of uncertainty regarding the music&#8217;s conclusion, as he plays with the audience&#8217;s expectations. This leaves uncertainty about the end of the music until the orchestra ends playing.</p>



<p>After my research and analysis, my opinion is that Beethoven found himself composing this Symphony in times of change, where he was balancing his classical influences with a desire to establish himself as a disruptive composer and build the pavement for the romantic era. Beethoven&#8217;s use of traditional sonata form, such as the question/answer construction and the modulations in the development section, reflect his attachment to the classical principles of order and balance, while his exploration of static harmony for long periods and the repetition of a motif while exploring dynamics and timbres demonstrates his forward-thinking approach.</p>



<p>Additionally, Beethoven was also grappling with the concept of tone-painting and trying to appeal to a broader audience, which may have influenced his decision to use the natural world as a thematic focus in this symphony. Furthermore, the composer&#8217;s personal struggles with increasing deafness likely added a layer of complexity to his creative process and may have impacted his artistic choices in this work. </p>

<p>Although not typically drawn to classical guitar compositions, I discovered the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos&#8217; (1887-1957) 12 Études for Guitar and decided to listen to it.</p>



<p>Heitor Villa-Lobos is widely regarded as one of the foremost composers of Latin American music in the 20th century. His work is notable for its unique synthesis of Western classical music and traditional Brazilian folk songs and rhythms. Among his many notable works are the Etudes, composed in 1928 and dedicated to the renowned guitarist Andres Segovia. Alongside their didactic function, these pieces are often featured in live performances due to their musical richness and technical demands.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>A few of the études caught my attention.</p>



<p>Study No. 1, employs the technique of right-hand arpeggio. The formula is fixed, interrupted only in measures 23-24. The Study can be divided into three sections: the first section goes until measure 11, which is characterized by stability in the harmony. The second section runs from measure 12 to measure 22, where the arpeggios move down the scale by step, with a pedal E bass note. The third section covers measures 23 to 33, where the range of the notes is expanded. The study was symmetrically constructed with sections of 11 measures. The beauty of this piece lies in the cyclical repetition of each bar, which effectively generates a sense of tension and release.</p>



<p>Study No. 4 is centred on the continuous repetition of chords in the right hand while extensively exploring the harmonic capabilities of the guitar. I hear in these chords elements that anticipate the emergence of Brazilian popular music and bossa nova in the years following its composition.</p>



<p>Study No. 10 is characterized by a range of idiomatic resources and technical challenges, including the use of open strings as pedal notes and ornamental techniques for accompanying open strings. The first 20 bars of the piece are constructed around a fixed position of the left hand, which ascends chromatically, creating a sense of mounting tension. I believe this section showcases Villa-Lobos&#8217; skilful use of harmonic and melodic devices to create a dynamic and engaging piece of music.</p>

<p>Beethoven’s String Quartet Op. 18, No. 1 is the first of six quartets that were published together in 1801, known as the Op. 18 quartets. These quartets were written during Beethoven&#8217;s early period, and they represent a transition from the classical style of Haydn and Mozart to Beethoven&#8217;s unique and innovative approach to composition.</p>



<p>This is a composition that greatly impressed me due to its spirited and multifaceted character, full of energy, pathos, and even elements of humour, with abrupt pauses and deceptive endings. The first movement is marked by a playful and vigorous tone, gravitating around the opening motive and employing diverse variations of it throughout the piece. The second movement, by contrast, evokes a more serious and intense atmosphere, that some scholars suggest was inspired by the burial scene in Romeo and Juliet. The third movement, in turn, features a sprightly Scherzo and Trio. Finally, the Allegro finale provides an entertaining and engaging end to the composition, employing silence strategically to evoke a sense of surprise and delight among the audience.</p>



<p>The quartet features a balanced distribution of roles among the instruments. The first violin carries the primary melodic lines, while the other instruments have some supportive role, even though they play monophonically sometime. Indeed, a dynamic interplay exists among the instruments, with the primary melody traversing through all parts.</p>



<p>In my experience, some minor alterations were necessary when arranging a string quartet for solo piano, such as adjusting the harmonies to suit the pianists&#8217; hand limitations. However, the essential character of the quartet can still be captured by a piano, even though it can never catch the dynamic strength of four instruments. I think this is more noticeable in passages with sforzando, like the one in bar 22.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Beatles&#8217; &#8220;Here, There and Everywhere&#8221; is a lyrical and melodic love song, and according to Paul McCartney&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Beatles&#8217; &#8220;Here, There and Everywhere&#8221; is a lyrical and melodic love song, and according to Paul McCartney in the McCartney 1, 2, 3 documentary, it is his favourite melody he composed. Despite its compelling melody, it is strange, for me, that it&#8217;s not as well-known as other Beatles love songs such as &#8220;Something&#8221; or &#8220;And I Love Her.&#8221; Nevertheless, the explicit lyrics leave no room for doubt that the singer wants the lover to be present at all times and everywhere, which makes the theme of the song relatable and impactful.</p>



<p>The structure of the song is intriguing because there is ambiguity about which parts serve as the verse or chorus. There is no melodic and harmonic division that lets the listener distinguish which one serves as chorus or verse. Instead, it is easier to structure the song as Introduction &#8211; A &#8211; B &#8211; A &#8211; B &#8211; A.</p>



<p>Looking closer at the harmony, it is remarkable that the song has two modulations, which is uncommon in pop music, especially considering the song&#8217;s brief 2:24 minute runtime. The song is in the key of G major, and the first modulation happens in the A section, where the music shifts to the relative minor, E, with an F#m7 chord followed by a B major chord, and then moves to E minor chord shifting back to the key of G major.</p>



<p>The other modulation occurs in the B section, where the song modulates to Bb major. This is a relatively dramatic shift, but it is attenuated with preparation at the end of the A section, where the melody sings a Bb note before moving to the B section.</p>



<p>The melody is what I like the most about this music, especially the leap that first appears at bar 5. Upon closer inspection, this leap is similar to SZA&#8217;s &#8220;Kill Bill&#8221; melody (I wrote about it here), which employs an upward preparation followed by a descent with a longer duration. This is a good melodic technique that contributes to the song&#8217;s appeal.</p>

<p>The vocal harmonies in the song are simple and effective. According to the producer George Martin, &#8220;the boys&#8221; hummed basic triads behind the melody, resulting in moving block harmonies.</p>



<p>The song&#8217;s arrangement never seems to settle, similar to the Beach Boys&#8217; &#8220;God Only Knows,&#8221; which was, in fact, an inspiration for McCartney when he wrote, &#8220;Here, There and Everywhere.&#8221;</p>



<p>In conclusion, &#8220;Here, There and Everywhere&#8221;, for me, is a great example of a love song that demonstrates mastery of melody and harmony, but also simplicity. It is an excellent example of pop music that uses modulation effectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In Part 5 of this unit, we further explore our comprehension of the Classical Era by examining music on various levels that comprise it. Initially, we obtained a general understanding of the social, political, economic, and cultural circumstances of the era and the influence of significant historical events on this movement. This was a beneficial starting point in comprehending the background and customs of the Classical composers, as well as the innovations they introduced.</p>



<p>Regarding the music itself, the analysis process was usually very similar: listening to the piece following the score, adding annotations to key moments such as themes, sections and modulations, and passages of special textural and sonic interest.</p>



<p>During this particular part, the study of Sonata form held great significance as it allowed me to comprehend how a rigid structure could shape a musical piece or movement. Furthermore, it helped me understand how it offered the composers the flexibility to deviate from the established norms and infuse their own creativity. A prime example of this is Mozart&#8217;s Sonata No.15 in C major for Pianoforte, where he subtly alters the recapitulation by beginning it in the Dominant Key instead of the expected Tonic. Alternatively, some composers such as Bartók, choose to utilize only the fundamental elements of the Sonata form, as demonstrated in the example we analyzed.</p>



<p>Picking on this contrast between Mozart, Haydn and Bartók, I found also helpful to contrast compositions from different eras to identify their unique stylistic features and better appreciate their creative innovations. </p>



<p>Given that the Sonata form embodies the fundamental principles of classicism, emphasizing balance and elegance, it was expected to see that these composers followed these rigid structures. But analysis of the pieces brought to the surface how they crafted remarkable and captivating pieces that respected the structural conventions of the form they employed, while still managing to surprise and delight the listener.</p>



<p>One additional finding after going through different analyses of pieces of this era was that tonal relationships and thematic development were important features of classical works.</p>



<p>Personally, I find the process of &#8220;unpacking&#8221; a composition to be simultaneously fascinating and exhausting. On the one hand, it offers a privileged behind-the-scenes look at the composition, as if one were unravelling the very mind of the composer, as Cook (1987) aptly notes. On the other hand, this process can be time-consuming and arduous, in stark contrast to the simple act of listening to and experiencing a piece. It&#8217;s not uncommon to spend days analyzing a mere 20-minute composition, only to realize that there is still much left to uncover. Nonetheless, this meticulous approach often leads to a newfound appreciation and respect for a work that might have initially appeared less complex than it truly is.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Steve Reich (born October 3, 1936,&#160;New York, U.S.) is one of the greatest living composers. He is considered&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Steve Reich (born October 3, 1936,&nbsp;New York, U.S.)  is one of the greatest living composers. He is considered one of the greatest contributors to the minimalist music movement with a style based on repetitive and rhythmic patterns. His compositions often feature a limited number of instruments.</p>



<p>In 1988, Steve Reich created &#8220;Different Trains,&#8221; a three-part composition featuring a string quartet and excerpts from audio recordings. This highly personal work draws inspiration from Reich&#8217;s recollections of his Jewish upbringing in the United States and his train voyages across the country. The piece&#8217;s themes are further contextualized by the vastly different connotations associated with train travel during World War II in Europe, where the transportation of Jews took on an entirely different significance.</p>



<p>The pioneering aspect of the composition lies in its integration of prerecorded sounds with a live string quartet. Sourced from a range of records featuring diverse train sounds and spoken-word samples, including those from Holocaust survivors, this unique blend of live performance and recorded sounds lend a layer of profundity and authenticity to the piece. In particular, the first movement stands out for its complete fusion of the strings and recordings, with the latter serving as the motivic ideas that the strings then elaborate upon. This creative approach, innovative for its time, elevates &#8220;Different Trains&#8221; to a remarkable work of art.</p>



<p>Across all three movements, a continuous repetition of sounds and patterns interlock and build upon one another, creating a rich and almost hypnotic soundscape. While this reinforces the rhythmic motion of a train, it also enables the listener to become fully immersed in the 30-minute journey of an industrialized landscape, transitioning into haunting melodies and ultimately concluding on a hopeful note. </p>



<p>While I was unable to discern any conventional chord progressions commonly found in classical string quartets, I observed a pronounced typical rhythmic texture primarily conveyed through the strings. In my opinion, this rhythmic quality injects the composition with a sense of emotion, motion, and intrigue, preventing it from succumbing to monotony and repetitiveness.</p>



<p>In my view, the most fascinating aspect of &#8220;Different Trains&#8221; lies in its harmonious melding of realism and emotion. The inclusion of train whistles and station sounds fosters a vivid and evocative soundscape, while the voices infused throughout the piece infuse a human element that heightens the profound emotional depth already conveyed through the strings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cook (1987) raises a compelling argument regarding analysing music, which resonated with me in the few analysis I made during this course: how intimate you become with the music the more time you spend analysing it as if you&#8217;re unravelling the very mind of the composer. However, Cook also points out that to get that intimacy with the piece and closeness with the composer, one must know what questions to ask during an analysis. And here&#8217;s where analytical methods are important.</p>



<p>Musical analysis can cover a spectrum of considerations such as the social, historical and aesthetic factors and expressive content, as well as more formal analysis concerned to form, melodic, harmonic and rhythmic content.</p>



<p>One of the most recognized formal analyses was created by Heinrich Schenker in the years before the second world war and developed ever since. Cook refers to it as the &#8220;Schenkerian Analysis&#8221; that works very well with tonal music. Schenkerian theory proposes that music is made up of various layers: the ursatz or fundamental structure, which is a two-voice structure that forms the basis for an analytical approach to examine the complexities of a piece; the middle ground which consists of inter-relating the actual foreground of the music with the imaginary voices of the background (Cook, 1987); the foreground or surface level. </p>

The 123’s of Schenkerian Analysis</em> (no date). Available at: https://academic.udayton.edu/PhillipMagnuson/soundpatterns/perspec/123graphing.html.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another field of analysis is the semiotic one, which Jean-Jacques Nattiez is a proponent, does not concern itself with too much the diatonic framework, but rather with the repetition of units and analyzing how they used throughout the piece. </p>



<p>There is also the Set Theory, developed by Milton Babbitt and later Allen Forte. It can be used on any kind of music, including atonal music. Set theory primarily deals with pitch classes, which refer to the &#8220;character&#8221; of a pitch. This analytical approach that allows for the description of all pitch and interval class collections, without relying on the traditional triadic or tonal functions. The result is a reduction in the total number of sets, making the process more manageable and accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This String Quartet got my attention right at the beginning. The opening is a slow and haunting Adagio introduction, which features discordant harmonies that create a sense of tension and unease. The pulsating cello descends chromatically leaving a harmonic ambiguity that surprised me. I wasn&#8217;t expecting this kind of introduction by Mozart. The other strings keep playing colliding notes, while the dynamics keep going from p to f and back to p. These 22 bars of the Adagio create a stark contrast with the subsequent Allegro movement, which is characterized by its lively and playful nature.</p>



<p>This string quartet in C major was composed in 1785 and is part of the set of six quartets composed between 1782 and 1785 that he dedicated to Joseph Haydn. This introduction was so innovative and disruptive for its time that it received mixed reviews from critics, publishers and players.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A string quartet is generally composed of two violins, a viola and one cello and is typically viewed&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A string quartet is generally composed of two violins, a viola and one cello and is typically viewed as a genre of music that is like a conversation. In fact, in a letter from 1829, addressed to the composer Carl Friedrich Zelter, Goethe compared the string quartet to &#8220;a stimulating conversation between four intelligent people&#8221; and saw in it &#8220;the most comprehensible of instrumental music genres.&#8221; </p>



<p>The evolution of the string quartet is not entirely clear, although there seems to be an inclination towards the divertimento genre and the Baroque Trio Sonata as possible sources of influence. What is clear is that the string quartet grew in popularity due to its low cost and ease of rehearsal. It was also the ideal size for small home gatherings and allowed for more freedom in composing. In addition to its practicality, the string quartet is also thought to have reflected the aesthetic values of the Enlightenment era: its intimate conversation with equal participation of all voices, as well as its capacity to convey a deep musical thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although other composers such as Holzbauer, Wagenseil, Allegri, and Scarlatti had explored the string quartet, it is Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) who is widely regarded as &#8220;the father of the string quartet.&#8221; While he did not invent the genre, he made the most significant contributions to defining it, composing a total of 68 quartets. Initially, the quartets he wrote were primarily centred on the first violin, with the viola and cello doubling the melody. However, over time, he evolved the texture to be more uniform in terms of the instruments&#8217; importance. Furthermore, he also refined the form, initially starting with five movements, like the divertimento genre, but later settling on four movements, with the first one in sonata form.</p>



<p>Mozart was another influential composer who helped develop the string quartet, notably with the six pieces dedicated to Haydn and the three dedicated to Frederick William II of Prussia. These quartets are regarded as mature works and reflect the style established by Haydn.</p>



<p>Beethoven was influenced by the work of Haydn and Mozart. While his first six quartets, Op.18 (1798–1800), adhered to the established string quartet framework, his three Razumovsky quartets, Opus 59 (1806), are regarded as reflecting his transition towards Romanticism and are widely considered to be among his finest works.</p>



<p>In the 19th century, some composers moved away from classical forms, like Liszt, Wagner, and Richard Strauss, resulting in a decrease in quartet composition. However, Antonín Dvořák wrote 14 quartets. The quartet regained popularity among composers during the Modern era, playing a key role in the works of Debussy, Ravel, Schoenberg, Bartók, and Shostakovich. In the late 20th century the genre still has some composers interested in developing it, such as Karlheinz Stockhausen&#8217;s Helikopter-Quartett composed in 1992-93. Composers such as Riley, Glass, Reich and John Adams produced string quartets in their own style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The texture of the main theme can be seen as a four-part counterpoint as each instrument has its own independent line. However, when listening to this section, one perceives a distinct melody on the first violin supported by the accompaniment, especially in the viola and the cello.</p>



<p>In the first variation, the second violin plays the melody while the first violin plays an arpeggiated figure. I&#8217;m not sure if this is considered a two-part counterpoint because there is no distinct melody on the first violin. Nonetheless, the first violin&#8217;s role feels more like an accompaniment. Upon listening to this variation, one can perceive that both instruments are connected, especially in bar 36 when both instruments reach their climax at the same time.</p>

<p>The second variation has a richer texture. The cello takes on the primary melody, while the second violin initially moves homophonically with the cello before gradually diverging and converging with the first violin. The first violin features a distinct melody that starts out thin and gradually becomes denser as the variation progresses. Meanwhile, The viola has a simple accompaniment part. This variation can be seen as a three-part counterpoint.</p>



<p>The third variation presents a more intricate texture and a chromatic sound. The viola takes on the primary melody, while the two violins play their own distinct melodies. The cello remains silent for eight bars, but upon entering, it creates an intensely chromatic feeling in bars 69-71, perhaps due to its bass sound serving as the foundation for the chords. This variation appears to have a four-part counterpoint, featuring highly independent lines. However, there are moments where the voices seem to be rhythmically coordinated.</p>

<p>The final variation returns to the simplicity of the first variations. The main melody is played by the first violin, and the other voices serve to support it while retaining their unique character. It may not necessarily qualify as a definitive four-part counterpoint. The texture is much more compact compared to the previous variation, and it becomes particularly crisp in bars 91-97, where all instruments play in their upper register.</p>

<p>The main difference between the first and second movements is that in the latter the texture shifts from one variation to the next, but remains constant within each individual variation. In the first movement, the texture continuously changes without a discernible pattern or structure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I find investigations such as the one conducted on Haydn&#8217;s Emperor to be extremely useful, particularly when seeking to bridge the gap between the emotional and rational aspects of classical music. When casually listening to a piece, we can often become consumed by the emotions it evokes, without giving much thought to how they are conveyed. However, investigating the structure and development of a composition, as well as the techniques used by the composer, provides us with a more rational understanding of the music. Through investigation, we can better appreciate the intricate and intentional ways in which the music is made to bring out specific emotional responses and enhance our overall listening experience.</p>



<p>Through this investigation, I gained a deeper understanding of the Sonata form and how it can be developed with different themes. I also gained a new understanding of the techniques used by composers to create a musical journey that navigates from the home key to a distant key and back again. This exploration reminded me that musical forms are not rigid structures, but rather malleable frameworks that composers can use as they see fit, much like Bartók did.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I found the investigative approach to be extremely useful, as it provided me with a structured framework for future analysis. Starting with a broad perspective and progressively digging into specific details:</p>



<ul>
<li>Identify the form</li>



<li>Identify themes and keys</li>



<li>Outline the structure</li>



<li>Establish how the transitions of keys and sections are made</li>



<li>Analyse how themes are built and used throughout the piece</li>
</ul>



<p>One thing that is missing from this analysis is to consider the broader musical landscape at the time of composition, such as the prevailing trends and techniques used by other composers. By understanding the broader musical context, we can better appreciate what makes a piece unique and significant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The piece begins in C major and the first four bars present the themes and are very homogenous in terms of rhythm between the instruments. This and the perfect cadences convey a sense of comfort and stability</p>



<p>The key continues to be C major until bar 13, where the first theme modulates. This brings a confusing mood to the piece, where the centre of tonality seems to be lost. I get the sense that it moves to E, before having the pedal note in D. This pedal tone creates a lot of tension, before establishing the new key.</p>



<p>In the second subject area, the piece moves to the secondary dominant key of G. This feels fresh but still in a bright mood. However, the piece momentarily shifts to G minor at bar 29, creating an edgy and uncertain mood. Overall, this section has a sense of stability but provides unexpected twists and turns, keeping the listener engaged.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Béla Bartók (1881 &#8211; 1945) was a Hungarian composer, and one of the most influential figures in 20th-century&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Béla Bartók (1881 &#8211; 1945) was a Hungarian composer, and one of the most influential figures in 20th-century music. His pieces are known for their extensive chromaticism and novel rhythms. He is known for collecting and studying authentic Hungarian folk music and incorporating them into his music. He wrote six string quartets which were among his most impressive achievements, being the fourth, the most celebrated.</p>



<p>The String Quartet No.4 has five movements that are written symmetrically. It contains two sets of identical movements with a middle movement which is the central point of the quartet. Here is Bartók explaining it:</p>



<p>&#8220;The work is in five movements; their character corresponds to Classical sonata form. The slow movement is the kernel of the work; the other movements are, as it were, arranged in layers around it. Movement IV is a free variation of II, and I and V have the same thematic material; that is, around the kernel (Movement III), metaphorically speaking, I and V are the outer, II and IV the inner layers.&#8221; (Keller, 2011).</p>



<p>Although Bartók suggests that the nature of the first and final movements corresponds with that of the Classical sonata form, I believe that he merely employed the concept of the sonata form and utilized it liberally as a framework for his composition, without adhering rigorously to its conventions. Distinct motifs are present in the quartet, rather than explicitly articulated themes as found in the sonatas of Beethoven or Haydn. These motific ideas tend to appear for a very short time and disappear quickly. This reminds me of Debussy.</p>



<p>Upon listening to this piece for the first time, I found it much harder to distinguish the sonata sections, in contrast to Haydn&#8217;s quartet, wherein such segments were easily discernible. However, after reading the score and watching Andreyev&#8217;s analysis, I was able to understand the structure of the piece, the division of the sections, and the appearance of each motif.<br></p>



<p>When listening to the entire movement, I found it to be incredibly radical and challenging to follow. This left me confused, especially knowing that Bartók employs several counterpoint techniques that are commonly used in the works of many Western composers, including contrary motion, imitation, inversions, and call-and-response.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="297" height="300" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-24-at-16.44.35-297x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1346" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-24-at-16.44.35-297x300.png 297w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-24-at-16.44.35-80x80.png 80w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-24-at-16.44.35-300x303.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-24-at-16.44.35-640x647.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-24-at-16.44.35.png 702w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Inversion</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bartók demonstrates an innovative use of the quartet by investigating the sonorities of the three instruments through techniques such as extreme note ranges, varied glissandos, and his unique interpretation of pizzicato, which involves a vigorous plucking motion that produces a sharp snap upon the string&#8217;s impact with the instrument.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>All art evolves in a cultural, social, and political context and music is no exception. The birth of the Classicism in the 18th Century can be traced to the following phenomena: Enlightenment, democratization, humanism, the emergence of the middle class and the development of new musical styles and instruments.</p>



<p>The Enlightenment  (1685 – 1815) was a transformative era in history that rejected traditional ideas of the time and emphasized the importance of reason and logic. It advocated for a rational, scientific approach to life in contrast to superstition and traditionalism. As critical thinking gained traction, it posed a challenge to the established church and organized religion.</p>



<p>During this period, political upheavals and conflicts were prevalent. The American and French Revolutions, the War of the Austrian Succession, and the Seven Years&#8217; War, among others, played a significant role in shaping the ideals of the epoch, highlighting the significance of equal rights. It led to a steep rising in democratization.</p>



<p>Economically, land was no longer the only source of income. With the advent of manufacturing and trading, job opportunities and skills emerged. Individuals were no longer defined solely by their family background, but by their professions. This transformation led to the emergence of the middle class, which in turn put pressure on society to change institutions and improve their standard of living, income, and social mobility.</p>



<p>In terms of intellectual evolution, humanistic ideas regained their prominence and a newfound belief that life on earth is as important as life after death challenged the church&#8217;s traditional stance. Prominent French intellectuals such as Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau spoke out against outdated concepts of aristocracy, class divisions, and religious and racial prejudices.</p>



<p>During this time, society began to view science and art as complementary rather than opposing forces. There was an increase in the importance of creating harmony and harmony in all aspects of life. The Encyclopaedia of Diderot d’Alembert was a great example of this cross-disciplinary collaboration, as it aimed to gather knowledge from all different areas, including music.</p>



<p>All this led to profound changes in music. </p>



<p>Music was previously only available to the elite, but The Enlightenment changed how music was written and distributed. The music industry became more profitable, and composers were able to earn a living for themselves. Music was democratized, and composers began writing more freely for public concerts pursuing a greater emphasis on the structure of the piece and creating simpler harmonic functions. This led to a departure from the elaborate ornamentation of the Baroque music era.</p>



<p>Musical tastes of the middle-class criteria favoured tuneful, clear and homophonic sounds. The piano, invented in the late Baroque, was capable of greater dynamic sensitivity. Similarly, the violin underwent significant technical changes, resulting in increased range and sound projection. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Programme notes</strong></p>



<p>The beauty of twilight time, between sunset and moonrise, has captivated human beings for centuries. The Latins had an expression for this special time of day &#8211; &#8220;lux quae fugit,&#8221; which translates to &#8220;the light that flees.&#8221; This phrase captures the ephemeral and fleeting nature of twilight, which often invokes a mixture of feelings. Some may feel nostalgic for the day that is ending while others may feel peaceful for the night to start. Despite the tumultuous emotions that arise, the eventual arrival of night inevitably brings a sense of calm and tranquillity.</p>



<p><strong>Composition</strong></p>



<p>My composition takes inspiration from Impressionist music, particularly Debussy&#8217;s preludes. The piece is structured into three distinct parts: the relaxing day, the tumultuous feelings of twilight, and the peace of the night.</p>



<p>To achieve an Impressionistic sound, I started by experimenting with various pentatonic scales on the piano, ultimately settling on the arpeggio of the C# minor pentatonic. This scale forms the basis for the first part of the prelude, with modulations to C# Dorian  (bars 5-6) and A Dorian (bars 7-8).</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a brief transition where I actually don&#8217;t know which C major mode I wrote, but I believe it sounds like a D Dorian until it settles in a C Mixolydian.</p>



<p>The middle section of the piece is marked by a play between C Mixolydian and a Whole Tone scale, with a brief detour into the Whole Tone scale based on Eb (bars 18-19). This leads into the &#8220;cascading&#8221; section, where the music moves from the C Mixolydian to the G major modes of A Dorian and B Phrygian, ending in E harmonic minor. This section aims to explore the extremes of the piano, creating a mysterious feeling of going up and down simultaneously.</p>



<p>The final section of the prelude moves from D Major to G Major and ends in C Major, evoking a sense of peace and tranquillity after the tumultuous emotions of twilight.</p>



<p>Throughout the piece, I utilize a pedal tone to build tension and create a sense of stationary motion.</p>



<p>Overall, my goal in this composition was to capture the essence of Impressionist music by exploring unique scales and timbres on the piano while conveying the range of emotions experienced during the transition from day to night.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Alban Berg (1885-1935), along with Anton Webern (1883–1945), were two of the three composers of the Second Viennese&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alban Berg (1885-1935), along with Anton Webern (1883–1945), were two of the three composers of the Second Viennese School which Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) pioneered. </p>



<p>Alban Berg, an Austrian composer born in Vienna, started his music education with Arnold Schoenberg in 1904. He was active during the remarkable artistic, musical, and literary upsurge in Vienna during the early 20th century, associating with prominent figures such as Gustav Klimt. Berg&#8217;s work is often viewed as more melodious and comprehensible than that of his mentor, Schoenberg. His most renowned compositions encompass a variety of musical forms, including orchestral music, such as Five Orchestral Songs (1912), chamber music, songs, and two pioneering operas, Wozzeck (1925) and Lulu (1937). The Violin Concerto, which Berg composed in 1935, is widely regarded as his masterpiece.</p>



<p>This piece was dedicated to Manon Gropius, the daughter of Alma Mahler and Walter Gropius, who died of polio at the age of eighteen. Berg crafted this piece in two movements, each of which comprised two distinct parts. The first movement adheres to the conventional sonata form, commencing with an Andante section and culminating with an Allegretto segment evocative of dance. This movement is deemed to symbolize life. The second movement primarily revolves around a recurring rhythmic cell (Allegro), which is succeeded by a sombre Adagio portion, portraying death.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="238" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bergs_tone_row_600px.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-1286" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bergs_tone_row_600px.jpeg 600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bergs_tone_row_600px-300x119.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Berg&#8217;s use of the twelve-tone row in the composition is considerably rooted in conventional harmony. This is due to the fact that the twelve-tone row can be divided into three triad chords, succeeded by notes of the whole tone scale that lead up to G. Alternatively, the tone row can be analyzed as G minor major 7, A minor major 7, followed by the notes of the whole tone scale.</p>



<p>Upon listening to the piece and studying the score, it appears that Berg&#8217;s selection of the tone row effectively established tonality into an essentially atonal framework. I believe that this decision contributed to the composers&#8217; capacity to pay tribute to Manon Gropius.</p>



<p>Ultimately, despite the rigorously technical structure, the composition evokes strong emotional sentiments and conveys profound expressivity.</p>



<p>Anton Webern, a notable composer and conductor, was also born in Vienna. In 1904 he started receiving composition lessons from Arnold Schoenberg. Webern is considered as one of the foremost proponents of the twelve-tone technique and is renowned for pushing it to its limits. Despite producing some orchestral works, his work primarily comprises vocal and instrumental chamber music, with only a single symphonic composition.</p>



<p>His compositional style is distinguished by its succinctness, brevity, and intensity. The composer undertook an exploration of innovative dimensions of musical expression, particularly atonality, while simultaneously exhibiting meticulous attention to detail, and at times, an exacting rigidity in his musical compositions. He was very fond of utilizing classical forms as a foundational framework upon which to construct his twelve-tone music. I believe that his compositional style is particularly evident in Symphony, Op.21.</p>



<p>In contrast to Berg&#8217;s concerto, Webern&#8217;s Symphony highlights a more radical utilization of the twelve-tone methodology. The use of canons in the first movement and the theme and variations in the second movement are a more methodical use for the twelve-tone. Despite the presence of classical forms in this composition, its analysis presents considerable challenges to me. The melody line, shaped by the canons and their inversions, rapidly transitions between different instruments, reflecting a distinctive style of Webern&#8217;s compositional style.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="721" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-10-at-10.52.13-1024x721.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1289" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-10-at-10.52.13-1024x721.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-10-at-10.52.13-300x211.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-10-at-10.52.13-768x541.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-10-at-10.52.13-1536x1081.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-10-at-10.52.13-2048x1442.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-10-at-10.52.13-640x451.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-10-at-10.52.13-960x676.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-10-at-10.52.13.png 2338w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mario Yesyes (2022) <em>Webern symphony op. 21: 4-part double canon with colours and tone-rows analysed</em>. Available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PDcD3PoYA4.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Webern&#8217;s implementation of the twelve-tone row methodology is characterized by a pronounced mathematical orientation, contrasting with Berg&#8217;s harmonic approach. The composer utilized a symmetrical row structure that may be divided into two parts, with the second part representing a retrograde of the first. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the interval between the first and twelfth, second and eleventh, and so forth, is always a tritone. This row exemplifies Webern&#8217;s preference for the utilization of half-steps in his compositions.</p>

<p>After listening to it several times, I feel that the composition is distinguished by its minimalistic character and sparse texture. Despite the limited instrumentation, the piece is remarkable for its extraordinary intensity. The attention to detail is evident in the nuanced interplay of instruments, where each contributes to a great variety of colour and texture, creating a dense and complex web of sounds that together form a cohesive whole.</p>

<p>I decided to listen to Devonté Hynes&#8217; music after reading a review in the Guardian of his concert with the London Symphony Orchestra. I didn&#8217;t know his work, so it was interesting to dig a bit into his work. </p>



<p>Devonté Hynes&#8217; Long Ride II is a two-piano rendition that was written for HBO&#8217;s Series “We Are Who We Are.” Hynes is primarily known for his R&amp;B and indie music, but he has recently been exploring classical music, which I find an interesting move. </p>



<p>The Long Ride II features a repetitive arpeggio and chords in one of the pianos, while the other builds upon the background, almost as if it is improvising. It has an impressionist feeling of improvisation, and perhaps in the live version, the pianist is really improvising.</p>



<p>The piece is based on an F major chord, and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a defined structure. Instead, there is an increase in texture that keeps growing until almost the finale where one of the pianos plays alone, which is like a return to the beginning.</p>



<p>Although Devonté Hynes&#8217; Long Ride II is an intriguing piece of music that highlights his exploration of classical music, I personally don&#8217;t find its repetitive nature appealing. However, I believe that delving deeper into the music can reveal the specific elements of change or lack thereof that either draw us in or push us away. While there are examples of repetitive music that do appeal to me (such as compositions by Steve Reich, for instance), it seems that in the case of Long Ride II, there may be either insufficient or excessive variation that prevents it from capturing my interest. Nonetheless, I still believe it was worth giving it a listen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite being perceived as holding irreconcilable positions by their contemporaries, it is now widely understood that the apparent conflict between Schoenberg and Stravinsky was largely manufactured by political propagandists. Contemporary views acknowledge that both artists shared similar aims and objectives.</p>



<p>During the interwar period, the Romantic era approached a state of near-collapse, as evidenced by the prevalence of monumental symphonic works and autobiographical tone poems. This led to a conscious rejection of the whole apparatus of late Romantic music and a call for a simpler, more objective music. They felt the need to go back in time, a nostalgia, for inspiration and perhaps a homage to previous composers such as Mozart, Bach or Beethoven, in order to bring some clarity and order to music. </p>



<p>Various artists had differing perspectives on the interpretation of &#8220;order&#8221;. Notably, serialists, particularly Schoenberg, regarded the notion of order as a strict construct, almost akin to the concept of law. In fact, Josef Matthias Hauer presented his &#8220;law of the twelve tones&#8221; in 1919.</p>



<p>In contrast, there were a group of artists who believed that this order should be less strict and more based on musical forms and stylistic features from previous eras, such as the Classical Period. This led to Neoclassicism.</p>



<p>Neoclassicism involved a rejection of the lush harmonies and exaggerated emotionalism of late Romanticism, as well as a rejection of modernism&#8217;s atonal and experimental tendencies. Instead, neoclassical composers sought to create clear, concise, and intellectually rigorous works using classical forms and structures such as the sonata, concerto, and symphony.</p>



<p>Although Prokofiev&#8217;s Classical Symphony (1918) may seem to be the first neoclassical work, the start of the movement is generally attributed to Igor Stravisnky&#8217;s Pulcinella (1919), a ballet using themes by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and other baroque composers. Stravinsky continued to explore neoclassical ideas in works such as the &#8220;Octet for Wind Instruments&#8221; (1923), the &#8220;Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments&#8221; (1924), and the &#8220;Symphony of Psalms&#8221; (1930). In these works, Stravinsky used classical forms and structures but also incorporated elements of modernism, such as dissonant harmonies and polyrhythms.</p>



<p>One of the most important Neoclassical artists was Paul Hindemith who systematically developed a new contrapuntal style, described as a 20th-century version of Bach.</p>



<p>Some other important composers that have written in neoclassical style are Satie, Bartók, Milhaud, de Falla or Tailleferre. </p>



<p>Given the considerable experimentation and creative exploration present in various musical styles in the early twentieth century, it is understandable why some regarded neoclassicism as a musical step backwards, a regression through past musical history. But as serialism, it is clear now that neoclassicism has become recognized as an important movement that synthesized new and old musical ideas and created a unique aesthetic that continues to inspire contemporary composers.</p>

<p>Gamelan music, originating from Java in Indonesia, features an ensemble of tuned metal instruments, including gongs and percussion instruments. This type of music is also found throughout Southeast Asia. The sound of gamelan music is characterized by an interplay of metallic sounds defined by one of two scales: slendro, which divides the octave into five equal intervals, and pelog, which divides it into seven.</p>



<p>Balinese music is structured like a tree, with different instruments symbolizing the trunk, branches, and flowers. The core melody, or pokok, is played by one group of instruments in one octave. Another group stresses this melody at regular intervals, while a third expands it into a full melody with a range of two to three octaves. A fourth group doubles and paraphrases it an octave higher, while a fifth group plays an ornamental figuration. Gongs punctuate and structure the music, while the drums provide rhythmic support.</p>



<p>Upon listening to gamelan music, one is struck by the clear and metallic sounds, which evoke the stirring of a thousand bells. The interplay of the sounds is delicate and complex and possesses a sensuous charm. The overall effect is one of mystery, which can be quite overpowering.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The impact of Claude Debussy&#8217;s musical vocabulary on the evolution of jazz has been profound (Pamies, 2021), influencing&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The impact of Claude Debussy&#8217;s musical vocabulary on the evolution of jazz has been profound (Pamies, 2021), influencing a number of composers such as Duke Ellington, one of the founding fathers of jazz. (Ross, 2018).</p>



<p>To gain a complete appreciation of the compositional styles of Claude Debussy and Miles Davis, it is crucial to grasp the underlying motivations that propelled their groundbreaking musical achievements. Both artists tried to distance themselves from the prevailing artistic currents of their era. Debussy aimed to liberate himself from the influence of Germanic Romanticism, while Davis aspired to transcend the weighty tonality and fast harmonic rhythms of bebop jazz. In essence, both composers yearned to liberate themselves from the confines of their respective musical traditions and push the limits of harmonic and melodic freedom to new frontiers.</p>



<p>To achieve their respective goals, Debussy adopted an Impressionist style of music, while Davis found inspiration in modal jazz.</p>



<p>The 1959 release of Miles Davis&#8217; album, &#8220;Kind of Blue,&#8221; marked a pivotal moment in the history of jazz, especially the inaugural track of the album, &#8220;So What,&#8221; which is famous for being one of the first modal jazz songs.</p>



<p>Waters (2005) argues that there exist four salient techniques that typify modal jazz, namely the utilization of extended pedal points, suppression of standard harmonic progressions, slow harmonic rhythm, and association of a seven-note scalar collection with each harmony. The presence of these characteristics in the music of Debussy is a compelling evidence of his influence on jazz.</p>

<p>Besides the direct reference in the introduction to Debussy&#8217;s Voiles, both styles share a preoccupation with harmony and colour, and they tend to focus on creating a mood or atmosphere rather than following a rigid melodic or harmonic structure. Debussy’s use of whole-tone and pentatonic scales and unconventional chord progressions echo the modal jazz style that Davis developed in “So What.”</p>



<p>Regarding dissonance, one of Debussy&#8217;s biggest influences in this track in particular and in Jazz, in general, is the idea of “free dissonance”. The thinking that the 7th or 9th of a chord can exist as a sonority on its own without the need for resolution into a consonance. </p>



<p>Additionally, &#8220;So What&#8221; reflects another significant feature of Debussy&#8217;s style: improvisational feeling. Focusing on the use of a single mode or scale over extended periods and placing equal harmonic weight on all notes associated with a particular chord, resulted in a heightened sense of liberation in both melodic and harmonic exploration, ultimately fostering a greater degree of creative freedom for improvisation and experimentation. This approach influenced the genre and ultimately led to the development of Free Jazz.</p>



<p>Overall, it can be argued that Debussy&#8217;s influence on Miles Davis and Bill Evans can be summed up as promoting harmonic and melodic freedom, with a focus on colour, imagination, and sound.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 1781, Franz Joseph Haydn composed his Op. 33 String Quartets, which he dedicated to the Grand Duke Paul of Russia. Consequently, these quartets are frequently referred to as the &#8220;Russian&#8221; quartets. The second quartet in E-flat, commonly known as the &#8220;Joke&#8221; quartet, is the most celebrated of the set. The nickname &#8220;Joke&#8221; is believed to have originated from the final movement, which incorporates a series of playful musical jokes, such as a mock conclusion and an unexpected outburst of powerful chords, which leave the listener with a feeling of joyful surprise.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="716" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-716x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1302" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-716x1024.png 716w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-210x300.png 210w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-300x429.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-640x915.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40.png 747w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" /></figure>



<p>Comprising four movements, the piece follows a a non-traditional structure. The first movement is composed in Sonata form, while the second, instead of being a Minuet and Trio, is a Scherzo and Trio. The third and fourth movements are both arranged as a Rondo.</p>



<p>The quartet opens with a delightful theme that is subsequently fragmented, manipulated, and reassembled in various ways. Personally, I found this movement to be lighthearted and fascinating, particularly as Haydn deftly plays with the theme, departing from and returning to it, as demonstrated in the following example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="713" height="517" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.43.45.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1303" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.43.45.png 713w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.43.45-300x218.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.43.45-640x464.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></figure>



<p>The second movement caught my attention with the violin slides present in the Trio section. The movement has a dance-like quality to it, with the second violin intermittently interacting with the first violin. At the same time, the viola and cello provide a steady foundation for the piece.</p>



<p>The third movement presents a stark contrast, opening with the lower strings and at a slower tempo in a Largo style. I found the movement to be somewhat dramatic, particularly with the powerful forte chords played by all strings. An illustration of this effect is evident in the following example towards the end of the movement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="453" height="295" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.57.43.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1307" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.57.43.png 453w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.57.43-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></figure>



<p>The Rondo in the fourth movement shows a catchy, memorable theme that is both danceable and owns a humorous character. The coda segment of the movement is surprising, as the expected recurrence of the theme is subject to hesitant pauses, creating a sense of suspense and uncertainty for the listener. The final pause builds a sense of anticipation, ultimately ending with a soft whisper that leaves the listener with an unresolved sense of closure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Voiles,&#8221; meaning &#8220;sails&#8221; or &#8220;veils,&#8221; gave me the impression of a connection to the wind. As I listened to it, the gentle, ethereal quality of the music immediately brought to mind the iconic Plastic Bag scene from the film &#8220;American Beauty.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="AMERICAN BEAUTY ~ Plastic Bag Scene [HD]" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qssvnjj5Moo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>After re-watching the scene, I believe the composer, Thomas Newman, was inspired by Debussy&#8217;s &#8220;Voiles&#8221;. There are similarities between the two pieces: both feature motifs that move in parallel chords, with an unresolved melodicism and a persistent pedal point running throughout.</p>



<p>While &#8220;Voiles&#8221; evokes a sense of wind, it also carries a certain air of mystery, which can be attributed to the concept of veils. The pervasive use of the whole-tone scale throughout the piece may contribute to this enigmatic quality, adding to the overall impression of ambiguity and uncertainty.</p>



<p>In the opening of the prelude, Debussy builds a small melodic motif around a whole-tone scale harmonized by intervals of a 3rd and 4th, with the pedal note B-flat providing a sense of grounding that will persist throughout almost every bar of the piece. In a way, it seems as though the piece doesn&#8217;t really go anywhere &#8211; it lacks a clear direction or purpose, much like a veil (or a plastic bag) caught in the wind. It simply floats and drifts, carried along by the shifting currents of the melody.</p>

<p>Debussy repeats and develops the initial motif throughout the piece until he eventually suspends the pedal and introduces a new melodic element &#8211; a minor pentatonic scale in E-flat &#8211; as a response and a closing of the development. This section feels like a release from the constraint of the previous material and is perhaps the most exciting part of the piece. However, it doesn&#8217;t last long, and soon the melody returns to its drifting, aimless quality, leaving the listener with a sense of unresolved tension and mystery.</p>



<p>The main whole-tone section returns after just a few bars, and with it comes the sensation of floating, only now with some runs that add a bit of movement to the melody. There&#8217;s a sense that the piece is building towards a climax, with a cadence perhaps just around the corner &#8211; but it never arrives. The floating feeling persists all the way to the end, leaving the listener with a sense of lingering uncertainty and an unfulfilled sense of resolution.</p>



<p>Especially in the first few pages of the score, I can sense a clear counterpoint between the voices, such as the use of contrary motion in this example, as well as a sense of distinct rhythms between them.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The history of the modes goes back to ancient Greece when they used different scale systems to divide&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The history of the modes goes back to ancient Greece when they used different scale systems to divide the octave and named them after territories of Greece and around. The Christian church, around 750 AD, developed seven different scale patterns called Gregorian chant, and gave them the names of the Greek modes, without worrying about their similarities. By 1700, most music used only two of the seven modes, which became known as the major and minor keys. In modern music, modes are less commonly used than major or minor keys, but they can also be found in folk, jazz, classical, and pop music (Powell, 2011).</p>



<p>The seven Greek modes are:</p>



<ol>
<li>Ionian (also known as the major scale)</li>



<li>Dorian</li>



<li>Phrygian</li>



<li>Lydian</li>



<li>Mixolydian</li>



<li>Aeolian (also known as the natural minor scale)</li>



<li>Locrian</li>
</ol>



<p>Each mode consists of a set pattern of tones and semitones derived from the W-W-H-W-W-W-H pattern from the major scale as we can see from the example below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="803" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-803x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1259" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-803x1024.png 803w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-235x300.png 235w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-768x980.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-300x383.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-640x817.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-960x1225.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57.png 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The seven European heptatonic diatonic &#8220;church&#8221; modes (Tagg,2014)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The most interesting aspect to me is understanding why should a composer use such modes. The straight answer is to give the composer more emotional options than the standard major and minor dichotomy. With modes, is as if the composer is able to introduce, even briefly, a new colour or flavour to convey a specific mood or emotion.</p>



<p>I found Tagg&#8217;s (2014) explanation of which traits each mode has, very helpful.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ionian</strong>: is the most common mode in western music and its intervals are the most comfortable to the regular western listener. Music in Ionian mode tends to be happy and bright with examples such as national anthems (God Save The Queen, The Star-Spangled Banner), Happy Birthday or Jingle Bells.</li>



<li><strong>Dorian</strong>: after the Ionian and Aeolian, this is the most common mode mostly because of its similarity with the natural minor (except for the raised sixth in Dorian). Its distinctiveness comes from the combination of minor 3rd and 7th and major 6th. In order to sound Dorian, one must use the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 6th which lends the music a melancholic yet optimistic sound.</li>



<li><strong>Phrygian: </strong>this is the only mode that has a minor 2nd and a perfect 5th and it&#8217;s commonly used in Flamenco. Being a minor mode, it has a darker feel than the Aeolian because of the minor 2nd and has been used by the heavy metal genre to convey a mysterious and &#8220;doom&#8221; feeling, such as in Wherever I May Roam by Metallica.</li>



<li><strong>Lydian:</strong> this mode is just like Ionian but it has a raised 4th which lends the scale an airy, floating and happier sound than Ionian. Film composers tend to adopt this mode for cheerful tunes, John WIlliams one of its main adepts using it in themes such as ET and Back to the Future.</li>



<li><strong>Mixolodyan:</strong> similar to Ionian but with a flattened 7th is characteristic for having a lack of leading tone, which makes it sound smoother than a major scale. It is commonly used in traditional songs from England and Ireland, as well as tunes from Northeastern Brazil, such as Forró. It is also used in rock guitar solos since the flattened 7th exists in the 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th chords.</li>



<li><strong>Aeolian:</strong> is the same as a natural minor scale and its characteristic sound comes from the positioning of its two semitones &#8211; between the 2nd and 3rd, and the 5th and 6th. The repetition of these intervals is perceived as conveying grief, pain or misery. It can be heard in Chopin&#8217;s Marche Funebre as well as Nirvana&#8217;s Smells Like Teen Spirit.</li>



<li><strong>Locrian: </strong>is the least used mode because of its lack of a perfect fifth and a presence of a tritone between the 1st and 5th. It is extremely dissonant and unstable with an extreme tension that lends it a dark mood. It&#8217;s hard to find examples of songs using this mode, but Björk&#8217;s Army Of Me is one of the few examples that keep appearing.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Claude Debussy&#8217;s &#8220;Prélude à l&#8217;après-midi d&#8217;un faune&#8221; is a musical composition that is based on the poem &#8220;L’après-midi d’un faune&#8221; Stéphane Mallarmé. The poem tells the story of a faun, a mythical creature who is half-man and half-goat, as he wakes up from a nap in the forest and is overwhelmed by lustful desires towards nymphs. </p>



<p>This bucolic poem represented a historic milestone of literary symbolism. It places emphasis on the stimuli surrounding the action, rather than the action itself. This creates a reality that is diffuse, with a stronger focus on perception than representation. Is the faun dreaming? Or is all that real? The reader never knows. What is true is that the poem is full of ambiguity and musicality, taking advantage of the French language and its nuances: colour, vowels, and diphthongs. Mallarmé followed the French belief of that time: &#8220;how you say something is as important as what you say: style (timbre) is as important as substance (pitch and rhythm)&#8221; (Greenberg, 2013).</p>



<p>Debussy&#8217;s &#8220;Prélude à l&#8217;après-midi d&#8217;un faune,&#8221; composed between 1892 and 1894, is a musical reflection of the elusive ambiguity present in Mallarmé&#8217;s poem. The fluid rhythms and tonal uncertainties of Debussy&#8217;s composition effectively capture the hazy, indistinct quality of Mallarmé&#8217;s writing.</p>



<p>I believe it cannot be considered a symphonic poem, as it does not adhere to a narrative or a formal structure based on the exposition-development-recapitulation sequence. Instead, it flows freely, mimicking the emotions of its titular character. This free-form approach was a wise decision, as it keeps the listener engaged and constantly surprised. With each listening, one is never quite certain where the music is headed, making for a captivating and unpredictable musical experience.</p>



<p>Starting from the famous opening flute melody, which has an emphasis on the tritone (the ambiguous interval), followed by the horns and soft harp glissandos, set a dreamy and soft awaking tone that resembles the opening of the poem.</p>



<p>One of the most intriguing parts for me starts in bar 17, where the oboe and clarinet produce a sensual and exotic sound. They are then joined by the full orchestra before the clarinet is left to play alone. To me, it feels like the sound of the wind, a whisper, or a call. The repetition of the orchestra adds depth and enhances the overall effect, making this part truly captivating.</p>

<p>Debussy, in my opinion, uses all the sounds and timbres at his disposal to convey the emotions he perceives in Mallarmé&#8217;s poem. He does not follow a specific structure or formal harmonic progression or even tries to follow the story of the poem. Instead, he uses the music as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself, being effective in evoking senses beyond the earthly and capable of creating a fantastical and almost hypnotic musical experience. </p>



<p>This approach aligns with the principles of impressionist painters and symbolist poets who were more concerned with evoking emotions through their work, rather than simply creating a realistic representation. This shift in perspective paved the way for the development of modern art as we know it today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="IGOR STRAVINSKY Symphonies of Wind Instruments (1947 version)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VyKTujyLie4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>During my research on Debussy, I discovered that he and Stravinsky were close friends. Following Debussy&#8217;s death, Stravinsky paid tribute by composing a serene chorale, which was later incorporated into the &#8220;Symphonies of Wind Instruments&#8221; in 1920. In 1945, Stravinsky revised the work, publishing it in 1947, and made alterations including the removal of the alto flute and alto clarinet, as well as reworking the musical score.</p>



<p>After listening to it the first time, I absolutely loved this piece. I keep finding Stravinsky&#8217;s work amazing and it&#8217;s one of the composers I most like to listen to, but at the same time is the one I find most difficult to analyze. In the next paragraphs I&#8217;ll try to understand what made me like this piece.</p>



<p>The first hint comes from the title. The &#8220;Symphonies of Wind Instruments&#8221; is a musical work with a title that alludes to the original definition of symphony (as opposed to the musical form) as a harmonious blending of instruments. That&#8217;s one of the characteristics of this piece that stroke me right away. The interplay between the different wind instruments, particularly in terms of the contrasting chromatic tones between the woodwinds and brass, is particularly striking. Stravinsky&#8217;s manipulation of the instruments, such as in bar 3 where he plays a Bb in the trumpet and a B in the clarinets, creates a unique sonic landscape that highlights the tonal differences between the instruments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="774" height="900" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1243" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41.png 774w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41-258x300.png 258w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41-768x893.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41-300x349.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41-640x744.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /></figure>



<p>The formal structure of the piece proves to be elusive and challenging to categorize. It frequently alternates between tempos, including 144, 108, and 72 beats per minute, which are related by a ratio of 2:3:4. The fluctuating time signature only adds to the impression of multiple distinct musical ideas being woven together in the composition.</p>



<p>From the beginning, Stravinsky introduces contrasting thematic materials, switching between joyful flutes, mournful full chords, and the chorale theme, which symbolizes Debussy&#8217;s death or funeral. Throughout the piece, there is no clear narrative or progression. The musical ideas seem to shift abruptly, giving the impression of a series of disconnected fragments.</p>



<p>The chorale theme, which recurs throughout the piece, serves as a unifying thread and provides the piece with a sense of direction. It becomes the focus of the conclusion, which is joyful and uplifting, spreading a sense of peace and resolution.</p>



<p> </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a significant transformation in society as a result of rapid advancements in science and technology. The invention of new forms of communication led to a change in perceptions of time, space and distance. All these frenetic changes paved the way for new ideas, new perceptions and a new ability to process art that led artists to completely break with the old ways of doing art and start thinking about how they can be relevant in a constant-changing world.</p>



<p>Beyond the hyper expressivity and the “abortive gesture” &#8211; doing the “wrong” thing for the “right” expressive reason &#8211; there were technological advances in materials such as recordings or new canvas that allowed artists to explore their expressions outside.</p>



<p>It was in this context that two styles emerged: impressionism and symbolism.</p>



<p>The Impressionist movement in art sought to capture the reality of the modern world, taking inspiration from the realism of Gustave Courbet. The movement was characterized by its emphasis on capturing the fleeting and ephemeral aspects of light and colour in outdoor environments, diverging from the established tradition of creating posed and historical compositions in a studio setting.</p>



<p>The term &#8220;Impressionism&#8221; as a label for the movement gained widespread recognition following the criticism by Louis Leroy of Claude Monet&#8217;s &#8220;Impression, Sunrise&#8221; (Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris) in 1874, which he disparagingly referred to as a mere &#8220;impression&#8221;.</p>



<p>The chief exponents of Impressionism were Paris-based and include Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas in visual arts and Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel in music.</p>



<p>In contrast, the Symbolist movement was characterized by the use of symbols and imagery to express deeper, abstract concepts and emotions. The movement was influenced by the ideas of Charles Baudelaire and other Symbolist poets, who sought to evoke a deeper meaning beyond the literal representation of objects or scenes in their works.</p>



<p>Prominent Symbolists, such as Paul Gauguin, James Whistler, Gustave Moreau, and Odilon Redon, utilized this approach to explore themes such as spirituality, the unconscious, and the imagination.</p>



<p>But in the end, both Impressionists and Symbolists shared a motivation to represent the ephemeral and emotional elements of experience, in order to facilitate the expression of the artist&#8217;s feelings. These movements disrupted conventional modes of artistic expression and established avenues for subsequent art movements, be it through visual arts, poetry, or music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I approached this assignment by first thinking about the piece&#8217;s structure, drawing inspiration from Bach&#8217;s violin sonata. I researched various baroque dances, such as the Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, and Gigue, and decided to use the Allemande as a primary inspiration because of its 4/4 meter and binary form. After going through the chords several times, I decided to make my piece in binary form as well: the first section from bar 1 to bar 16 and the second from bar 17 to bar 33.</p>



<p>I chose the first section to be 16 bars long, as this is a common length for the first section of dances like Allemande and Bach&#8217;s sonata. Additionally, the perfect cadence from bar 15 (C major) to bar 16 (F major) and the transition from F major to Bb major in bar 17 made it a logical choice. The presence of rehearsal letters also hinted that there would be a break in this section.</p>



<p>As soon as I determined the structure of my composition, <a href="./../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" target="_blank">I reviewed my previous analysis of Bach&#8217;s violin sonata to better understand his techniques</a>. </p>



<p>My composition plan was to introduce the main theme of the sonata in the first bars and then explore it with repetitions and variations until the end of the A section. The B section would start with a similar theme, but with some slight changes to keep it fresh and then move to the main theme until the end of the piece.</p>



<p>One of the challenges I faced right at the beginning of the composition was finding the right rhythms and notes. I tried several combinations and ideas but I ended up feeling that they didn&#8217;t match the Baroque style I was aiming for. Either sounded too simple or too uninteresting. My solution was to borrow material from my previous exercise, which was based on Bach&#8217;s Sonata for Viola da Gamba &amp; Harpsichord in G Minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="676" height="242" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1165" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png 676w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-300x107.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-640x229.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Exercise 3.4 theme</figcaption></figure>



<p>But even after finding a theme, I wasn&#8217;t satisfied with how it sounded in the first four bars, so I decided to begin it at rehearsal mark A (bar 5) and develop it from there. Overall, I was pleased with how the melody turned out and specifically enjoyed applying the lessons I learned from Bach by allowing the C# in bar 8 to move to bar 9 instead of resolving to D.</p>



<p>There was a challenge with the first 4 bars since I lacked ideas as to what to do in order to make them interesting. My solution was to write an introduction that hinted at the main theme&#8217;s rhythm, as a preview of what was to come. Despite not being able to find out whether an introduction was common to the Baroque style, I decided to include it since it made sense in this composition.</p>



<p>My goal in the B section was to make the violin sound freer, but not totally different from the previous section. In order to achieve this, I kept the tied note and the three descending notes from the main theme.</p>



<p>The next step was ornamenting the violin and the treble harpsichord. I looked into Taylor (1998), Apel (1969) and Bach (1949) for guidance and kept in mind that Bach used ornamentations at the perfect timing. The main difficulty I faced was understanding how to write the first and final notes on the trills regarding the previous and the next note. For example, in bars 2 and 12, the previous note is the same upper note of the trill. Should the player play it two times or make it tied? I couldn&#8217;t find a definitive answer but it made sense to me to be tied.</p>

<p>In bars 29 and 30, I decided to incorporate a suspiran, which is a technique I learned from an article by Peter Williams (1979).</p>

<p>Overall, I am pleased with how I was able to incorporate elements from Bach&#8217;s sonata into my composition, but I am aware that it may not sound as authentically Baroque as it could. Sometimes it sounds too contemporary. Possibly the pivotal question is this: How can we write in the style of a specific era if we have been influenced by later ones? This may be a constant challenge that composers face, and it&#8217;s something that I kept in mind throughout the composition process. Despite this, I am happy with the final result and how it captures the essence of the Baroque style while incorporating my own creative choices.</p>

<p>Vivaldi Recomposed, composed by the British composer Max Richter and performed by the Konzerthaus Kammerorchester Berlin, is a reinterpretation of Antonio Vivaldi&#8217;s iconic Four Seasons. Richter, known for his unique blend of classical and contemporary music, masterfully weaves themes and ideas from the original composition and adds his modern touch to create a fresh and exciting listening experience.</p>



<p>When I first heard about Vivaldi Recomposed, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder why a composer would take on such a bold and daring task. After all, the Four Seasons is considered a masterpiece, so why would anyone want to tamper with it? But Richter&#8217;s response to this question was simple and illuminating: &#8220;It&#8217;s just everywhere. In a way, we stop being able to hear it.&#8221; (Service, 2017). And with that, it all made sense. The Four Seasons has become so ubiquitous that it has become background noise. I prefer to look at this work as a wake-up call or a provocation to think about something you take for granted.</p>



<p>After listening to it more than once, a few elements caught my attention. First and foremost, Richter&#8217;s work is not an arrangement of the original piece, but an entirely reimagined interpretation based on Vivaldi&#8217;s core. This became clear to me when my 5-year-old daughter began whistling like a bird when I listened to the Spring movement. Richter effectively conveyed the birds singing as Vivaldi intended, but in a creative and innovative way.</p>



<p>Another aspect that caught my attention was the simplicity and repetition of the movements. I don&#8217;t see it as superior or inferior to Vivaldi&#8217;s original, but a reflection of modern aesthetics valuing repetition over baroque flamboyance, and Richter&#8217;s style emphasizing prolonged notes played over repetitive themes (e.g. Infra 8).</p>



<p>Additionally, the use of synthesizers in the piece was particularly interesting to me, as they were used not to over-modernize the soundscape, but rather as a hint of modernity that amplified the range of sounds and added depth to the strings.</p>



<p>I can rephrase the initial &#8220;Why?&#8221; to &#8220;Should?&#8221; I believe the answer is yes, composers like Richter should continue creating recomposed works, <a href="./../../../listening-to-boris-blacher-variations-on-a-theme-of-paganini/index.html" data-type="post" data-id="135" target="_blank">as I previously observed</a>.</p>



<p>I believe music is a living and organic force, not a static one. The reason for this is that musical instruments evolved, tuning evolved, and players evolved. Therefore, the way we hear these compositions today doesn&#8217;t sound the way they did when previous composers such as Vivaldi composed them. By reimagining these works, we not only pay tribute to the greats of the past but also ensure that music lives on for generations to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Reading &#8220;How to Listen to Great Music&#8221; by Robert Greenberg has been an invaluable resource in learning how to listen to and analyze music. The author suggests listening to Bach&#8217;s Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 as a way to gain a deeper understanding of Baroque concertos, with a particular emphasis on the ritornello. The concerto, which is composed for flute, solo violin, harpsichord, and strings, presents several interesting features upon listening and studying the score.</p>



<p>Right from the start of the concerto, I noticed the ritornello theme, which was highlighted by Greenberg, and how it reappears in fragments throughout the movement before being repeated in the end after the harpsichord solo.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="547" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-1024x547.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1209" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-1024x547.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-300x160.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-768x410.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-640x342.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-960x513.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29.png 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ritornello Theme</figcaption></figure>



<p>As Greenberg explains in his book, the function of the ritornello theme is to create a sense of logical inevitability, providing a feeling of returning home and familiarity, even if only for a brief moment. This helps the listener relax and not be overwhelmed by constant new sounds.</p>



<p>It works similarly to a chorus in modern-day popular music. but it typically appears at the beginning and end of the movement, while choruses in contemporary music typically appear in the middle and end of songs. I am curious as to why composers have shifted the placement of this familiar theme from the beginning to the middle of their compositions.</p>



<p>This movement also stands out for its unique use of the harpsichord as a solo instrument. While it was often used as a continuo instrument in the past, Bach elevated its role to that of a true solo instrument, giving it equal importance alongside the flute and violin. According to Greenberg, this concerto marks a significant moment in music history as the harpsichord&#8217;s solo capabilities were truly showcased for the first time. </p>



<p>The second movement of the concerto is an affettuoso, characterized by its melodic singing between the flute and violin. As I listened, I noticed two features that I had previously encountered in Bach&#8217;s violin sonata &#8211; the use of long, melodic lines that persistently avoid resolving to a steady cadence (as exemplified by the flute&#8217;s quick movement to C), and the repetition of a rhythmic pattern (in this case, quaver-quaver-dotted semiquaver-demisemiquaver) throughout the entire movement.</p>

<p>The third movement starts with the exposition of a fugal theme by the violin, which is then repeated by the flute. However, as the movement progresses, the violin and flute often play in unison, rather than in counterpoint as is typical in a true fugue. Despite this, there is a significant use of polyphonic texture throughout the movement.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>This sonata looks like a good example of Baroque music, characterized by its long melodic lines and ornamental elements. Upon listening to it for the first time played by Glenn Gould and Yehudi Menuhin, I feel that there&#8217;s an interesting contrast between the smoothness of the violin and the pointed, moving accompaniment of the harpsichord. After listening to it several times and studying the score, I noticed several unique features.</p>



<p>One of the key observations I made was that the harpsichord had a repetitive pattern, which allowed the violin to take centre stage. The bass harpsichord usually played a continuous arpeggio starting on the downbeat, while the treble harpsichord had an upward and downward motion with its highest note on the second note of the violin rhythm. The violin melody, in section A, seemed to be a long single melody that lasted 16 bars. Although I could definitely hear that the melody line didn&#8217;t settle until bar 16 and it seemed like Bach avoided a cadence in bars 8 and 12, I was unsure of how he achieved this effect. But my tutor helped clarify that it was a mixture of harmony, not having a perfect cadence, melody/rhythm notes that cross bars, and the use of weaker inversions of chords that gave a feeling of movement instead of a final rest. I hadn&#8217;t thought about how inverting chords could transmit a sense movement and it made much more sense to me after his answer.</p>



<p>Another observation I made was the rhythm of the violin melody and its repetition. This movement of the sonata is a Siciliano which is a musical style from the baroque era, usually in a slow 6/8 time and in a minor key. The violin follows the traditional Siciliana rhythms with a dotted quaver &#8211; semiquaver &#8211; quaver. It&#8217;s interesting to notice that Bach uses this exact rhythm 36 times and some of its variations throughout this movement but without making it feel repetitive. The use of ornamentation is essential here.</p>

<p>Overall, I find this piece to be deceptively simple yet incredibly evocative and emotionally charged. Reflecting on its various features has helped me gain a deeper understanding of how to approach my assignment with greater insight and understanding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The exercise proved to be more challenging than anticipated. I began by creating the chords as outlined in the instructions, which was enjoyable and entertaining. It took some time to figure out the different melodic lines and determine whether, for example, the bass should move upward or downward from bar 1 to bar 2. Ultimately, I ended up with more dynamic lines in the Tenor and Bass compared to the Soprano and Alto, which appeared to be a bit static.</p>



<p>The most challenging aspect for me was developing the melodic lines. I found that the Tenor and Bass lines were easier to work with and changing them added an interesting rhythm to the phrase. In beat 3 of bar 1, I added a passing note to the Tenor to shorten the leap. In bar 3, I continued to add quavers to the Tenor and Bass to maintain a similar rhythm as the first part.</p>



<p>Upon examining Bach’s harmonization, I noticed that the main difference was that he added much more interest to bar 4, particularly with the descending Tenor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During my research, I discovered that Bach is well-known for his prolific composition of cantatas, both secular and sacred. He developed the &#8220;chorale cantata&#8221; style and at his most productive, he composed one cantata per week for eight years. Between 1723 and 1729, Bach completed four yearly cycles consisting of about 60 cantatas each (Greer, 2002).</p>



<p>&#8220;Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140&#8221; is one of his most famous cantatas which relates the story from Matthew 25:1-13, about the ten virgins waiting for the arrival of the bridegroom (Christ).</p>



<p>This Cantata follows a symmetrical structure where it includes a chorale in the middle movement and is framed by two sets of recitative-aria movements. The cantata begins and ends with chorale-choruses, which I found to be a common feature in Bach’s compositions.</p>



<p>After listening to the cantata three times (without the score, with the score and after my research), I found it to be a dramatic and theatrical piece, but even more impressive when I learned about the context in which it was performed in a church setting.</p>



<p>For example, in the first movement, the ritornello in the first 4 bars reminded me of a wedding and it was only after my research that I found out that the setting of this movement is the calling of all Jerusalem to prepare for a wedding feast. Another example of dramatism is how the voices of this first movement don’t start singing together, but arrive one by one, as if they are arriving at the event.</p>

<p>The uplifting feeling in the first movement comes from the serene instrumentation combined with the uplifting lines of the chorale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="256" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-1024x256.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1161" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-1024x256.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-300x75.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-768x192.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-1536x383.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-2048x511.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-640x160.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00-960x240.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-21.48.00.png 2228w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I found the second movement to be like a narrator, with the Tenor voice, moving the story forward. The third movement is a dialogue between the Soul (Soprano) and Jesus (Bass) and in the fourth movement, I found the conjunction of a simple melody line of the tenor with a danceable string melody supported by the continuous movement of the continuo very pleasing. </p>



<p>The seventh movement, the last choral part, is a hymn so that all the congregation can join and sing in a final movement. That&#8217;s why the soprano sings the melody and the other voices fill in the harmony.</p>



<p>I found listening to Cantata No. 140 by Bach enjoyable, but it was more enriching to understand the meaning and context of the composition. At first, I didn&#8217;t fully grasp the nuances and constructions Bach made, but by learning more about cantatas and their role in bringing people together in a church setting, I was able to appreciate it more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The exercise proved to be more complex and time-consuming than anticipated. I began by creating the bass line, using a continuous quaver pattern like Bach does in the sonata I was studying. However, I decided to make the line ascend and descend in all bars except for bar 3. Then, I moved on to the treble line where I attempted to imitate Bach&#8217;s repetitive style but found it lacking interest. To add some variety, I incorporated some rhythm borrowed from Bach&#8217;s Sonata for Viola da Gamba &amp; Harpsichord in G Minor. Finally, I wrote the melody, which proved to be challenging due to the prominent harpsichord treble line. I found myself questioning if that&#8217;s why Bach kept it repetitive. Despite this, I completed the violin melody, complementing the harpsichord.</p>



<p>In regards to cadence, I tried to leave it unresolved, similar to Bach in his sonata but found that the unresolved cadence is more prominent in the harpsichord line than the violin.</p>



<p>In the end, I was not entirely satisfied with the violin melody. I believe it needs to be made more distinct and not so closely tied to the harpsichord.</p>



<p></p>

<p>After closely analyzing Bach&#8217;s piece, I gained a deeper understanding of the movement of chords, particularly the bass line. I observed how skillfully he transitioned from the C minor scale to the G major. This prompted me to redo the exercise, attempting to replicate Bach&#8217;s approach on the harpsichord more closely.</p>



<p>To my surprise, the exercise seemed simpler this time around. Whether it was due to having done it previously or my increasing knowledge of Bach&#8217;s writing, I am not sure. I transferred my original harpsichord treble line to the violin and wrote the harpsichord lines afterwards.</p>



<p>Overall, I was quite pleased with the outcome of my second attempt. The piece appeared more cohesive, with the violin melody standing out without constant competition from the other lines.</p>

<p>Although I appreciate pop music, I&#8217;m usually turned away from songs that are too popular on the charts. But, when I stumbled upon SZA&#8217;s &#8220;Kill Bill&#8221; on the radio without knowing what it was, I was extremely surprised. The song really caught my attention. My impression was that the song never settled down, a feeling (a very good feeling) I also had when <a href="./../../../listening-to-beach-boys-god-only-knows/index.html" data-type="post" data-id="531" target="_blank">listening to God Only Knows</a>.</p>



<p>The aspect that impressed me the most was the chorus vocal melody. It was straightforward yet stunning and flowed smoothly. Upon transcribing it, I discovered the song was in Ab Major, but the vocal melody only utilized the Ab once on the last note of the 4th beat, which was a rather weak one. There was also an A flat, a chromatic note just a half-step from the tonic, leading to a sense of uncertainty and incompletion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="74" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1024x74.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1222" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1024x74.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-300x22.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-768x55.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1536x111.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-2048x148.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-640x46.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-960x69.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26.png 2578w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The chord progression also caught my attention. Throughout the song, it used the same progression: Bbm-Eb-Ab-F or ii-V-I-VI. This again contributed to a sense of instability as it started on ii and placed the I on the third bar, which is a weaker position for establishing the key. The final chord was a modulation to a chromatic chord of F Major, which was my favourite part of the chorus. It was playful, and daring, and complemented the lyrics perfectly (e.g. &#8220;Rather be in jail than alone&#8221;).</p>



<p>But right from the beginning, the song starts off sounding vague. There&#8217;s a distinct out-of-tune waver that is completely undefined. From that point, the song could head in any direction. Then, the drum beat enters and as with any typical pop song, you anticipate listening to a four-beat loop until the vocals begin. But the vocals come in on the fourth beat, like an anacrusis, unexpectedly.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I don&#8217;t think &#8220;Kill Bill&#8221; will be regarded as a masterpiece like &#8220;God Only Knows,&#8221; but in today&#8217;s landscape of overwhelming similar-sounding pop music, I found the song to be invigorating. I hope it serves as inspiration for other artists to create pop music that departs from standard harmonic and melodic structures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ornamentation was one of the prominent features of the Baroque era and can be loosely described as the practice of embellishing music by adding extra notes and little figures in a very specific style.</p>



<p>Although there is evidence that the ornamentation of melodies goes back to early singers of Gregorian chant, it wasn&#8217;t until the late Renaissance and early Baroque that the ornamentation became codified. It was in France, that the practice of ornamentation in music was standardized under the name &#8220;agréments,&#8221; allowing for the use of signs or abbreviations to indicate them in a score (Apel, 1969).</p>



<p>In order to understand why ornamentation in music was so prominent in the Baroque era, especially the late Baroque, I turned to the article &#8220;Late Baroque Ornamentation: Philosophy and Guideline&#8221; by David Lasocki in which the author details six purposes for the extensive use of these decorative elements during this period.</p>



<p>First, according to the author, it was an essential component of the Baroque aesthetic, emphasising the ornate and decorative. Second, it gave the performer &#8220;an opportunity to demonstrate their judgement, inventiveness, and insight&#8221;. Third, performers had more training and desire to play more than the music exactly as written. Fourth, ornamentation added verve and freshness to the performance through spontaneous recomposition. Fifth, ornamentation helped to create variety in multiple performances of the same work. Finally, it was expected by both performers and audiences, since performers would likely have attempted to use ornamentation in order to please their colleagues and audiences (Lasocki, 1988).</p>



<p>According to Robert Donington in The Interpretation of Early Music, there were more than one hundred and twenty-five signs used in early music, but Victor Rangel-Ribeiro claims that only four were used enough &#8220;to have become characteristic of Baroque music&#8221; (Rangel-Ribeiro, 2016): the appoggiatura (a dissonant note resolving on the weaker beat to the next note above or below), the trill (rapid alternation of the main note with a higher auxiliary note), the mordent (a rapid alternation of the main note with the note immediately below it), and the turn (a decorative flourish consisting of a rapid alternation of the main note with the note above it).</p>



<p>One of the challenges in interpreting Baroque ornamentation is that there was a degree of flexibility and subjectivity in how these ornaments were performed. While composers often provided indications for the use of ornamentation in their scores, they did not always specify exactly how the ornaments should be performed. This left room for interpretation and allowed performers to add their own personal flair and expression to the music.</p>



<p>Composers used various signs to indicate different ornaments, but there was no standardized set of ornamentation symbols. To help clarify which sign was being used for which ornament, some composers included tables of ornaments in their publications starting in the late seventeenth century (Schulenberg, 2001). One of the examples is Bach&#8217;s:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="289" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1130" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png 750w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-300x116.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-640x247.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bach, J.S. and Wolff, C. (2022) <em>Notebook for Wilhelm Friedemann Bach 1720 (Edition Peters) (German Edition)</em>. Alfred Music.</figcaption></figure>



<p>During the period between 1650 and 1750, the practice of writing ornaments as notes in music was considered detrimental to the clarity of the melodic line. J.S. Bach, in particular, was criticized for writing down the ornaments and embellishments that performers were expected to add instinctively. &#8220;He writes down in actual notes the ornaments and embellishments that performers are accustomed to supply instinctively, a habit which not only sacrifices the harmonic beauty of his music but also makes the melody totally indistinct&#8221; (Apel, 1969).</p>



<p>Overall, ornamentation was a central aspect of Baroque music, both in terms of its aesthetic and its performance practice. It was used to add interest, variety, and drama to the music, and was an important part of the composer-performer partnership of the time.</p>

<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been enjoying it more and more the cello. Actually, I think  I&#8217;m particularly drawn to low-pitched instruments like the acoustic bass, bassoon, and cello. When I learned that Schubert wrote a piece for a string quintet with a second cello instead of the usual second viola, I was curious to listen to it.</p>



<p>Listening to it was an emotional journey. The piece seemed to effortlessly shift from one mood to another. For instance, in the first movement (10:03-13:05), it transitioned from a beautiful melodic line to an intense, almost violent cello and back to the melodic line and again back to an angry mood. All this in just 3 minutes.</p>



<p>Sometimes the piece reminded me of Beethoven. For example, at the beginning of the third movement (00:00-04:03), where there is such a strength that it almost looks like an entire orchestra is playing. I think sometimes I could hear a brass instrument within the strings, and it&#8217;s amazing how Schubert was able to create such magic.</p>



<p>I think the decision to use two cellos gave the piece a full orchestral sound, especially during moments with a darker mood, such as the first movement.</p>



<p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this piece and it has sparked my interest in exploring Schubert&#8217;s other works.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As I worked through the exercises, I found that realizing figured bass was more challenging than I initially expected. While I had an understanding of harmony and chord structure, applying this knowledge to the figured bass notation required me to think more critically and pay attention to the specific intervals and chord qualities indicated by the figures.</p>



<p>Despite the initial difficulty, I found that the process of realizing figured bass became easier and more intuitive as I continued to work through the exercises. I enjoyed the process of analyzing the figures and determining the appropriate chords to use in each situation.</p>



<p>One aspect of figured bass that I found particularly appealing was the way it allows for a balance between structure and creativity. As with the counterpoint rules we studied before, there are certain conventions to follow, but there is still room to make choices. While the basic harmonic structure is provided by the figured bass symbols, the performer is given the freedom to interpret and realize those chords in a way that fits the musical context and their own artistic vision.</p>



<p>Overall, I found the process of realizing figured bass to be both challenging and rewarding. While it may not be a technique that I would use in my own music-making (does any composer use it today? I couldn&#8217;t find an answer), I can see how it could be a useful tool for composers and players in order to keep everyone on the same register. Additionally, I believe that the process of realizing figured bass has helped me to deepen my understanding of harmony and chord structure, which will undoubtedly be beneficial in my future musical endeavours.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There are many different ways in which instruments can be tuned, and the method used has varied throughout&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are many different ways in which instruments can be tuned, and the method used has varied throughout history and across different cultures. In Western classical music, the most commonly used tuning system is equal temperament (more specifically the 12-tone equal temperament), in which each note is separated from the next by a fixed interval known as a semitone. This system allows for the easy transposition of music and the ability to play in any key, but can sometimes result in less pure-sounding intervals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-1120" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38.jpeg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-300x225.jpeg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-768x576.jpeg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-640x480.jpeg 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-960x720.jpeg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Before the widespread use of equal temperament, other tuning systems were commonly employed. Pythagoras, in the 6th century BC, developed a tuning system based on perfect fifths with a 3:2 ratio. This system, known as Pythagorean tuning, is a form of Just Intonation that preserves the pure sound of fifths but has the drawback of producing out-of-tune thirds, which were not commonly used before the Renaissance. To address this issue, just temperament was developed.</p>



<p>During the Renaissance, the Meantone system of tuning was developed as musicians searched for new ways to experiment with tonality and harmony. It differed from the Pythagorean system in that it focused on the major third rather than the root and fifth, enabling the creation of more harmonious melodies by making dissonant notes more in tune. This system also introduced its own dissonances, known as wolf intervals.</p>



<p>In the Meantone temperament, the octave can be divided into more than 12 pitches, producing distinct pitches for notes like G♯ and A♭. Some keyboard instruments were designed to accommodate these additional pitches.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Quarter-comma Meantone with split sharps" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7GhAuZH6phs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>During the Baroque era, &#8220;well-tempered&#8221; systems became popular. These tuning systems slightly adjust the intervals between the pitches of an instrument to optimize its performance in a specific key or range of keys. The tunings of the notes are not perfectly aligned with a particular scale, like equal temperament, but rather are adjusted to produce more pleasant melodies and harmonies in a particular key or set of keys. This allows for greater flexibility and expressiveness in music, as different keys can have their own unique tonal characteristics.</p>



<p>In the early 20th century, Czech composer Alois Hába introduced microtonal music, a new tuning system featuring intervals smaller than a semitone. This system allows for more complex and interesting harmonies, but requires specialized instruments and can be challenging for musicians trained in equal temperament to play.</p>



<p>This is just a brief overview of Western tuning systems. In other parts of the world, other systems have been used. For instance, Indian classical music frequently employs just intonation, with the addition of shruti, intervals smaller than those normally found between notes, similar to cents in Western music (<em>Microtones in Indian Classical Music</em>, no date). In the modern Arab tone system, the octave is divided into 24 equal intervals known as quarter tones. The specific notes used in a piece belong to one of more than seventy modes or maqam rows.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This turned out harder than I thought. The process of writing the numbers of the figured bass is slower than realising the figured bass. After checking against the solution, I realised I made several mistakes as shown below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="254" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-1024x254.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1104" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-1024x254.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-300x74.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-768x191.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-1536x381.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-2048x508.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-640x159.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-960x238.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">First attempt</figcaption></figure>



<p>I forgot the F# in the first bar and missed the 4+. Strangely, bar 3 has the same first chord, but I added a # to it. Clearly, there was a lack of attention.</p>



<p>That first chord in bar 3 is a 7th chord, so the 4+ should replace the lonely #.</p>



<p>Likewise, I forgot to add the b to the Ab chord. As well as the chords in bar 4 where I did not add the accidentals.</p>



<p>There is only one question I have left. The solution did not contain figured bass in the second note in bar 3. How much should be written?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="240" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-1024x240.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1105" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-1024x240.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-768x180.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-1536x360.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-2048x480.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-640x150.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-960x225.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Correct Figured Bass</figcaption></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This exercise was fun because it allowed me to experiment with different chord voicings and try to incorporate some voice-leading and melodic shapes. As I experimented with different spacings, I noticed that closer chords sounded muddier, whereas spread chords were much sharper and more detailed. I used these spread chords to add punctuation to certain parts of the composition, such as in bar 6.</p>
