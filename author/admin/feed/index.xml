<p><strong>Programme notes</strong></p>



<p>The beauty of twilight time, between sunset and moonrise, has captivated human beings for centuries. The Latins had an expression for this special time of day &#8211; &#8220;lux quae fugit,&#8221; which translates to &#8220;the light that flees.&#8221; This phrase captures the ephemeral and fleeting nature of twilight, which often invokes a mixture of feelings. Some may feel nostalgic for the day that is ending while others may feel peaceful for the night to start. Despite the tumultuous emotions that arise, the eventual arrival of night inevitably brings a sense of calm and tranquillity.</p>



<p><strong>Composition</strong></p>



<p>My composition takes inspiration from Impressionist music, particularly Debussy&#8217;s preludes. The piece is structured into three distinct parts: the relaxing day, the tumultuous feelings of twilight, and the peace of the night.</p>



<p>To achieve an Impressionistic sound, I started by experimenting with various pentatonic scales on the piano, ultimately settling on the arpeggio of the C# minor pentatonic. This scale forms the basis for the first part of the prelude, with modulations to C# Dorian  (bars 5-6) and A Dorian (bars 7-8).</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a brief transition where I actually don&#8217;t know which C major mode I wrote, but I believe it sounds like a D Dorian until it settles in a C Mixolydian.</p>



<p>The middle section of the piece is marked by a play between C Mixolydian and a Whole Tone scale, with a brief detour into the Whole Tone scale based on Eb (bars 18-19). This leads into the &#8220;cascading&#8221; section, where the music moves from the C Mixolydian to the G major modes of A Dorian and B Phrygian, ending in E harmonic minor. This section aims to explore the extremes of the piano, creating a mysterious feeling of going up and down simultaneously.</p>



<p>The final section of the prelude moves from D Major to G Major and ends in C Major, evoking a sense of peace and tranquillity after the tumultuous emotions of twilight.</p>



<p>Throughout the piece, I utilize a pedal tone to build tension and create a sense of stationary motion.</p>



<p>Overall, my goal in this composition was to capture the essence of Impressionist music by exploring unique scales and timbres on the piano while conveying the range of emotions experienced during the transition from day to night.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Alban Berg (1885-1935), along with Anton Webern (1883–1945), were two of the three composers of the Second Viennese&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alban Berg (1885-1935), along with Anton Webern (1883–1945), were two of the three composers of the Second Viennese School which Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) pioneered. </p>



<p>Alban Berg, an Austrian composer born in Vienna, started his music education with Arnold Schoenberg in 1904. He was active during the remarkable artistic, musical, and literary upsurge in Vienna during the early 20th century, associating with prominent figures such as Gustav Klimt. Berg&#8217;s work is often viewed as more melodious and comprehensible than that of his mentor, Schoenberg. His most renowned compositions encompass a variety of musical forms, including orchestral music, such as Five Orchestral Songs (1912), chamber music, songs, and two pioneering operas, Wozzeck (1925) and Lulu (1937). The Violin Concerto, which Berg composed in 1935, is widely regarded as his masterpiece.</p>



<p>This piece was dedicated to Manon Gropius, the daughter of Alma Mahler and Walter Gropius, who died of polio at the age of eighteen. Berg crafted this piece in two movements, each of which comprised two distinct parts. The first movement adheres to the conventional sonata form, commencing with an Andante section and culminating with an Allegretto segment evocative of dance. This movement is deemed to symbolize life. The second movement primarily revolves around a recurring rhythmic cell (Allegro), which is succeeded by a sombre Adagio portion, portraying death.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="238" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bergs_tone_row_600px.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-1286" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bergs_tone_row_600px.jpeg 600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bergs_tone_row_600px-300x119.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Berg&#8217;s use of the twelve-tone row in the composition is considerably rooted in conventional harmony. This is due to the fact that the twelve-tone row can be divided into three triad chords, succeeded by notes of the whole tone scale that lead up to G. Alternatively, the tone row can be analyzed as G minor major 7, A minor major 7, followed by the notes of the whole tone scale.</p>



<p>Upon listening to the piece and studying the score, it appears that Berg&#8217;s selection of the tone row effectively established tonality into an essentially atonal framework. I believe that this decision contributed to the composers&#8217; capacity to pay tribute to Manon Gropius.</p>



<p>Ultimately, despite the rigorously technical structure, the composition evokes strong emotional sentiments and conveys profound expressivity.</p>



<p>Anton Webern, a notable composer and conductor, was also born in Vienna. In 1904 he started receiving composition lessons from Arnold Schoenberg. Webern is considered as one of the foremost proponents of the twelve-tone technique and is renowned for pushing it to its limits. Despite producing some orchestral works, his work primarily comprises vocal and instrumental chamber music, with only a single symphonic composition.</p>



<p>His compositional style is distinguished by its succinctness, brevity, and intensity. The composer undertook an exploration of innovative dimensions of musical expression, particularly atonality, while simultaneously exhibiting meticulous attention to detail, and at times, an exacting rigidity in his musical compositions. He was very fond of utilizing classical forms as a foundational framework upon which to construct his twelve-tone music. I believe that his compositional style is particularly evident in Symphony, Op.21.</p>



<p>In contrast to Berg&#8217;s concerto, Webern&#8217;s Symphony highlights a more radical utilization of the twelve-tone methodology. The use of canons in the first movement and the theme and variations in the second movement are a more methodical use for the twelve-tone. Despite the presence of classical forms in this composition, its analysis presents considerable challenges to me. The melody line, shaped by the canons and their inversions, rapidly transitions between different instruments, reflecting a distinctive style of Webern&#8217;s compositional style.</p>

Available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PDcD3PoYA4.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Webern&#8217;s implementation of the twelve-tone row methodology is characterized by a pronounced mathematical orientation, contrasting with Berg&#8217;s harmonic approach. The composer utilized a symmetrical row structure that may be divided into two parts, with the second part representing a retrograde of the first. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the interval between the first and twelfth, second and eleventh, and so forth, is always a tritone. This row exemplifies Webern&#8217;s preference for the utilization of half-steps in his compositions.</p>

<p>After listening to it several times, I feel that the composition is distinguished by its minimalistic character and sparse texture. Despite the limited instrumentation, the piece is remarkable for its extraordinary intensity. The attention to detail is evident in the nuanced interplay of instruments, where each contributes to a great variety of colour and texture, creating a dense and complex web of sounds that together form a cohesive whole.</p>

<p>I decided to listen to Devonté Hynes&#8217; music after reading a review in the Guardian of his concert with the London Symphony Orchestra. I didn&#8217;t know his work, so it was interesting to dig a bit into his work. </p>



<p>Devonté Hynes&#8217; Long Ride II is a two-piano rendition that was written for HBO&#8217;s Series “We Are Who We Are.” Hynes is primarily known for his R&amp;B and indie music, but he has recently been exploring classical music, which I find an interesting move. </p>



<p>The Long Ride II features a repetitive arpeggio and chords in one of the pianos, while the other builds upon the background, almost as if it is improvising. It has an impressionist feeling of improvisation, and perhaps in the live version, the pianist is really improvising.</p>



<p>The piece is based on an F major chord, and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a defined structure. Instead, there is an increase in texture that keeps growing until almost the finale where one of the pianos plays alone, which is like a return to the beginning.</p>



<p>Although Devonté Hynes&#8217; Long Ride II is an intriguing piece of music that showcases Hynes&#8217; exploration of classical music, its repetitive nature doesn&#8217;t appeals to me. Nonetheless, it was worth listening to it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite being perceived as holding irreconcilable positions by their contemporaries, it is now widely understood that the apparent conflict between Schoenberg and Stravinsky was largely manufactured by political propagandists. Contemporary views acknowledge that both artists shared similar aims and objectives.</p>



<p>During the interwar period, the Romantic era approached a state of near-collapse, as evidenced by the prevalence of monumental symphonic works and autobiographical tone poems. This led to a conscious rejection of the whole apparatus of late Romantic music and a call for a simpler, more objective music. They felt the need to go back in time, a nostalgia, for inspiration and perhaps a homage to previous composers such as Mozart, Bach or Beethoven, in order to bring some clarity and order to music. </p>



<p>Various artists had differing perspectives on the interpretation of &#8220;order&#8221;. Notably, serialists, particularly Schoenberg, regarded the notion of order as a strict construct, almost akin to the concept of law. In fact, Josef Matthias Hauer presented his &#8220;law of the twelve tones&#8221; in 1919.</p>



<p>In contrast, there were a group of artists who believed that this order should be less strict and more based on musical forms and stylistic features from previous eras, such as the Classical Period. This led to Neoclassicism.</p>



<p>Neoclassicism involved a rejection of the lush harmonies and exaggerated emotionalism of late Romanticism, as well as a rejection of modernism&#8217;s atonal and experimental tendencies. Instead, neoclassical composers sought to create clear, concise, and intellectually rigorous works using classical forms and structures such as the sonata, concerto, and symphony.</p>



<p>Although Prokofiev&#8217;s Classical Symphony (1918) may seem to be the first neoclassical work, the start of the movement is generally attributed to Igor Stravisnky&#8217;s Pulcinella (1919), a ballet using themes by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and other baroque composers. Stravinsky continued to explore neoclassical ideas in works such as the &#8220;Octet for Wind Instruments&#8221; (1923), the &#8220;Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments&#8221; (1924), and the &#8220;Symphony of Psalms&#8221; (1930). In these works, Stravinsky used classical forms and structures but also incorporated elements of modernism, such as dissonant harmonies and polyrhythms.</p>



<p>One of the most important Neoclassical artists was Paul Hindemith who systematically developed a new contrapuntal style, described as a 20th-century version of Bach.</p>



<p>Some other important composers that have written in neoclassical style are Satie, Bartók, Milhaud, de Falla or Tailleferre. </p>



<p>Given the considerable experimentation and creative exploration present in various musical styles in the early twentieth century, it is understandable why some regarded neoclassicism as a musical step backwards, a regression through past musical history. But as serialism, it is clear now that neoclassicism has become recognized as an important movement that synthesized new and old musical ideas and created a unique aesthetic that continues to inspire contemporary composers.</p>

<p>Gamelan music, originating from Java in Indonesia, features an ensemble of tuned metal instruments, including gongs and percussion instruments. This type of music is also found throughout Southeast Asia. The sound of gamelan music is characterized by an interplay of metallic sounds defined by one of two scales: slendro, which divides the octave into five equal intervals, and pelog, which divides it into seven.</p>



<p>Balinese music is structured like a tree, with different instruments symbolizing the trunk, branches, and flowers. The core melody, or pokok, is played by one group of instruments in one octave. Another group stresses this melody at regular intervals, while a third expands it into a full melody with a range of two to three octaves. A fourth group doubles and paraphrases it an octave higher, while a fifth group plays an ornamental figuration. Gongs punctuate and structure the music, while the drums provide rhythmic support.</p>



<p>Upon listening to gamelan music, one is struck by the clear and metallic sounds, which evoke the stirring of a thousand bells. The interplay of the sounds is delicate, and confused, and possesses a sensuous charm. The overall effect is one of mystery, which can be quite overpowering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The impact of Claude Debussy&#8217;s musical vocabulary on the evolution of jazz has been profound (Pamies, 2021), influencing a number of composers such as Duke Ellington, one of the founding fathers of jazz. (Ross, 2018).</p>



<p>To fully appreciate the compositional styles of Claude Debussy and Miles Davis, it is important to understand the underlying motivations that led to their musical breakthroughs. Both artists sought to distance themselves from the current artistic movements of their time, with Debussy aiming to break away from the influence of Germanic Romanticism and Davis seeking to move beyond the heavy tonality and fast harmonic rhythms of bebop jazz. In other words, both composers sought to break free from the constraints of their respective musical traditions and push the boundaries of what was possible in terms of harmonic and melodic freedom.</p>



<p>To achieve their respective goals, Debussy adopted an Impressionist style of music, while Davis found inspiration in modal jazz.</p>



<p>The 1959 release of Miles Davis&#8217; album, &#8220;Kind of Blue,&#8221; marked a pivotal moment in the history of jazz, especially the inaugural track of the album, &#8220;So What,&#8221; which is famous for being one of the first modal jazz songs.</p>



<p>Waters (2005) argues that there exist four salient techniques that typify modal jazz, namely the utilization of extended pedal points, suppression of standard harmonic progressions, slow harmonic rhythm, and association of a seven-note scalar collection with each harmony. The presence of these characteristics in the music of Debussy is a compelling evidence of his influence on jazz.</p>

<p>Besides the direct reference in the introduction to Debussy&#8217;s Voiles, both styles share a preoccupation with harmony and colour, and they tend to focus on creating a mood or atmosphere rather than following a rigid melodic or harmonic structure. Debussy’s use of whole-tone and pentatonic scales and unconventional chord progressions echo the modal jazz style that Davis developed in “So What.”</p>



<p>Regarding dissonance, one of Debussy&#8217;s biggest influences in this track in particular and in Jazz, in general, is the idea of “free dissonance”. The thinking that the 7th or 9th of a chord can exist as a sonority on its own without the need for resolution into a consonance. </p>



<p>Additionally, &#8220;So What&#8221; reflects another significant feature of Debussy&#8217;s style: improvisational feeling. Focusing on the use of a single mode or scale over extended periods and placing equal harmonic weight on all notes associated with a particular chord, resulted in a heightened sense of liberation in both melodic and harmonic exploration, ultimately fostering a greater degree of creative freedom for improvisation and experimentation.This approach influenced the genre and ultimately led to the development of Free Jazz.</p>



<p>Overall, it can be argued that Debussy&#8217;s influence on Miles Davis and Bill Evans can be summed up as promoting harmonic and melodic freedom, with a focus on color, imagination, and sound.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 1781, Franz Joseph Haydn composed his Op. 33 String Quartets, which he dedicated to the Grand Duke Paul of Russia. Consequently, these quartets are frequently referred to as the &#8220;Russian&#8221; quartets. The second quartet in E-flat, commonly known as the &#8220;Joke&#8221; quartet, is the most celebrated of the set. The nickname &#8220;Joke&#8221; is believed to have originated from the final movement, which incorporates a series of playful musical jokes, such as a mock conclusion and an unexpected outburst of powerful chords, which leave the listener with a feeling of joyful surprise.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="716" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-716x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1302" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-716x1024.png 716w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-210x300.png 210w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-300x429.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40-640x915.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.09.40.png 747w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" /></figure>



<p>Comprising four movements, the piece follows a a non-traditional structure. The first movement is composed in Sonata form, while the second, instead of being a Minuet and Trio, is a Scherzo and Trio. The third and fourth movements are both arranged as a Rondo.</p>



<p>The quartet opens with a delightful theme that is subsequently fragmented, manipulated, and reassembled in various ways. Personally, I found this movement to be lighthearted and fascinating, particularly as Haydn deftly plays with the theme, departing from and returning to it, as demonstrated in the following example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="713" height="517" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.43.45.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1303" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.43.45.png 713w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.43.45-300x218.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.43.45-640x464.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></figure>



<p>The second movement caught my attention with the violin slides present in the Trio section. The movement has a dance-like quality to it, with the second violin intermittently interacting with the first violin. At the same time, the viola and cello provide a steady foundation for the piece.</p>



<p>The third movement presents a stark contrast, opening with the lower strings and at a slower tempo in a Largo style. I found the movement to be somewhat dramatic, particularly with the powerful forte chords played by all strings. An illustration of this effect is evident in the following example towards the end of the movement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="453" height="295" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.57.43.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1307" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.57.43.png 453w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-11.57.43-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></figure>



<p>The Rondo in the fourth movement shows a catchy, memorable theme that is both danceable and owns a humorous character. The coda segment of the movement is surprising, as the expected recurrence of the theme is subject to hesitant pauses, creating a sense of suspense and uncertainty for the listener. The final pause builds a sense of anticipation, ultimately ending with a soft whisper that leaves the listener with an unresolved sense of closure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Voiles,&#8221; meaning &#8220;sails&#8221; or &#8220;veils,&#8221; gave me the impression of a connection to the wind. As I listened to it, the gentle, ethereal quality of the music immediately brought to mind the iconic Plastic Bag scene from the film &#8220;American Beauty.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="AMERICAN BEAUTY ~ Plastic Bag Scene [HD]" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qssvnjj5Moo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>After re-watching the scene, I believe the composer, Thomas Newman, was inspired by Debussy&#8217;s &#8220;Voiles&#8221;. There are similarities between the two pieces: both feature motifs that move in parallel chords, with an unresolved melodicism and a persistent pedal point running throughout.</p>



<p>While &#8220;Voiles&#8221; evokes a sense of wind, it also carries a certain air of mystery, which can be attributed to the concept of veils. The pervasive use of the whole-tone scale throughout the piece may contribute to this enigmatic quality, adding to the overall impression of ambiguity and uncertainty.</p>



<p>In the opening of the prelude, Debussy builds a small melodic motif around a whole-tone scale harmonized by intervals of a 3rd and 4th, with the pedal note B-flat providing a sense of grounding that will persist throughout almost every bar of the piece. In a way, it seems as though the piece doesn&#8217;t really go anywhere &#8211; it lacks a clear direction or purpose, much like a veil (or a plastic bag) caught in the wind. It simply floats and drifts, carried along by the shifting currents of the melody.</p>



<p>Debussy repeats and develops the initial motif throughout the piece until he eventually suspends the pedal and introduces a new melodic element &#8211; a minor pentatonic scale in E-flat &#8211; as a response and a closing of the development. This section feels like a release from the constraint of the previous material and is perhaps the most exciting part of the piece. However, it doesn&#8217;t last long, and soon the melody returns to its drifting, aimless quality, leaving the listener with a sense of unresolved tension and mystery.</p>



<p>The main whole-tone section returns after just a few bars, and with it comes the sensation of floating, only now with some runs that add a bit of movement to the melody. There&#8217;s a sense that the piece is building towards a climax, with a cadence perhaps just around the corner &#8211; but it never arrives. The floating feeling persists all the way to the end, leaving the listener with a sense of lingering uncertainty and an unfulfilled sense of resolution.</p>



<p>Especially in the first few pages of the score, I can sense a clear counterpoint between the voices, such as the use of contrary motion in this example, as well as a sense of distinct rhythms between them.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The history of the modes goes back to ancient Greece when they used different scale systems to divide&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The history of the modes goes back to ancient Greece when they used different scale systems to divide the octave and named them after territories of Greece and around. The Christian church, around 750 AD, developed seven different scale patterns called Gregorian chant, and gave them the names of the Greek modes, without worrying about their similarities. By 1700, most music used only two of the seven modes, which became known as the major and minor keys. In modern music, modes are less commonly used than major or minor keys, but they can also be found in folk, jazz, classical, and pop music (Powell, 2011).</p>



<p>The seven Greek modes are:</p>



<ol>
<li>Ionian (also known as the major scale)</li>



<li>Dorian</li>



<li>Phrygian</li>



<li>Lydian</li>



<li>Mixolydian</li>



<li>Aeolian (also known as the natural minor scale)</li>



<li>Locrian</li>
</ol>



<p>Each mode consists of a set pattern of tones and semitones derived from the W-W-H-W-W-W-H pattern from the major scale as we can see from the example below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="803" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-803x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1259" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-803x1024.png 803w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-235x300.png 235w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-768x980.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-300x383.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-640x817.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57-960x1225.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-12.26.57.png 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The seven European heptatonic diatonic &#8220;church&#8221; modes (Tagg,2014)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The most interesting aspect to me is understanding why should a composer use such modes. The straight answer is to give the composer more emotional options than the standard major and minor dichotomy. With modes, is as if the composer is able to introduce, even briefly, a new colour or flavour to convey a specific mood or emotion.</p>



<p>I found Tagg&#8217;s (2014) explanation of which traits each mode has, very helpful.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ionian</strong>: is the most common mode in western music and its intervals are the most comfortable to the regular western listener. Music in Ionian mode tends to be happy and bright with examples such as national anthems (God Save The Queen, The Star-Spangled Banner), Happy Birthday or Jingle Bells.</li>



<li><strong>Dorian</strong>: after the Ionian and Aeolian, this is the most common mode mostly because of its similarity with the natural minor (except for the raised sixth in Dorian). Its distinctiveness comes from the combination of minor 3rd and 7th and major 6th. In order to sound Dorian, one must use the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 6th which lends the music a melancholic yet optimistic sound.</li>



<li><strong>Phrygian: </strong>this is the only mode that has a minor 2nd and a perfect 5th and it&#8217;s commonly used in Flamenco. Being a minor mode, it has a darker feel than the Aeolian because of the minor 2nd and has been used by the heavy metal genre to convey a mysterious and &#8220;doom&#8221; feeling, such as in Wherever I May Roam by Metallica.</li>



<li><strong>Lydian:</strong> this mode is just like Ionian but it has a raised 4th which lends the scale an airy, floating and happier sound than Ionian. Film composers tend to adopt this mode for cheerful tunes, John WIlliams one of its main adepts using it in themes such as ET and Back to the Future.</li>



<li><strong>Mixolodyan:</strong> similar to Ionian but with a flattened 7th is characteristic for having a lack of leading tone, which makes it sound smoother than a major scale. It is commonly used in traditional songs from England and Ireland, as well as tunes from Northeastern Brazil, such as Forró. It is also used in rock guitar solos since the flattened 7th exists in the 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th chords.</li>



<li><strong>Aeolian:</strong> is the same as a natural minor scale and its characteristic sound comes from the positioning of its two semitones &#8211; between the 2nd and 3rd, and the 5th and 6th. The repetition of these intervals is perceived as conveying grief, pain or misery. It can be heard in Chopin&#8217;s Marche Funebre as well as Nirvana&#8217;s Smells Like Teen Spirit.</li>



<li><strong>Locrian: </strong>is the least used mode because of its lack of a perfect fifth and a presence of a tritone between the 1st and 5th. It is extremely dissonant and unstable with an extreme tension that lends it a dark mood. It&#8217;s hard to find examples of songs using this mode, but Björk&#8217;s Army Of Me is one of the few examples that keep appearing.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Claude Debussy&#8217;s &#8220;Prélude à l&#8217;après-midi d&#8217;un faune&#8221; is a musical composition that is based on the poem &#8220;L’après-midi d’un faune&#8221; Stéphane Mallarmé. The poem tells the story of a faun, a mythical creature who is half-man and half-goat, as he wakes up from a nap in the forest and is overwhelmed by lustful desires towards nymphs. </p>



<p>This bucolic poem represented a historic milestone of literary symbolism. It places emphasis on the stimuli surrounding the action, rather than the action itself. This creates a reality that is diffuse, with a stronger focus on perception than representation. Is the faun dreaming? Or is all that real? The reader never knows. What is true is that the poem is full of ambiguity and musicality, taking advantage of the French language and its nuances: colour, vowels, and diphthongs. Mallarmé followed the French belief of that time: &#8220;how you say something is as important as what you say: style (timbre) is as important as substance (pitch and rhythm)&#8221; (Greenberg, 2013).</p>



<p>Debussy&#8217;s &#8220;Prélude à l&#8217;après-midi d&#8217;un faune,&#8221; composed between 1892 and 1894, is a musical reflection of the elusive ambiguity present in Mallarmé&#8217;s poem. The fluid rhythms and tonal uncertainties of Debussy&#8217;s composition effectively capture the hazy, indistinct quality of Mallarmé&#8217;s writing.</p>



<p>I believe it cannot be considered a symphonic poem, as it does not adhere to a narrative or a formal structure based on the exposition-development-recapitulation sequence. Instead, it flows freely, mimicking the emotions of its titular character. This free-form approach was a wise decision, as it keeps the listener engaged and constantly surprised. With each listening, one is never quite certain where the music is headed, making for a captivating and unpredictable musical experience.</p>



<p>Starting from the famous opening flute melody, which has an emphasis on the tritone (the ambiguous interval), followed by the horns and soft harp glissandos, set a dreamy and soft awaking tone that resembles the opening of the poem.</p>



<p>One of the most intriguing parts for me starts in bar 17, where the oboe and clarinet produce a sensual and exotic sound. They are then joined by the full orchestra before the clarinet is left to play alone. To me, it feels like the sound of the wind, a whisper, or a call. The repetition of the orchestra adds depth and enhances the overall effect, making this part truly captivating.</p>

<p>Debussy, in my opinion, uses all the sounds and timbres at his disposal to convey the emotions he perceives in Mallarmé&#8217;s poem. He does not follow a specific structure or formal harmonic progression or even tries to follow the story of the poem. Instead, he uses the music as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself, being effective in evoking senses beyond the earthly and capable of creating a fantastical and almost hypnotic musical experience. </p>



<p>This approach aligns with the principles of impressionist painters and symbolist poets who were more concerned with evoking emotions through their work, rather than simply creating a realistic representation. This shift in perspective paved the way for the development of modern art as we know it today.</p>

<p>During my research on Debussy, I discovered that he and Stravinsky were close friends. Following Debussy&#8217;s death, Stravinsky paid tribute by composing a serene chorale, which was later incorporated into the &#8220;Symphonies of Wind Instruments&#8221; in 1920. In 1945, Stravinsky revised the work, publishing it in 1947, and made alterations including the removal of the alto flute and alto clarinet, as well as reworking the musical score.</p>



<p>After listening to it the first time, I absolutely loved this piece. I keep finding Stravinsky&#8217;s work amazing and it&#8217;s one of the composers I most like to listen to, but at the same time is the one I find most difficult to analyze. In the next paragraphs I&#8217;ll try to understand what made me like this piece.</p>



<p>The first hint comes from the title. The &#8220;Symphonies of Wind Instruments&#8221; is a musical work with a title that alludes to the original definition of symphony (as opposed to the musical form) as a harmonious blending of instruments. That&#8217;s one of the characteristics of this piece that stroke me right away. The interplay between the different wind instruments, particularly in terms of the contrasting chromatic tones between the woodwinds and brass, is particularly striking. Stravinsky&#8217;s manipulation of the instruments, such as in bar 3 where he plays a Bb in the trumpet and a B in the clarinets, creates a unique sonic landscape that highlights the tonal differences between the instruments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="774" height="900" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1243" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41.png 774w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41-258x300.png 258w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41-768x893.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41-300x349.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-13.33.41-640x744.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /></figure>



<p>The formal structure of the piece proves to be elusive and challenging to categorize. It frequently alternates between tempos, including 144, 108, and 72 beats per minute, which are related by a ratio of 2:3:4. The fluctuating time signature only adds to the impression of multiple distinct musical ideas being woven together in the composition.</p>



<p>From the beginning, Stravinsky introduces contrasting thematic materials, switching between joyful flutes, mournful full chords, and the chorale theme, which symbolizes Debussy&#8217;s death or funeral. Throughout the piece, there is no clear narrative or progression. The musical ideas seem to shift abruptly, giving the impression of a series of disconnected fragments.</p>



<p>The chorale theme, which recurs throughout the piece, serves as a unifying thread and provides the piece with a sense of direction. It becomes the focus of the conclusion, which is joyful and uplifting, spreading a sense of peace and resolution.</p>



<p> </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a significant transformation in society as a result of rapid advancements in science and technology. The invention of new forms of communication led to a change in perceptions of time, space and distance. All these frenetic changes paved the way for new ideas, new perceptions and a new ability to process art that led artists to completely break with the old ways of doing art and start thinking about how they can be relevant in a constant-changing world.</p>



<p>Beyond the hyper expressivity and the “abortive gesture” &#8211; doing the “wrong” thing for the “right” expressive reason &#8211; there were technological advances in materials such as recordings or new canvas that allowed artists to explore their expressions outside.</p>



<p>It was in this context that two styles emerged: impressionism and symbolism.</p>



<p>The Impressionist movement in art sought to capture the reality of the modern world, taking inspiration from the realism of Gustave Courbet. The movement was characterized by its emphasis on capturing the fleeting and ephemeral aspects of light and colour in outdoor environments, diverging from the established tradition of creating posed and historical compositions in a studio setting.</p>



<p>The term &#8220;Impressionism&#8221; as a label for the movement gained widespread recognition following the criticism by Louis Leroy of Claude Monet&#8217;s &#8220;Impression, Sunrise&#8221; (Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris) in 1874, which he disparagingly referred to as a mere &#8220;impression&#8221;.</p>



<p>The chief exponents of Impressionism were Paris-based and include Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas in visual arts and Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel in music.</p>



<p>In contrast, the Symbolist movement was characterized by the use of symbols and imagery to express deeper, abstract concepts and emotions. The movement was influenced by the ideas of Charles Baudelaire and other Symbolist poets, who sought to evoke a deeper meaning beyond the literal representation of objects or scenes in their works.</p>



<p>Prominent Symbolists, such as Paul Gauguin, James Whistler, Gustave Moreau, and Odilon Redon, utilized this approach to explore themes such as spirituality, the unconscious, and the imagination.</p>



<p>But in the end, both Impressionists and Symbolists shared a motivation to represent the ephemeral and emotional elements of experience, in order to facilitate the expression of the artist&#8217;s feelings. These movements disrupted conventional modes of artistic expression and established avenues for subsequent art movements, be it through visual arts, poetry, or music.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I approached this assignment by first thinking about the piece&#8217;s structure, drawing inspiration from Bach&#8217;s violin sonata. I&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I approached this assignment by first thinking about the piece&#8217;s structure, drawing inspiration from Bach&#8217;s violin sonata. I researched various baroque dances, such as the Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, and Gigue, and decided to use the Allemande as a primary inspiration because of its 4/4 meter and binary form. After going through the chords several times, I decided to make my piece in binary form as well: the first section from bar 1 to bar 16 and the second from bar 17 to bar 33.</p>



<p>I chose the first section to be 16 bars long, as this is a common length for the first section of dances like Allemande and Bach&#8217;s sonata. Additionally, the perfect cadence from bar 15 (C major) to bar 16 (F major) and the transition from F major to Bb major in bar 17 made it a logical choice. The presence of rehearsal letters also hinted that there would be a break in this section.</p>



<p>As soon as I determined the structure of my composition, <a href="./../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../listening-to-bach-sonata-no-4-for-violin-and-harpsichord-in-c-minor-bmv-1017-1-siciliano/index.html" target="_blank">I reviewed my previous analysis of Bach&#8217;s violin sonata to better understand his techniques</a>. </p>



<p>My composition plan was to introduce the main theme of the sonata in the first bars and then explore it with repetitions and variations until the end of the A section. The B section would start with a similar theme, but with some slight changes to keep it fresh and then move to the main theme until the end of the piece.</p>



<p>One of the challenges I faced right at the beginning of the composition was finding the right rhythms and notes. I tried several combinations and ideas but I ended up feeling that they didn&#8217;t match the Baroque style I was aiming for. Either sounded too simple or too uninteresting. My solution was to borrow material from my previous exercise, which was based on Bach&#8217;s Sonata for Viola da Gamba &amp; Harpsichord in G Minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="676" height="242" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1165" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13.png 676w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-300x107.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-24-at-16.02.13-640x229.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Exercise 3.4 theme</figcaption></figure>



<p>But even after finding a theme, I wasn&#8217;t satisfied with how it sounded in the first four bars, so I decided to begin it at rehearsal mark A (bar 5) and develop it from there. Overall, I was pleased with how the melody turned out and specifically enjoyed applying the lessons I learned from Bach by allowing the C# in bar 8 to move to bar 9 instead of resolving to D.</p>



<p>There was a challenge with the first 4 bars since I lacked ideas as to what to do in order to make them interesting. My solution was to write an introduction that hinted at the main theme&#8217;s rhythm, as a preview of what was to come. Despite not being able to find out whether an introduction was common to the Baroque style, I decided to include it since it made sense in this composition.</p>



<p>My goal in the B section was to make the violin sound freer, but not totally different from the previous section. In order to achieve this, I kept the tied note and the three descending notes from the main theme.</p>



<p>The next step was ornamenting the violin and the treble harpsichord. I looked into Taylor (1998), Apel (1969) and Bach (1949) for guidance and kept in mind that Bach used ornamentations at the perfect timing. The main difficulty I faced was understanding how to write the first and final notes on the trills regarding the previous and the next note. For example, in bars 2 and 12, the previous note is the same upper note of the trill. Should the player play it two times or make it tied? I couldn&#8217;t find a definitive answer but it made sense to me to be tied.</p>

<p>In bars 29 and 30, I decided to incorporate a suspiran, which is a technique I learned from an article by Peter Williams (1979).</p>

<p>Overall, I am pleased with how I was able to incorporate elements from Bach&#8217;s sonata into my composition, but I am aware that it may not sound as authentically Baroque as it could. Sometimes it sounds too contemporary. Possibly the pivotal question is this: How can we write in the style of a specific era if we have been influenced by later ones? This may be a constant challenge that composers face, and it&#8217;s something that I kept in mind throughout the composition process. Despite this, I am happy with the final result and how it captures the essence of the Baroque style while incorporating my own creative choices.</p>

<p>Vivaldi Recomposed, composed by the British composer Max Richter and performed by the Konzerthaus Kammerorchester Berlin, is a reinterpretation of Antonio Vivaldi&#8217;s iconic Four Seasons. Richter, known for his unique blend of classical and contemporary music, masterfully weaves themes and ideas from the original composition and adds his modern touch to create a fresh and exciting listening experience.</p>



<p>When I first heard about Vivaldi Recomposed, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder why a composer would take on such a bold and daring task. After all, the Four Seasons is considered a masterpiece, so why would anyone want to tamper with it? But Richter&#8217;s response to this question was simple and illuminating: &#8220;It&#8217;s just everywhere. In a way, we stop being able to hear it.&#8221; (Service, 2017). And with that, it all made sense. The Four Seasons has become so ubiquitous that it has become background noise. I prefer to look at this work as a wake-up call or a provocation to think about something you take for granted.</p>



<p>After listening to it more than once, a few elements caught my attention. First and foremost, Richter&#8217;s work is not an arrangement of the original piece, but an entirely reimagined interpretation based on Vivaldi&#8217;s core. This became clear to me when my 5-year-old daughter began whistling like a bird when I listened to the Spring movement. Richter effectively conveyed the birds singing as Vivaldi intended, but in a creative and innovative way.</p>



<p>Another aspect that caught my attention was the simplicity and repetition of the movements. I don&#8217;t see it as superior or inferior to Vivaldi&#8217;s original, but a reflection of modern aesthetics valuing repetition over baroque flamboyance, and Richter&#8217;s style emphasizing prolonged notes played over repetitive themes (e.g. Infra 8).</p>



<p>Additionally, the use of synthesizers in the piece was particularly interesting to me, as they were used not to over-modernize the soundscape, but rather as a hint of modernity that amplified the range of sounds and added depth to the strings.</p>



<p>I can rephrase the initial &#8220;Why?&#8221; to &#8220;Should?&#8221; I believe the answer is yes, composers like Richter should continue creating recomposed works, <a href="./../../../listening-to-boris-blacher-variations-on-a-theme-of-paganini/index.html" data-type="post" data-id="135" target="_blank">as I previously observed</a>.</p>



<p>I believe music is a living and organic force, not a static one. The reason for this is that musical instruments evolved, tuning evolved, and players evolved. Therefore, the way we hear these compositions today doesn&#8217;t sound the way they did when previous composers such as Vivaldi composed them. By reimagining these works, we not only pay tribute to the greats of the past but also ensure that music lives on for generations to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Reading &#8220;How to Listen to Great Music&#8221; by Robert Greenberg has been an invaluable resource in learning how to listen to and analyze music. The author suggests listening to Bach&#8217;s Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 as a way to gain a deeper understanding of Baroque concertos, with a particular emphasis on the ritornello. The concerto, which is composed for flute, solo violin, harpsichord, and strings, presents several interesting features upon listening and studying the score.</p>



<p>Right from the start of the concerto, I noticed the ritornello theme, which was highlighted by Greenberg, and how it reappears in fragments throughout the movement before being repeated in the end after the harpsichord solo.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="547" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-1024x547.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1209" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-1024x547.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-300x160.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-768x410.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-640x342.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29-960x513.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.05.29.png 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ritornello Theme</figcaption></figure>



<p>As Greenberg explains in his book, the function of the ritornello theme is to create a sense of logical inevitability, providing a feeling of returning home and familiarity, even if only for a brief moment. This helps the listener relax and not be overwhelmed by constant new sounds.</p>



<p>It works similarly to a chorus in modern-day popular music. but it typically appears at the beginning and end of the movement, while choruses in contemporary music typically appear in the middle and end of songs. I am curious as to why composers have shifted the placement of this familiar theme from the beginning to the middle of their compositions.</p>



<p>The concerto is also notable for its use of the harpsichord as a solo instrument. The harpsichord, which was a relatively new instrument at the time, was often used as a continuo instrument to accompany other instruments. However, in this concerto, according to Greenberg, Bach was the first to elevate the harpsichord to the role of a true solo instrument, giving it an equal voice alongside the flute and violin. And this solo is extremely impressive and virtuoso.</p>



<p>This movement also stands out for its unique use of the harpsichord as a solo instrument. While it was often used as a continuo instrument in the past, Bach elevated its role to that of a true solo instrument, giving it equal importance alongside the flute and violin. According to Greenberg, this concerto marks a significant moment in music history as the harpsichord&#8217;s solo capabilities were truly showcased for the first time. </p>



<p>The second movement of the concerto is an affettuoso, characterized by its melodic singing between the flute and violin. As I listened, I noticed two features that I had previously encountered in Bach&#8217;s violin sonata &#8211; the use of long, melodic lines that persistently avoid resolving to a steady cadence (as exemplified by the flute&#8217;s quick movement to C), and the repetition of a rhythmic pattern (in this case, quaver-quaver-dotted semiquaver-demisemiquaver) throughout the entire movement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.20.07.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1210" width="445" height="304" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.20.07.png 738w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.20.07-300x205.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-27-at-14.20.07-640x437.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" /></figure>



<p>The third movement starts with the exposition of a fugal theme by the violin, which is then repeated by the flute. However, as the movement progresses, the violin and flute often play in unison, rather than in counterpoint as is typical in a true fugue. Despite this, there is a significant use of polyphonic texture throughout the movement.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="Glenn Gould &amp; Yehudi Menuhin - Bach, Sonata No. 4 in C minor (OFFICIAL)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Boii0EA6hWo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>This sonata looks like a good example of Baroque music, characterized by its long melodic lines and ornamental elements. Upon listening to it for the first time played by Glenn Gould and Yehudi Menuhin, I feel that there&#8217;s an interesting contrast between the smoothness of the violin and the pointed, moving accompaniment of the harpsichord. After listening to it several times and studying the score, I noticed several unique features.</p>



<p>One of the key observations I made was that the harpsichord had a repetitive pattern, which allowed the violin to take centre stage. The bass harpsichord usually played a continuous arpeggio starting on the downbeat, while the treble harpsichord had an upward and downward motion with its highest note on the second note of the violin rhythm. The violin melody, in section A, seemed to be a long single melody that lasted 16 bars. Although I could definitely hear that the melody line didn&#8217;t settle until bar 16 and it seemed like Bach avoided a cadence in bars 8 and 12, I was unsure of how he achieved this effect. But my tutor helped clarify that it was a mixture of harmony, not having a perfect cadence, melody/rhythm notes that cross bars, and the use of weaker inversions of chords that gave a feeling of movement instead of a final rest. I hadn&#8217;t thought about how inverting chords could transmit a sense movement and it made much more sense to me after his answer.</p>



<p>Another observation I made was the rhythm of the violin melody and its repetition. This movement of the sonata is a Siciliano which is a musical style from the baroque era, usually in a slow 6/8 time and in a minor key. The violin follows the traditional Siciliana rhythms with a dotted quaver &#8211; semiquaver &#8211; quaver. It&#8217;s interesting to notice that Bach uses this exact rhythm 36 times and some of its variations throughout this movement but without making it feel repetitive. The use of ornamentation is essential here.</p>

<p>Overall, I find this piece to be deceptively simple yet incredibly evocative and emotionally charged. Reflecting on its various features has helped me gain a deeper understanding of how to approach my assignment with greater insight and understanding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The exercise proved to be more challenging than anticipated. I began by creating the chords as outlined in the instructions, which was enjoyable and entertaining. It took some time to figure out the different melodic lines and determine whether, for example, the bass should move upward or downward from bar 1 to bar 2. Ultimately, I ended up with more dynamic lines in the Tenor and Bass compared to the Soprano and Alto, which appeared to be a bit static.</p>



<p>The most challenging aspect for me was developing the melodic lines. I found that the Tenor and Bass lines were easier to work with and changing them added an interesting rhythm to the phrase. In beat 3 of bar 1, I added a passing note to the Tenor to shorten the leap. In bar 3, I continued to add quavers to the Tenor and Bass to maintain a similar rhythm as the first part.</p>



<p>Upon examining Bach’s harmonization, I noticed that the main difference was that he added much more interest to bar 4, particularly with the descending Tenor.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[During my research, I discovered that Bach is well-known for his prolific composition of cantatas, both secular and&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During my research, I discovered that Bach is well-known for his prolific composition of cantatas, both secular and sacred. He developed the &#8220;chorale cantata&#8221; style and at his most productive, he composed one cantata per week for eight years. Between 1723 and 1729, Bach completed four yearly cycles consisting of about 60 cantatas each (Greer, 2002).</p>



<p>&#8220;Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140&#8221; is one of his most famous cantatas which relates the story from Matthew 25:1-13, about the ten virgins waiting for the arrival of the bridegroom (Christ).</p>



<p>This Cantata follows a symmetrical structure where it includes a chorale in the middle movement and is framed by two sets of recitative-aria movements. The cantata begins and ends with chorale-choruses, which I found to be a common feature in Bach’s compositions.</p>



<p>After listening to the cantata three times (without score, with score and after my research), I found it to be a dramatic and theatrical piece, but even more impressive when I learned about the context in which it was performed in a church setting.</p>



<p>For example, in the first movement, the retornello in the first 4 bars reminded me of a wedding and it was only after my research that I found out that the setting of this movement is the calling of all Jerusalem to prepare for a wedding feast. Another example of the dramatism is how the voices of this first movement don’t start singing together, but arrive one by one, as if they are arriving to the event.</p>

<p>The uplifting feeling in the first movement comes from the serene instrumentation combined with the uplifting lines of the chorale.</p>

<p>I found the second movement to be like a narrator, with the Tenor voice, moving the story forward in the. The third movement is a dialogue between the Soul (Soprano) and Jesus (Bass) and in the fourth movement, I found the conjunction of a simple melody line of the tenor with a danceable string melody supported by the continuos movement of the continuo very pleasing. </p>



<p>The seventh movement, the last choral part, is a hymn so that all the congregation can join and sing in a final movement. That&#8217;s why the soprano sings the melody and the other voices fill in the harmony.</p>



<p>I found listening to Cantata No. 140 by Bach enjoyable, but it was more enriching to understand the meaning and context of the composition. At first, I didn&#8217;t fully grasp the nuances and constructions Bach made, but by learning more about cantatas and their role in bringing people together in a church setting, I was able to appreciate it more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The exercise proved to be more complex and time-consuming than anticipated. I began by creating the bass line, using a continuous quaver pattern like Bach does in the sonata I was studying. However, I decided to make the line ascend and descend in all bars except for bar 3. Then, I moved on to the treble line where I attempted to imitate Bach&#8217;s repetitive style but found it lacking interest. To add some variety, I incorporated some rhythm borrowed from Bach&#8217;s Sonata for Viola da Gamba &amp; Harpsichord in G Minor. Finally, I wrote the melody, which proved to be challenging due to the prominent harpsichord treble line. I found myself questioning if that&#8217;s why Bach kept it repetitive. Despite this, I completed the violin melody, complementing the harpsichord.</p>



<p>In regards to cadence, I tried to leave it unresolved, similar to Bach in his sonata but found that the unresolved cadence is more prominent in the harpsichord line than the violin.</p>



<p>In the end, I was not entirely satisfied with the violin melody. I believe it needs to be made more distinct and not so closely tied to the harpsichord.</p>



<p></p>

<p>After closely analyzing Bach&#8217;s piece, I gained a deeper understanding of the movement of chords, particularly the bass line. I observed how skillfully he transitioned from the C minor scale to the G major. This prompted me to redo the exercise, attempting to replicate Bach&#8217;s approach on the harpsichord more closely.</p>



<p>To my surprise, the exercise seemed simpler this time around. Whether it was due to having done it previously or my increasing knowledge of Bach&#8217;s writing, I am not sure. I transferred my original harpsichord treble line to the violin and wrote the harpsichord lines afterwards.</p>



<p>Overall, I was quite pleased with the outcome of my second attempt. The piece appeared more cohesive, with the violin melody standing out without constant competition from the other lines.</p>

<p>Although I appreciate pop music, I&#8217;m usually turned away from songs that are too popular on the charts. But, when I stumbled upon SZA&#8217;s &#8220;Kill Bill&#8221; on the radio without knowing what it was, I was extremely surprised. The song really caught my attention. My impression was that the song never settled down, a feeling (a very good feeling) I also had when <a href="./../../../listening-to-beach-boys-god-only-knows/index.html" data-type="post" data-id="531" target="_blank">listening to God Only Knows</a>.</p>



<p>The aspect that impressed me the most was the chorus vocal melody. It was straightforward yet stunning and flowed smoothly. Upon transcribing it, I discovered the song was in Ab Major, but the vocal melody only utilized the Ab once on the last note of the 4th beat, which was a rather weak one. There was also an A flat, a chromatic note just a half-step from the tonic, leading to a sense of uncertainty and incompletion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="74" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1024x74.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1222" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1024x74.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-300x22.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-768x55.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-1536x111.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-2048x148.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-640x46.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26-960x69.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-30-at-12.30.26.png 2578w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The chord progression also caught my attention. Throughout the song, it used the same progression: Bbm-Eb-Ab-F or ii-V-I-VI. This again contributed to a sense of instability as it started on ii and placed the I on the third bar, which is a weaker position for establishing the key. The final chord was a modulation to a chromatic chord of F Major, which was my favourite part of the chorus. It was playful, and daring, and complemented the lyrics perfectly (e.g. &#8220;Rather be in jail than alone&#8221;).</p>



<p>But right from the beginning, the song starts off sounding vague. There&#8217;s a distinct out-of-tune waver that is completely undefined. From that point, the song could head in any direction. Then, the drum beat enters and as with any typical pop song, you anticipate listening to a four-beat loop until the vocals begin. But the vocals come in on the fourth beat, like an anacrusis, unexpectedly.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I don&#8217;t think &#8220;Kill Bill&#8221; will be regarded as a masterpiece like &#8220;God Only Knows,&#8221; but in today&#8217;s landscape of overwhelming similar-sounding pop music, I found the song to be invigorating. I hope it serves as inspiration for other artists to create pop music that departs from standard harmonic and melodic structures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ornamentation was one of the prominent features of the Baroque era and can be loosely described as the practice of embellishing music by adding extra notes and little figures in a very specific style.</p>



<p>Although there is evidence that the ornamentation of melodies goes back to early singers of Gregorian chant, it wasn&#8217;t until the late Renaissance and early Baroque that the ornamentation became stereotyped. It was in France, that the practice of ornamentation in music was standardized under the name &#8220;agréments,&#8221; allowing for the use of signs or abbreviations to indicate them in a score (Apel, 1969).</p>



<p>In order to understand why ornamentation in music was so prominent in the Baroque era, especially the late Baroque, I turned to the article &#8220;Late Baroque Ornamentation: Philosophy and Guideline&#8221; by David Lasocki in which the author details six purposes for the extensive use of these decorative elements during this period.</p>



<p>First, according to the author, it was an essential component of the Baroque aesthetic, emphasising the ornate and decorative. Second, it gave the performer &#8220;an opportunity to demonstrate their judgement, inventiveness, and insight&#8221;. Third, performers had more training and desire to play more than the music exactly as written. Fourth, ornamentation added verve and freshness to the performance through spontaneous recomposition. Fifth, ornamentation helped to create variety in multiple performances of the same work. Finally, it was expected by both performers and audiences, since performers would likely have attempted to use ornamentation in order to please their colleagues and audiences (Lasocki, 1988).</p>



<p>According to Robert Donington in The Interpretation of Early Music, there were more than one hundred and twenty-five signs used in early music, but Victor Rangel-Ribeiro claims that only four were used enough &#8220;to have become characteristic of Baroque music&#8221; (Rangel-Ribeiro, 2016): the appoggiatura (a dissonant note resolving on the weaker beat to the next note above or below), the trill (rapid alternation of the main note with a higher auxiliary note), the mordent (a rapid alternation of the main note with the note immediately below it), and the turn (a decorative flourish consisting of a rapid alternation of the main note with the note above it).</p>



<p>One of the challenges in interpreting Baroque ornamentation is that there was a degree of flexibility and subjectivity in how these ornaments were performed. While composers often provided indications for the use of ornamentation in their scores, they did not always specify exactly how the ornaments should be performed. This left room for interpretation and allowed performers to add their own personal flair and expression to the music.</p>



<p>Composers used various signs to indicate different ornaments, but there was no standardized set of ornamentation symbols. To help clarify which sign was being used for which ornament, some composers included tables of ornaments in their publications starting in the late seventeenth century (Schulenberg, 2001). One of the examples is Bach&#8217;s:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="289" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1130" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png 750w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-300x116.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-640x247.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bach, J.S. and Wolff, C. (2022) <em>Notebook for Wilhelm Friedemann Bach 1720 (Edition Peters) (German Edition)</em>. Alfred Music.</figcaption></figure>



<p>During the period between 1650 and 1750, the practice of writing ornaments as notes in music was considered detrimental to the clarity of the melodic line. J.S. Bach, in particular, was criticized for writing down the ornaments and embellishments that performers were expected to add instinctively. &#8220;He writes down in actual notes the ornaments and embellishments that performers are accustomed to supply instinctively, a habit which not only sacrifices the harmonic beauty of his music but also makes the melody totally indistinct&#8221; (Apel, 1969).</p>



<p>Overall, ornamentation was a central aspect of Baroque music, both in terms of its aesthetic and its performance practice. It was used to add interest, variety, and drama to the music, and was an important part of the composer-performer partnership of the time.</p>

<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been enjoying it more and more the cello. Actually, I think  I&#8217;m particularly drawn to low-pitched instruments like the acoustic bass, bassoon, and cello. When I learned that Schubert wrote a piece for a string quintet with a second cello instead of the usual second viola, I was curious to listen to it.</p>



<p>Listening to it was an emotional journey. The piece seemed to effortlessly shift from one mood to another. For instance, in the first movement (10:03-13:05), it transitioned from a beautiful melodic line to an intense, almost violent cello and back to the melodic line and again back to an angry mood. All this in just 3 minutes.</p>



<p>Sometimes the piece reminded me of Beethoven. For example, at the beginning of the third movement (00:00-04:03), where there is such a strength that it almost looks like an entire orchestra is playing. I think sometimes I could hear a brass instrument within the strings, and it&#8217;s amazing how Schubert was able to create such magic.</p>



<p>I think the decision to use two cellos gave the piece a full orchestral sound, especially during moments with a darker mood, such as the first movement.</p>



<p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this piece and it has sparked my interest in exploring Schubert&#8217;s other works.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As I worked through the exercises, I found that realizing figured bass was more challenging than I initially expected. While I had an understanding of harmony and chord structure, applying this knowledge to the figured bass notation required me to think more critically and pay attention to the specific intervals and chord qualities indicated by the figures.</p>



<p>Despite the initial difficulty, I found that the process of realizing figured bass became easier and more intuitive as I continued to work through the exercises. I enjoyed the process of analyzing the figures and determining the appropriate chords to use in each situation.</p>



<p>One aspect of figured bass that I found particularly appealing was the way it allows for a balance between structure and creativity. As with the counterpoint rules we studied before, there are certain conventions to follow, but there is still room to make choices. While the basic harmonic structure is provided by the figured bass symbols, the performer is given the freedom to interpret and realize those chords in a way that fits the musical context and their own artistic vision.</p>



<p>Overall, I found the process of realizing figured bass to be both challenging and rewarding. While it may not be a technique that I would use in my own music-making (does any composer use it today? I couldn&#8217;t find an answer), I can see how it could be a useful tool for composers and players in order to keep everyone on the same register. Additionally, I believe that the process of realizing figured bass has helped me to deepen my understanding of harmony and chord structure, which will undoubtedly be beneficial in my future musical endeavours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are many different ways in which instruments can be tuned, and the method used has varied throughout history and across different cultures. In Western classical music, the most commonly used tuning system is equal temperament (more specifically the 12-tone equal temperament), in which each note is separated from the next by a fixed interval known as a semitone. This system allows for the easy transposition of music and the ability to play in any key, but can sometimes result in less pure-sounding intervals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-1120" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38.jpeg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-300x225.jpeg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-768x576.jpeg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-640x480.jpeg 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/slide_38-960x720.jpeg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Before the widespread use of equal temperament, other tuning systems were commonly employed. Pythagoras, in the 6th century BC, developed a tuning system based on perfect fifths with a 3:2 ratio. This system, known as Pythagorean tuning, is a form of Just Intonation that preserves the pure sound of fifths but has the drawback of producing out-of-tune thirds, which were not commonly used before the Renaissance. To address this issue, just temperament was developed.</p>



<p>During the Renaissance, the Meantone system of tuning was developed as musicians searched for new ways to experiment with tonality and harmony. It differed from the Pythagorean system in that it focused on the major third rather than the root and fifth, enabling the creation of more harmonious melodies by making dissonant notes more in tune. This system also introduced its own dissonances, known as wolf intervals.</p>



<p>In the Meantone temperament, the octave can be divided into more than 12 pitches, producing distinct pitches for notes like G♯ and A♭. Some keyboard instruments were designed to accommodate these additional pitches.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>During the Baroque era, &#8220;well-tempered&#8221; systems became popular. These tuning systems slightly adjust the intervals between the pitches of an instrument to optimize its performance in a specific key or range of keys. The tunings of the notes are not perfectly aligned with a particular scale, like equal temperament, but rather are adjusted to produce more pleasant melodies and harmonies in a particular key or set of keys. This allows for greater flexibility and expressiveness in music, as different keys can have their own unique tonal characteristics.</p>



<p>In the early 20th century, Czech composer Alois Hába introduced microtonal music, a new tuning system featuring intervals smaller than a semitone. This system allows for more complex and interesting harmonies, but requires specialized instruments and can be challenging for musicians trained in equal temperament to play.</p>



<p>This is just a brief overview of Western tuning systems. In other parts of the world, other systems have been used. For instance, Indian classical music frequently employs just intonation, with the addition of shruti, intervals smaller than those normally found between notes, similar to cents in Western music (<em>Microtones in Indian Classical Music</em>, no date). In the modern Arab tone system, the octave is divided into 24 equal intervals known as quarter tones. The specific notes used in a piece belong to one of more than seventy modes or maqam rows.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This turned out harder than I thought. The process of writing the numbers of the figured bass is slower than realising the figured bass. After checking against the solution, I realised I made several mistakes as shown below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="254" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-1024x254.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1104" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-1024x254.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-300x74.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-768x191.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-1536x381.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-2048x508.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-640x159.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1-960x238.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-1.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">First attempt</figcaption></figure>



<p>I forgot the F# in the first bar and missed the 4+. Strangely, bar 3 has the same first chord, but I added a # to it. Clearly, there was a lack of attention.</p>



<p>That first chord in bar 3 is a 7th chord, so the 4+ should replace the lonely #.</p>



<p>Likewise, I forgot to add the b to the Ab chord. As well as the chords in bar 4 where I did not add the accidentals.</p>



<p>There is only one question I have left. The solution did not contain figured bass in the second note in bar 3. How much should be written?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="240" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-1024x240.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1105" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-1024x240.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-768x180.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-1536x360.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-2048x480.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-640x150.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2-960x225.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/exercise-3.2-2.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Correct Figured Bass</figcaption></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This exercise was fun because it allowed me to experiment with different chord voicings and try to incorporate some voice-leading and melodic shapes. As I experimented with different spacings, I noticed that closer chords sounded muddier, whereas spread chords were much sharper and more detailed. I used these spread chords to add punctuation to certain parts of the composition, such as in bar 6.</p>

<p>I recently became a fan of Caroline Shaw after listening to her Partita for 8 Singer. I have since listened to some of her other songs, including &#8220;To the Sky,&#8221; which features Shaw&#8217;s exceptional vocals and the talented musicianship of the exploratory New York ensemble Sō Percussion. The lyrics for the song are taken from Anne Steele&#8217;s 18th-century hymnal, the Sacred Harp.</p>



<p>The song starts off with a gentle hum and softly rumbling marimba, gradually increasing in intensity and culminating in Shaw&#8217;s powerful vocals. Shaw&#8217;s music often showcases a dynamic range and the versatility of the voice as an instrument.</p>



<p>In addition to Shaw&#8217;s vocals, Sō Percussion&#8217;s expert use of percussion instruments creates a rich and complex soundscape that perfectly complements Shaw&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>After a gentle start, the song builds to a climax with exuberance and then fades away, leaving me with a sense of awe and wonder.</p>



<p>Overall, &#8220;To the Sky&#8221; is a beautiful and moving piece of music that has left me wanting to hear more from Shaw.</p>

<p>Because of Project 3.0, I started listening to Händel&#8217;s Dixit Dominus&#8217; first movement and ended up listening to the entire work. </p>



<p>Georg Friedrich Händel was a German-born composer (1685 &#8211; 1759) who worked in Germany, and Italy and settled in London. He was heavily influenced by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition and the Italian Baroque style. Händel&#8217;s music is considered a pinnacle of the &#8220;high baroque&#8221; style and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of his era.</p>



<p>Dixit Dominus is a psalm setting completed in 1707 and is scored for an SSATB choir and soloists, strings and continuo. </p>



<p>Although I enjoyed the entire piece, I found the first movement to be the most interesting and surprising. As a psalm, I was expecting a contemplative and loving sound. Instead, I found it to be rough and even a bit hostile. This was due to the rhythmic vitality which felt a lot like a warlike snare.</p>



<p>It is not surprising that the piece&#8217;s opening movement evokes a warlike sound, given the psalm&#8217;s theme about God giving the king of Israel the power to defeat his enemies (Clássicos dos Clássicos, 2019).</p>



<p>The ending of Dominus a dextris tuis is another example of the power of the choir, as it resembles a war chant. I imagine this would likely have been striking to an audience in the 1700s, given the religious context in which it was performed.</p>



<p>The choir in this piece reminded me of Caroline Shaw&#8217;s Partita for 8 Voices. I believe that they are similar in their exploration of different vocal timbers and ranges, either together or in counterpoint. Additionally, the staccato rhythm of the voices in both pieces creates an almost drum-like feeling.</p>

<p>Richard Strauss (1864-1949), a child prodigy with exceptional musical aptitude, composed two symphonies and concertos for horn and violin by the time he was twenty years of age. He hailed from Munich and was the son of Franz Strauss, a celebrated horn player who held Mozart, Beethoven, and Haydn in high esteem as his &#8220;musical trinity&#8221; (Kennedy, 2006).</p>



<p>In 1874, he attended the Ludwigsgymnasium where he studied music theory with Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer, conductor of the Munich Court Orchestra. During his studies with Meyer, Strauss learned about Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn and other classical composers.</p>



<p>By the time Strauss was 18, he had already written around 150 pieces in a conservative style that resembled Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. But at 21, he began to rebel against this traditional sound.</p>



<p>In 1885, he moved to Meiningen to work with Hans von Bülow, a renowned conductor. He learnt about opera from Brahms and perfected his conducting technique, while being exposed to the two main currents of Germanic music at the time. Those advocating &#8220;pure music&#8221; (e.g., Joachim, Hanslick) hailed Brahms&#8217; music and opposed those who propagated &#8220;music of the future&#8221; (e.g., Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner) (Malheiros dos Santos, 2018).</p>



<p>Strauss met Alexander Ritter (1833-1896), a composer and violinist in the Meiningen Orchestra, who had an immense influence on him. An avid follower of Wagner, Ritterer shifted Strauss&#8217; focus from abstract works towards modern orchestral works inspired by literature. This was despite his father&#8217;s disapproval of Wagner&#8217;s music. In 1889, Strauss completed his first mature masterpiece Don Juan (Dotsey, 2019).</p>



<p>The idea behind composing Don Juan was born in 1885, during a performance of Paul Heyse&#8217;s Don Juans Ende in Frankfurt. However, Strauss&#8217; direct source was an incomplete poem from 1851 written by Nicolaus Lenau. In contrast to the classic conception of Don Juan as a rake and impostor, Lenau portrayed him as an idealist searching for ultimate love, eventually becoming discontented with himself.</p>



<p>In his composition of Don Juan, Strauss focused on the individual pursuit of an idealised form of love that perpetually eludes him. This is expressed musically through a continuous rise and fall in emotion that culminates in the protagonist&#8217;s demise by duel.</p>



<p>Strauss wrote Don Juan for a large instrumental ensemble consisting of 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes and English horn, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons and contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, cymbals, glockenspiel, harp, and strings.</p>



<p>Strauss&#8217; structure of Don Juan mirrors the story told by Nikolaus Lenau, beginning with a presentation of the protagonist, followed by two episodes of love affairs and an orgiastic scene which leads to a duel with Don Pedro resulting in his (assumed) death.</p>



<p>At the outset of this piece, Strauss employs the whole orchestra to create a boisterous, heroic rising pattern which adds vigour and propulsion to the main theme.</p>



<p>The initial scene (beginning at 00:56 of the recording I listened to) appears to be the introduction of Don Juan&#8217;s initial conquest and romantic relationship with a woman. There is a duet between the violins (woman) and horns and cello (Don Juan), that culminates in a very interesting and surprising dark climax at G.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="456" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08-456x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1057" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08-456x1024.png 456w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08-134x300.png 134w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08-300x674.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-05-at-11.51.08.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></figure>



<p>The second scene (at 05:32) appears to be another conquest by Don Juan, suggesting a greater emotional connection this time. The plaintive flute and especially the endearing oboe melody are employed to convey the ardour of his love. This sentiment ultimately reaches a triumphant high point as the horns play the heroic theme.</p>



<p>The carnival scene (at 10:27) functions as a transitional section as it spirals out of control. It starts with tranquil strings, but quickly gains intensity and creates an intense atmosphere. As the scene progresses, Strauss juxtaposes various iterations of Don Juan&#8217;s theme on top of one another.</p>



<p>The fight scene (at 15:00) maintains the tension built in the preceding scene, ending suddenly to echo Don Juan&#8217;s death at the hands of Don Pedro.</p>



<p>The death scene (at 15:37) is an understated and sorrowful conclusion with the bassoons giving Don Juan a final breath.</p>



<p>Listening to the full piece is clear that Strauss uses the full orchestra and its individual timbres to express Don Juan&#8217;s emotional journey to the audience. At the start, he is portrayed as audacious and confident through sweeping arpeggios and complex orchestration. His love stories are tender and romantic, with Strauss employing range, colour and instrumentation to illustrate the character&#8217;s humanity. He accentuates Don Juan&#8217;s boldness through powerful instruments such as brass while utilising woodwinds to depict his insecurities.</p>



<p>Strauss&#8217; use of dynamics is a notable feature in his composition of Don Juan. As an example, it ranges between ff and fff only for woodwinds, horns, and strings in the A. Another example is the beautiful slow movement in L, which ranges from p to ppp. In addition to conveying the storyline to the listener, this creates an interesting contrast that prevents the music from becoming monotonous.</p>



<p>The exact structure of Don Juan has been a source of detective work for the past century, with the piece being described by some as a free sonata and by others as either a rondo or a fusion between the two (Hepokoski, 1997). Nonetheless, it is clear that Strauss wanted to move away from conventional structures.</p>



<p>Romantic-era composers sought more open ways to express their musical ideas, instead of the strict forms used by classical composers (i.e. Haydn&#8217;s sonata form). With this newfound freedom, they could employ melody, harmony and texture to evoke a narrative, a character or an atmosphere; thus new genres such as Programme Music, Concert Overture and Symphonic Poem were created.</p>



<p>In the collection of his thoughts, Recollections and Reflections, edited by biographer Willi Schuh, Strauss voiced his support for these novel orchestral forms. He stated that “New ideas must seek out new forms for themselves: the basic principle adopted by Liszt in his symphonic works, in which the poetic idea really did act simultaneously as the structural element, became from then onwards the guideline for my own symphonic works.” (Strauss and Schuh, 1974).</p>



<p>Strauss was aware of the pioneering progressions in Programme Music from Liszt, a pianist who revolutionised programme music with his novel genre, the symphonic poem.</p>



<p>The term &#8216;symphonic poem&#8217; describes a programmatic work composed for an orchestra which draws inspiration from a range of outside sources, such as poems, stories and artwork. This style of composition was adopted to meet nineteenth-century aesthetic objectives; by relating music to something non-musical, allowing multiple movements to be combined into one section and raising instrumental program music up to the same level as opera (Macdonald, 2001).</p>



<p>In addition, composers of symphonic poems had the freedom to alter the stories and characters, as Strauss appears to do with Don Juan. It remains uncertain whether he is faithful to Lenau&#8217;s representation, or if he uses melodic themes and orchestral colouring to suggest a character who is more actively engaged with life rather than one who is jaded. This could be described as the enchantment of romanticism in art, expressed by their search for unlimited possibilities in composition which allows listeners to enter into a realm of introspection and imagination rather than being restricted by form.</p>



<p>Strauss also drew much influence from Wagner, particularly in terms of chromaticism, harmonic structures, and the use of leitmotifs. In his composition of Don Juan, this is evident through the varied orchestration and gradual evolution of motifs to evoke drama and emotion. These musical ideas effectively convey the psychological nature of its characters.</p>



<p>It wasn’t just the piece’s structure and the use of the motifs that made Don Juan innovative. The piece demands great technical virtuosity from its performers in terms of range, breath control and virtuosic execution, as in A. This is emblematic of the Romantic era which sought to develop great technical virtuosity.</p>

<p>In summary, Richard Strauss&#8217;s Don Juan is a remarkable example of Program Music from the Romantic era. It displays his aptitude in utilizing various musical elements to convey the protagonist’s inner world whilst simultaneously stirring emotions in its listeners. Through the incorporation of leitmotifs, chromaticism and technically challenging orchestral parts, Strauss has produced a sophisticated and powerful composition that reflects music’s capacity to narrate stories.</p>

<p>Les Préludes is a symphonic poem composed by Franz Liszt and premiered in 1854. His symphonic poem is one of his most famous compositions and is often seen as an example of the genre. This work is based on a poem by Alphonse de Lamartine of the same name that explores ideas of fate and destiny. Liszt uses a variety of musical devices to illustrate Lamartine&#8217;s poem, including changes in tempo and dynamics, harmonic shifts, and orchestral colour.</p>



<p>Liszt&#8217;s use of thematic transformation in Les Préludes is one of the most striking aspects of the work. Thematic transformation is a compositional technique whereby a musical theme is altered or transformed in order to create a distinct idea or mood. In Les Préludes, Liszt uses this technique to great effect, transforming the main theme of destiny into several different musical ideas that represent different aspects of the poem.</p>



<p>Beginning with three notes (C-B-E), the piece is a dreamy introduction. In a thematic transformation, this motif will be repeated throughout the work. Using this single motif, the music moves from a dawn of enchantment to a tumultuous battle to a triumphant ending.</p>



<p>My first experience listening to Liszt&#8217;s Les Préludes was incredibly moving. With Liszt&#8217;s use of thematic transformation, I could really feel the tension that he had created, although sometimes it was challenging to discern where the main theme was. I really like this piece of music.</p>

<p>Luís de Freitas Branco was a Portuguese composer, musicologist, and professor of music who played a pre-eminent part in developing Portuguese music in the first half of the 20th century. He wrote over 150 pieces of music, including orchestral works, chamber music and works for the stage, as well as songs and choral works. Suite Alentejana No. 1 is one of his most famous works and is known for its energetic rhythms, colourful orchestration and vibrant melodies.</p>



<p>The piece is written for a large orchestra with 3 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, castanets and harp, as well as strings.</p>



<p>Luís de Freitas Branco&#8217;s Suite Alentejana No. 1, written in 1919, is a celebrated work that demonstrates his preference for the Alentejo region of Portugal. Personally, the third and final movement, known as the Fandango, stands out for its vibrant energy and eloquent orchestration. It is written for orchestra with elements of folk music from Alentejo such as a binary-metered rhythm and castanets incorporated into the piece. The form of the piece is tripartite (A-B-A), with an English horn solo leading to a choral section in between two energised sections featuring returning themes. As we close the Fandango brilliantly, the exuberance and vigour of the first section return.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Maria João Pires&#8217; performance was the first I heard. The dynamic range is quite wide and there is a lot of rubato. It seems that she plays faster prior to the louder dynamics and slower prior to the quieter markings. The performance becomes less monotonous and more interesting as a result.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Like Maria João Pires, Rubinstein uses a lot of rubato, especially on the highest notes. In his performance, he sustains high notes subtly to create a more dramatic effect. In spite of the short dynamic range in the Agitato, the last section is intense and played with an astonishing force.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>I listened to Nakamura&#8217;s live performance. During the performance there was a lot of use of rubato, moving faster and slower several times within a short period of time. The first ornaments are played very slowly, compared to other performances, and she doesn&#8217;t completely stop at the fermatas. As a whole, I feel like a lot of creative liberties were taken during the performance regarding speed.</p>

<p>This recording by Lisiecki is the one that follows the score more closely. Particularly the stacatto at the end of the main phrase. It was the only performer I listened to who played stacatto and it opened my eyes to a new perspective. Throughout the piece there is very little rubato nor a lot of variation in dynamics, making it less dramatic than other performances.</p>

<p>Foderova&#8217;s performance is very intense. Maybe because it&#8217;s a live performance. A lot of that intensity comes from the rubato and some creative liberties she takes with the score, but mainly from her pauses. She uses dramatic pauses, especially at the end of the Agitato, which lasts for almost six seconds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Every artistic form that requires performers, such as theatre, cinema, dance, or music, always raises the question: how&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Every artistic form that requires performers, such as theatre, cinema, dance, or music, always raises the question: how personal should a performance be? Should the interpretation of written art be faithful to the author&#8217;s intentions? Does it make sense to contextualize old works to the era in which they were performed? Is there a set of rules to follow? If so, does that make a performance authentic? What is authenticity?</p>



<p>There are many questions when it comes to Performance Practice. I won&#8217;t be able to answer all of them, but I&#8217;ll try to answer &#8220;What is Performance Practice?&#8221;, &#8220;What factors should a performer consider when interpreting a score?&#8221; and &#8220;What makes a good performance?&#8221;.</p>



<p>The field of Performance Practice or Historical Informed Practice studies performance (Rile, 2014), specifically how performance was practised in the past. In general, it focuses on works from the 18th century and earlier that have no contemporary recordings. In order to make an informed interpretation of a piece, a performer should take into account that music reflects the culture of the place where it was composed. In addition to its composer&#8217;s personality, it reflects the values of its society at the time the piece was composed and the instruments available.</p>



<p>A successful performance practice involves a number of factors inherent to the music, including sound, physical space, tuning and temperament, articulation, tempo, and dynamics (Duffin, 2017).</p>



<p>Sound, for instance, describes how instruments sounded at the time of composition. Many instruments have changed since then. Some don&#8217;t exist anymore, and others weren&#8217;t invented until the 18th century (such as the piano). Therefore, when choosing instruments to play, the performer must consider the sound the composer intended.</p>



<p>Dynamic and tempo are also examples. It is usually up to the interpreter to decide what those indications in the scores mean. In terms of tempo, metronomes weren&#8217;t invented until the 19th century, so pieces written before that can&#8217;t be gauged concretely. In fact, there is some debate about whether Bach&#8217;s music has been played faster or slower over time (Niles, 2018). Similarly, dynamics are ambiguous. A forte or piano can mean something different to different performers or even to different venues.</p>



<p>A historically informed performance is also influenced by factors that are extrinsic to music. This includes the social and political context, the piece&#8217;s commission, and the venue where it was to be performed. Factors such as these can help determine intrinsic musical characteristics.</p>



<p>In the end, the most influential factor is the personality of the performer, which influences the interpretation of the piece greatly. Without a performer&#8217;s interpretation, all performances of a piece would sound the same. It is my belief that most composers would not wish to remove that human trait from a performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All arts are human by definition. As a result, such arts will always feature interpretation, improvisation, adaptation, contextualization, ambition, and imagination. Ultimately, what makes a&nbsp;good&nbsp;performance, and specifically good performance practice, will come down to the performer&#8217;s&nbsp;good&nbsp;judgment.</p>

<p>Sonata in D Major, TWV 44:1 is a piece of Baroque music composed by the German composer Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767). It combines elements of concerto and suite genres and is composed for trumpet, strings, and basso continuo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three movements make up the piece, each with its own distinctive character. In Sinfonia Spirituoso, the opening trumpet fanfare presents a lively and energetic start. The second movement, Largo, displays two violins in intimate harmony with the basso continuo. With its lively tempo and energetic tone, the closing movement Vivace brings the piece to a triumphant conclusion.</p>



<p>I found it to be a captivating work of Baroque music with an interesting and multifaceted composition. The opening fanfare immediately captivated me with its bold and triumphant sound.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Some claim that the world is gradually becoming united, that it will grow into a brotherly community as distances shrink and ideas are transmitted through the air. Alas, you must not believe that men can be united in this way.</p><cite>Fyodor Dostoevsky,&nbsp;<em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>&nbsp;(1880)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Globalisation is “a term that describes a new era of human communication and interconnection across cultural, national, and geographic boundaries” (Beaster-Jones, 2013). In other words, it refers to a growing relationship between culture, economy, and people, with an emphasis on the economic side. In this text, cosmopolitanism and globalisation must be distinguished. The first one is a socioeconomic force that strives to homogenize consumption. The second is a personal attitude towards embracing diversity and humanizing it (Petriglieri, 2016).</p>



<p>A modern concept of globalisation might have started with the Roman Empire, which interconnected the world (part of it, to be precise), leading to easier mobility (Bora &amp; Bonelli, 2019). Globalisation was made truly global around the 16th century when the relationship between countries such as Portugal, Spain, India and China intensified (Flynn &amp; Giraldez, 2007). As transportation became easier, safer, and faster, cultures, thoughts, and rituals clashed more frequently in various aspects of society in the 17th and 18th centuries. Culture and music were not exceptions, as music is inherently social.</p>



<p>Globalisation during the romantic period was caused by three factors. First of all, the decrease in aristocracy patronage broadened audiences and gave the artist more room for experimentation with novel sounds, techniques, and instruments. Secondly, artists became more virtuosic and self-expressive, leading to a fusion of their cultural roots with traditional and local music, creating new sounds. Bartók and Chopin, for instance, are known for incorporating folk songs from their birth countries into their music. Lastly, the mobility of artists. Artists (and audiences) have become less limited by time and space and were able to interact across many locations. Apart from the increase in world fairs and music festivals that attracted worldwide audiences, music tourism and travel allowed artists to experience new cultures and be inspired by them.</p>



<p>As a result of increased globalisation, artists experimented more and audiences were predisposed to exploring different sounds, new formats, and new instruments. This resulted in even broader experimentation during the modernist era, which influenced modern music in the 20th century. If artists and audiences weren&#8217;t inclined to merge cultures and experiment with new sounds, genres like blues, jazz, rock, K-pop and reggaeton wouldn&#8217;t exist.</p>



<p>Even though society and music have made remarkable advances, there are some concerns about globalisation. A major concern is the loss of individuality. Cultural homogenization is a risk associated with globalisation, and there is a fear that the individuality and identity of a group will be lost in an effort to incorporate other cultural settings (Back, 2012). There is also concern about undue cultural appropriation, which is a more recent concern. In the context of globalisation, cultural appropriation is unavoidable. However, a question arises as to how we can use other cultures&#8217; proprieties and what processes are legitimate so that we can increase contact between cultures (Choufan, 2021).</p>



<p>In my opinion, all advances in technology are preparing society for increased globalisation. With the advent of streaming music platforms, social networks, and cheap travel, it&#8217;s more common to see the effects of globalisation, such as multi-country genres (K-Pop) or mixed-background bands (The Foreign Exchange and Superorganism). In the future, globalisation may turn into glocalisation (Roudometof, 2016) in which instead of cultural homogenization, local cultures will adapt global phenomena into their own traditions. This can be seen today, where there is a widening diversity of consumption of Spotify and iTunes in different countries than ever before (Bello &amp; Garcia, 2021).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Wagner took around 26 years to complete the Ring Cycle, which consists of four German-language epic music dramas&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Wagner took around 26 years to complete the Ring Cycle, which consists of four German-language epic music dramas lasting about 16 hours. Although the briefing asked for a 500-word essay, I found it challenging to condense such a monumental cycle to that length. The result was a longer text. I watched Opera North&#8217;s performance of The Ring Cycle.</p>



<p>“The Nibelungen Myth as Sketch for a Drama” was Wagner’s first prose sketch in 1848, which sparked his interest in the project. When Wagner began writing the poem (the libretto) for Siegfried’s Death (which became Götterdämmerung), he noticed that the heroic Siegfried had to be described in much more detail and clarity. By working backwards, he crafted Siegfried’s heroic youth story. Siegfried’s parentage and the family history of the Wälsungs are told in Die Walküre. Additionally, Wagner wanted to show how Alberich (the Nibelung dwarf) forged the ring of power from the Rhinegold. The story had been written from end to beginning, and now the music would be composed from beginning to end. In November 1874, the final score for The Ring was completed (Hoover, n.d.).</p>



<p>In Wagner’s vision, this cycle would be set at a festival and performed over three days and one evening. Historically, Wagner had been fascinated by Greek tragedy for some time, and the concept of this opera was a logical fit with those ideals (Hoover, n.d.).</p>



<p>Wagner considered this to be not just a musical composition, but an experience. He introduced the term ‘gesamtkunstwerk’, which means “total work of art”, in two essays in 1849: Art and Revolution and The Artwork of the Future. His goal was to reunite the most common forms of art – music, drama, poetry, and staging (Krause, 2020).</p>



<p>During the development of this opera, he developed much larger orchestras, invented new instruments (the Wagner Tuba was created by him), and took the staging to an entirely unprecedented level. In all likelihood, he was the one who pushed for the lights to be turned down and the drama played in the dark to ensure a better viewing experience (Huizenga &amp; Daugert, 2008). His obsessive specifications led him to build a radically redesigned theatre in Bayreuth, Germany. In doing so, he forever changed the landscape of musical theatre.</p>



<p>In terms of music, this cycle is notable for its use of leitmotifs (over sixty in total). While leitmotifs existed before Wagner, he used them creatively, altering keys, upside down, mixing them together, and more (Midgette, 2021). His music became a narrator and participant in the action, instead of just acting as an accompanist.</p>



<p>This led to the idea of a talking orchestra (Midgette, 2021). It was Wagner’s desire for the orchestra to function like the chorus of a Greek tragedy, predicting, showing, and commenting on what happens. This required sixty-four stringed instruments, four times as many wind instruments, and more prominence for the brass section than was common at the time.</p>



<p>All this grandiosity led to an enormous challenge for the singers. In addition to the length of the opera, the greatest challenge for the singers was to make themselves heard over such a powerful orchestra. The technical difficulty of singing these operas has given rise to the term Wagnerian voice: a voice that is substantial, dense in tone, extremely powerful, and ideally evenly balanced throughout.</p>



<p>Personally, I was most impressed by the amount of work Wagner put into The Ring Cycle. The more research I do, the more I realize how innovative and impactful his work was for our music. By using the orchestra as a storyteller, the music feels a lot like a soundtrack for a movie, very similar to what contemporary composers compose for movies today. It is clear now why composers like Korngold cite Wagner as an inspiration (Ross, 2020).</p>



<p>The development of the characters was another thing I liked. There is no clear line between good and evil. All characters have strengths and flaws, akin to Game Of Thrones and less to Lord Of The Rings. This makes them more human (even Gods) and complex, and the music reflects this.</p>



<p>On the negative side, I felt overwhelmed. Too much is happening all the time, with too many leitmotifs, plots, and themes. It’s true that the leitmotifs appear again and again during the operas, but there isn’t much sense of repetition that makes the ears rest from the continuous novelty. There is almost an impression that Wagner wanted to show all of his virtuosity in one work and to develop his ideas as much as possible. However, it’s always a good idea to remember that less is more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve been reading the book Dilla Time, about the life of James DeWitt Yancey, better known as J Dilla and Jay Dee. He was an American record producer, drummer, rapper, songwriter, and rapper. It is Dilla&#8217;s &#8220;drunk&#8221;, and &#8220;laid back&#8221; time-feel that makes his work unique and difficult to interpret, define, or translate. His production style has inspired some of the world&#8217;s most renowned pop, hip-hop, and jazz musicians &#8212; achieved, in part, because he didn&#8217;t quantize his music (Fitzpatrick, 2011).</p>



<p>While I don&#8217;t listen to a lot of hip-hop, I was intrigued by his stories and how he blew everyone away with his eccentric rhythms, so I decided to check out some of the music he produced or composed (Stadnicki, 2017). My favourite was Running by The Pharcyde, released in 1995.</p>



<p>It begins with a simple maracas sample from James Moody, followed by acoustic guitar from Luiz Bonfá. As I listen to these samples, I realize that the tempo is not always right. I start to understand why people talk about J Dilla when the drums start playing. It seems like the kick drum is rushing (perhaps running?) while the snare is dragging after the hi-hats. This results in strangely relaxed music, with an endless forward motion.</p>



<p>These kinds of not quantized drum sounds are somehow normal nowadays and explored by a lot of musicians, but I can imagine how refreshing it was to listen to such a relaxed and “humanized” beat after listening to so much on-tempo electronic music from the late ’80s and early ’90s.</p>

<p>“Letter from Home” is a composition by American composer Aaron Copland, written in 1944 and commissioned as a patriotic work by Paul Whiteman for his Radio Hall of Fame Orchestra. The piece is a reflection on the experiences of soldiers returning home from war, and the changes that they have undergone during their time away. The piece is written in the style of a letter from a soldier to his family and conveys the bittersweet emotions of coming home after having seen the horrors of war.</p>



<p>The piece begins with a sombre, reflective melody, as the soldier reflects on his experiences and considers the changes that have taken place in his life since departing. The music slowly builds to a more upbeat, hopeful tone, as the soldier finds comfort in the thought of being reunited with his family and friends. The piece ends with a triumphant, joyous melody, as the soldier celebrates the joy of being home. The instrumentation is sparse and haunting, evoking a sense of loneliness and longing.</p>



<p>Ultimately, “Letter from Home” is a powerful and poignant tribute to the soldiers who have sacrificed so much for their country. Through its emotional intensity and evocative musical language, Copland captures the complex emotions of a soldier returning home.</p>

<p>Keith Jarrett is a celebrated American jazz musician and composer. He has been active since the 1960s and has released several acclaimed albums, such as My Song, which came out in 1978. His music often features a sublime simplicity and directness that has made it a favorite among jazz enthusiasts.</p>



<p>The title track of Keith Jarrett&#8217;s 1978 album, My Song, is a timeless piece featuring the collaborative efforts of the European Quartet. The melody is introduced by a pensive piano movement that is soon joined by Jan Garabek&#8217;s saxophone and Jon Christensen&#8217;s percussion, which uses shakers and cymbals to create a soft and muted backdrop. Over the years, My Song has become a popular standard among jazz musicians, with Pat Metheny being one of its most notable interpreters.</p>

<p>Symphonie Fantastique, one of Hector Berlioz&#8217;s most well-known compositions, was composed in 1830. After winning the Prix de Rome, the composer spent fifteen months in Italy between 1831 and 1832, and this experience is especially evident in Harold in Italy. Berlioz preferred the Abruzzi mountains over the academy&#8217;s environment, concerts, and operas in Rome (Bynog et al., 2021).</p>



<p>After Paganini’s commission of Harold in Italy, Berlioz finished it in 1834, not only recalling his experience in Italy as an inspiration for the programmatic structure of this symphony but also drawing inspiration from Lord Byron’s popular poem Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage. This resulted in Berlioz utilizing descriptive titles for each movement and the corresponding programmatic nature of the music since he was aiming for writing “a musical impression of the archetypal romantic hero” (Clements, 2001):</p>



<ul><li>Harold in the mountains</li><li>Procession of the Pilgrims Singing Their Evening Prayer</li><li>Serenade</li><li>The Orgy of the Brigands</li></ul>



<p>Unifying all these movements is the solo instrument: the viola. In his plan, Berlioz envisaged “a series of orchestral scenes in which the viola would be involved […] like an actual person, retaining the same character throughout”. That character would be “a melancholy dreamer in the&nbsp;style of Byron’s Childe Harold” (Deller, 2019).</p>



<p>The most interesting thing is that, facing a plan like this, a composer would be compelled to write strong, loud and bold viola lines in every movement, making the instrument and the player shine. But Berlioz took another approach. In order to create a character like Harold, he made the viola gentle, shy, and quiet. It is the orchestra that can sometimes be loud, rough, and strong.</p>



<p>I was struck by the instruction to play the viola as softly as possible &#8211; barely audible. This paradoxically draws more attention to the instrument. A very quiet performance requires an effort on the part of the audience to be able to hear it. The viola player, however, needs to be highly skilled, since it is more difficult to play loudly than softly. For the sound intensity to be maintained along the bow&#8217;s full length, the performer&#8217;s stance must be firmly grounded with solid shoulders and right arm stability (Bathurst, 2016).</p>



<p>This piece was written in the aftermath of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic devastation and trauma, when society was deciding whether to be ruled by a charismatic leader of a totalitarian or by a humane, humble and compassionate leader (Bathurst, 2016). As a humanitarian (Klein, 1969), I believe Berlioz used the viola as a symbol of the latter, being subtle and quiet and allowing the orchestra to shine when necessary, rather than being the solo instrument that always takes center stage. Paganini might not have realized this when he read the score, but after hearing it and watching the viola&#8217;s role, he understood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It was while researching Berlioz&#8217;s Harold in Italy that I came across an article by French violist Antoine Tamestit. This article stated, in 2015, when he played Harold with John Eliot for the first time, he told German composer Jörg Widmann how delighted he was with the piece. Therefore, Widmann composed a viola concerto filled with narration, journeys and interactions with multiple orchestral instruments.</p>



<p>Based on this description, I decided to watch Tamestit&#8217;s performance with the Frankfurt Radio Symphony conducted by Andrés Orozco-Estrada.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Widmann: Viola Concerto ∙ hr-Sinfonieorchester ∙ Antoine Tamestit ∙ Andrés Orozco-Estrada" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_5WraTt_l_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>My overall reaction was one of awe and I still don&#8217;t know if I liked it or not. However, I believe that was the purpose of this concerto. In one interview, Tamestit explains that this piece is intended to disorient the listener (Todes, 2021). While I sometimes understood what the composer was saying, other times I felt disoriented and I wondered if it wasn&#8217;t just too much theatrical for show&#8217;s sake.</p>



<p>In the same interview, Tamestit talks about how the instrumentation is unusual. This concerto, for instance, requires the soloist to scream throughout and requires the pianist to hold a whiskey glass.</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t expecting such a theatrical performance with such an emphasis on the viola soloist. But as an homage or follow-up to Berlioz&#8217;s symphony, Widmann seemed to want to keep the viola at the center of this performance.</p>



<p>The viola is the focus of this piece, for me. As it takes the listener through the viola&#8217;s different sounds, blending and clashing with other instruments, and finding its place within the orchestra.</p>



<p>Berlioz&#8217;s symphony and this concerto have many connections, but for me, the biggest one is the instrument&#8217;s representation. In Harold in Italy, the viola embodied Harold, here the instrument symbolized itself. As I realized, Widmann attempted to meta-characterize the viola. And that was a brilliant idea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During this exercise, I struggled a lot, so I did some more research about transposing. I found this video by Mattia Chiappa explaining transposing with the guitar (an instrument I am more familiar with) and explaining the difference between the two steps: writing and reading. As a result, I understand better the process of transposing and was able to do the exercise more efficiently.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>My go-to book behind bars was helpful in researching the instrument order on an orchestral score.</p>



<p>I discovered that orchestral and large ensemble scores group instrumental sections in the following order: woodwinds, brass, percussion, keyboards, and strings.</p>



<p>Additionally, no matter how few staves are present within a score, instrumental staves remain in the same position.</p>



<p>Each instrument should be listed in the following order:</p>



<p>Piccolo</p>



<p>Flute</p>



<p>Oboe</p>



<p>Cor Anglais</p>



<p>Clarinet</p>



<p>Bass Clarinet</p>



<p>Saxophones</p>



<p>Bassoon</p>



<p>Contrabassoon</p>



<p>Horns</p>



<p>Trumpets</p>



<p>Trombones</p>



<p>Tuba</p>



<p>Timpani</p>



<p>Percussion</p>



<p>Harp and plucked stringed instruments</p>



<p>Keyboard instruments</p>



<p>Soloists or Choir</p>



<p>Violin I</p>



<p>Violin II</p>



<p>Viola</p>



<p>Cello</p>



<p>Contrabass</p>



<p></p>



<p>In terms of translating instruments, these are the most common languages:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>English</strong></td><td><strong>Italian</strong></td><td><strong>German</strong></td><td><strong>French</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Piccolo</td><td>Flauto piccolo or Ottavino</td><td>Kleine Flote</td><td>Petite Flute</td></tr><tr><td>Flute</td><td>Flauto</td><td>Flote or Grosse Flote</td><td>Flute or Grande Flute</td></tr><tr><td>Oboe</td><td>Oboe</td><td>Hoboe</td><td>Hautbois</td></tr><tr><td>English Horn</td><td>Corno Inglese</td><td>Englischhorn</td><td>Cor Anglais</td></tr><tr><td>Clarinet</td><td>Clarinetto</td><td>Klarinette</td><td>Clarinette</td></tr><tr><td>Bass Clarinet</td><td>Clarinetto basso</td><td>Bassklarinette</td><td>Clarinette basse</td></tr><tr><td>Bassoon</td><td>Fagotto</td><td>Fagott</td><td>Basson</td></tr><tr><td>Contrabassoon</td><td>Contrafagotto</td><td>Kontrafagott</td><td>Contrebasson</td></tr><tr><td>Horn or French Horn</td><td>Corno</td><td>Horn/Horner</td><td>Cor</td></tr><tr><td>Trumpet</td><td>Tromba</td><td>Trompete</td><td>Trompette</td></tr><tr><td>Trombone</td><td>Trombone</td><td>Posaune</td><td>Trombone</td></tr><tr><td>Tuba</td><td>Tuba</td><td>Tuba</td><td>Tuba</td></tr><tr><td>Kettle drums</td><td>Timpani</td><td>Pauken</td><td>Timbales</td></tr><tr><td>Triangle</td><td>Triangolo</td><td>Triangel</td><td>Triangle</td></tr><tr><td>Cymbals</td><td>Piatti/Cinelli</td><td>Becken</td><td>Cymbales</td></tr><tr><td>Glockenspiel</td><td>Campanelli</td><td>Glockenspiel</td><td>Jeu de timbres or Carillon</td></tr><tr><td>Harp</td><td>Arpa</td><td>Harfe</td><td>Harpe</td></tr><tr><td>Violin</td><td>Violino</td><td>Violine</td><td>Violon</td></tr><tr><td>Viola</td><td>Viola</td><td>Bratsche</td><td>Alto</td></tr><tr><td>Cello</td><td>Violoncello</td><td>Violoncello</td><td>Violoncelle</td></tr><tr><td>Contrabass</td><td>Contrabasso or Basso</td><td>Kontrabass</td><td>Contrebasse</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Upon reading Stravinsky&#8217;s quote, I understood it quite intuitively. Due to my advertising background, most of the creative challenges I faced had constraints, so this subject is dear to me. In my experience, it was the &#8220;open challenges,&#8221; those without boundaries or limitations, that were the hardest to overcome.</p>



<p>Considering I could explore the theme more, the 500-word limit felt a bit short to me. There is a lot to discuss about rules&#8217; effectiveness, human bodies and instruments as extrinsic limitations, rules&#8217; roles in AI music composition, and if there is a right amount of restriction that promotes creativity. Nevertheless, I realized that a 500-word essay about constraints needs a constraint, so I summarized my main points.</p>



<p>Throughout this essay, the word &#8220;constraint&#8221; can take on many forms, such as &#8220;rule&#8221;, &#8220;limit&#8221;, or &#8220;boundary&#8221;. In most cases, however, the meaning remains the same. A set of extrinsic and intrinsic restraints that an artist is confronted with when using a creative medium.</p>

	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Essay</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>In this quote, apart from playing with paradoxical word use, Stravinsky was saying that all creativity revolves around solving problems (<meta charset="utf-8">Harnad et al., 2008). I believe he was arguing that for creativity to reach its full potential, there must be some tension that calls for resolution. Many artists, including Mozart (Blanning, 2016), Frank Gehry (Hereld, 2013), and John Stweart (NPR, 2015), have defended the same position. Constraints and problems are essential for artists so that they can find solutions that will produce knowledge.</p>



<p>What artists develop within these limitations and rules depends on their goals and skills. Beethoven broke them (Page, 2019). Gesualdo bent them (Ross, 2011). John Cage created new ones (Savenko, 2021). However, one thing unites them all. Each of them mastered the rules before creating beyond them.</p>



<p>Even when one considers musical genres in addition to musicians, it becomes apparent that they too need rules. New musical genres are created when &#8220;socially accepted rules&#8221; are set over the traditional ones (Fabbri, 1980). There is always a cycle: established rules are mastered; then they are questioned; then new rules are developed.</p>



<p>This was evident when monophonic masses were replaced by polyphonic ones. It was a breaking of the rules of a single melodic line that led to the establishment of new rules by the church at the Trent Council and mastered by Palestrina (Monson, 2002). During the 16th Century, these formal rules led to a strictness in compositional technique, which ultimately led to not only a controlled, contemplative, and accessible sound, but also one that was predictable and standardized. By no means am I arguing that the rules were demeaning the music, but they were purely a necessity for the Church to standardize music during the Renaissance (Mock, 2017), which was a time of profound creative and cultural shifts.</p>



<p>To assist composers in learning these contrapuntal compositional techniques of the 16th Century, Johann-Joseph Fux authored in 1725 the Gradus ad Parnassum, during a time when composers refused &#8220;to be bound by any rules or principles&#8221; (Fux et al., 1971). They are known as species counterpoint and have been a part of the learning of Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn (Norman, nd) and my own learning as well.</p>



<p>To learn and implement these rules, I found it most helpful to understand the &#8220;why&#8221; behind them. For example, understanding why consecutive fifths and octaves, and unison passages can render the music too dull and boring makes it easier to remember than simply telling me &#8220;do not use successive fifths and octaves, or unison passages&#8221;. As well as this, I relied on the progressive learning method, where one learns by doing (Kennedy, 2019). This made learning easier by increasing the difficulty one step at a time and letting my mind become accustomed to the rules as I progressed.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the rules and constraints proved to be beneficial to me, as they helped me learn different harmonization and melodic concepts, and proved effective since I was able to compose much faster than I would without them. They also proved useful in helping me become more creative as I learned to solve some musical problems and maybe even come up with new ones in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On the Academic Music Discord server, someone posted a video about Omar Thomas, a composer I had never heard of before.</p>



<p>A composer, arranger and educator, Omar Thomas was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1984. His parents are Guyanese, and he moved to Boston in 2006 to pursue a Master of Music degree at New England Conservatory.</p>



<p>A piece written for a wind ensemble, Piano and Drum Set, Come Sunday celebrates the Hammond organ&#8217;s central role in black worship. The second movement, Shout!, is an energetic celebration of gospel, jazz and blues, which shows influences from Duke Wellington and Charles Mingus as well as traditional church singing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>In listening to Shout!, I was surprised at how energetic it was after the slow and melodic first movement. There was an instant connection for me to the rhythm of this piece, marked by brass, bass, and drums, with the repetitive woodwinds in a high register adding the necessary tension.</p>



<p>As I listened to this piece, I was reminded of 70s funk horns and woodwinds. That&#8217;s what makes this piece so beautiful. Mixing genres and decades, creating a fresh and joyful time for the listener and for the players.</p>



<p>Since I am unfamiliar with much of the new classical music, I am enjoying this opportunity to listen to contemporary composers. At the same time that I study traditional techniques, I believe this will facilitate me in understanding the paths new composers are taking.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="first-species">First Species</h4>



<p>Using the tips from the First Species, I created a melodic line that was always consonant and moved mostly in contrary motion.</p>

<h4 id="second-species">Second Species</h4>



<p>My greatest struggle came in bars 3 and 4, where I was trying to connect the melody with the given D in bar 4. Keeping with the instructions to make leaps inside the bar, I decided to leap from B to E in bar 3.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="347" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-1024x347.png" alt="" class="wp-image-899" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-1024x347.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-300x102.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-768x260.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-1536x520.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-2048x694.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-640x217.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2-960x325.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Assignment-1-Part-1-2.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 id="third-species">Third Species</h4>



<p>Due to the pre-given patterns in bar 4  (nota cambiata pattern) and bar 6 (double neighbour pattern) in the third species, I started this species backwards in bar 6. Even with the given patterns, I tried to maintain a fluid melodic line with no big leaps, and always respected the previous species&#8217; guidelines.</p>

<h4 id="fourth-species">Fourth Species</h4>



<p>Since the suspension must be resolved downwards and in consonance with the upbeat, I found this one to be the easiest species. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>As compared to the previous species, the fifth one took me a lot lI wasn&#8217;t sure how the bass and alto should harmonize with the tenor while imitating each other. Jacob Gran&#8217;s video helped me realize we should make the three-voice counterpoint as harmonically complete as possible. Thus, for example, in bar 3, the bass is supposed to imitate the tenor by going from D to F, but that would be dissonant. The right choice is E since it makes a C major triad.</p>

<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Violin Concerto &quot;Rhapsody &amp; Fantasia&quot;: Ia. Rock the Violin in Rhapsody.

</div></figure>



<p>In another Spotify discovery, I listened to a piece that I had never heard before. My attention was immediately captured when a traditional drum kit entered playing a classic hip-hop pattern in the first 16 seconds.</p>



<p>Rock the Violin in Rhapsody. Hip-Hop is the first movement of the Violin Concerto &#8220;Rhapsody &amp; Fantasy&#8221; by Eldbjørg Hemsing and Tan Dun. Hemsing is one of the best violinists in Norway, while Tan Dun is one of the most renowned conductors and composers that lives in New York but was born in China.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-issuu wp-block-embed-issuu"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Having found a score for this concerto, I discovered that it includes a strong percussion section with five players, in addition to woodwinds, brass, and strings. It&#8217;s easy to hear the rhythm throughout this piece since it&#8217;s very heavy on it.</p>



<p>My favourite aspect of the piece was the constant play between rhythmic, hip-hop ambient and the almost wild solo violin. The play kept the piece alive and prevented it from becoming monotonous, which could happen with a simple hip-hop beat.</p>



<p>As described by Xenia Hanusiak <a href="https://classicalvoiceamerica.org/2018/09/26/dun-links-ancient-modern-worlds-in-new-violin-work/" target="_blank">in her article</a>, the composer calls this Rhapsody and Fantasia &#8220;the perfect result&#8221; of his thirty-five years of living in New York. It is one of the most interesting pieces I have heard in a while due to its combination of street sound rhythm, classical Chinese instruments, and a harsh nordic violin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4 id="exercise-1-2-first-species">Exercise 1.2: First species</h4>



<p>In this exercise I followed the tip given by the briefing and worked backwards, starting from the last bar. I followed the tip of if the cantus rises from the leading note to the tonic, then the free part falls from the second degree to the octave. From there, I went to the first bar and add an octave. Between bars 2 and 6 I mostly worked stepwise, with a 6th, 3rd, 3rd, 6th, and 6th. I then noticed a leap to get from bar 6 to 7, which didn&#8217;t sound perfect but it didn&#8217;t sound bad either.</p>



<p>In the end, when I listened to it, I found it very dull. Probably because of the mostly stepwise motion and some parallel motion, it sounded predictable. So, I decided to give it another try and start with a 5th.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="201" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-1024x201.png" alt="" class="wp-image-873" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-1024x201.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-300x59.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-768x151.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-1536x302.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-640x126.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1-960x189.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-1-1.png 2047w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Exercise 1.2 first try</figcaption></figure>



<p>I left the last two bars, erased all the rest and started with a C. From there I tried to add some contrary motion with a 3rd, 6th, 6th, 3rd and 6th. From bar 6 to 7 there&#8217;s the same leap as the previous try, but this time it sounded better. Probably because from bar 5 to 6 there is a contrary motion, or because it comes from a 3rd to 6th instead of a 6th to 6th. I&#8217;m not really sure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="201" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-1024x201.png" alt="" class="wp-image-874" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-1024x201.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-300x59.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-768x151.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-1536x302.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-640x126.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1-960x189.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.2-2-1.png 2047w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Exercise 1.2 second try</figcaption></figure>



<p>When I checked the sample solution I was surprised to see that my second try is exactly the same as the solution. I believe this must be because there&#8217;s a much more finite option with just 3rds and 6ths, but I was pleased to know that my effort to make a second try got me closer to what is expected from this exercise.</p>



<h4 id="exercise-1-3-second-species">Exercise 1.3: Second species</h4>



<p>I started this exercise as the previous one, writing the last two bars first and then moving from the first bar until the cadence.</p>



<p>In this case, I followed the tip of leaving the first downbeat with a rest to establish a pulse and started the counterpoint with an octave. From there I wrote all downbeats with consonants and the upbeats I used as passing notes, except in bar 5 because I felt that the top melody needed a higher note to get to the climax.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="187" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-1024x187.png" alt="" class="wp-image-876" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-1024x187.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-768x140.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-1536x280.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-2048x374.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-640x117.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3-960x175.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Exercise-1.3.png 2202w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Exercise 1.3</figcaption></figure>



<h4 id="exercise-1-4-fourth-species">Exercise 1.4: Fourth species</h4>



<p>This exercise was different because some of the notes of the species melody were given. In this case it starts with a 5th that turns into a dissonance with a 4th wich I resolved down one step into a consonant 3rd. The next note was also given and I raised the melody to a 6th that suspends into a dissonant 7th and is resolved to a 6th that leads to raise one step to the final octave.</p>

<p>This exercise was similar to the previous one, but this time with several consecutive suspensions. With the notes given, I developed the species melody following the tips of the Fourth Species and previous ones. For example, started in an octave, kept the range within the octave above, one climax only, the dissonance is resolved on step down on the weak beat and the cadence with contrary motion by step. In the end, one thing I noticed is that the species melody is very predictable between bars 5 and 8, because the P-D-R is always 4th to 3rd. I tried to change this but, with the given notes, it was impossible. I later checked the sample solution and it was the same, so I suppose it&#8217;s the only way to complete this exercise.</p>

<h4 id="exercise-1-5-imitative-counterpoint">Exercise 1.5: Imitative counterpoint</h4>



<p>Initially, I had difficulty understanding the exercise. It didn&#8217;t make sense to me how the motive could fit in the blank spaces. Once you understood how it worked, it became an intuitive exercise. The only thing I couldn&#8217;t figure out was how to add the dash in the lyrics in Sibelius so it appears only in the beat, rather than randomly in the bar, as it appears below. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="565" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-1024x565.png" alt="" class="wp-image-883" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-1024x565.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-300x166.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-768x424.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-1536x848.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-2048x1130.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-640x353.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1-960x530.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Excercise-1.5.1.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Exercise 1.5 first exercise</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was the first time a third voice was added to the exercises. There was no change in the challenge: imitative counterpoint. I found this one easier than the previous one, despite the new voice&#8217;s increased challenge. The gaps only allowed space for imitation of the motive, so I was able to write the motive easily and then check for any counterpoint errors.</p>

<p>Max Bruch (1838-1920) is a well-known prolific German composer. During his long career, he taught, conducted, and composed. In 1911, Bruch composed the Double Concerto in E minor, Op.88. This piece was composed for his son Max Felix Bruch, who was a first-class clarinettist.</p>



<p>A review of Bruch&#8217;s Double Concerto Op.88 premiere, published in Allgemeine Musikzeitung Zeitung No. 40 (1913), called it &#8220;harmless,&#8221; &#8220;weak,&#8221; and &#8220;uninteresting&#8221; (Fifield, 1988).</p>



<p>Initially, I was intrigued by the strange combination of clarinet and viola in this Double Concerto. My impression after listening to this piece is that both instruments can very well mimic human timbres. As a result, the solo instruments have a lyrical and melodic sound. As the two solo instruments weave melodies around each other, the orchestra provides a stable backdrop.</p>



<p>The first movement of this work presents Bruch&#8217;s two solo instruments in a rather dramatic manner. In the beginning, the solo viola is boldly introduced, followed by the clarinet. Throughout the entire movement, it feels as if both instruments are having an intimate conversation.</p>



<p>Upon hearing this movement, I felt as if there was nothing shocking and nothing wrong, at least to my ears. In addition to being a conservative, Bruch was opposed to &#8216;modern madness&#8217; and &#8216;modernists&#8217; like Strauss, Reger, and Debussy (the latter he termed an &#8216;unqualified scribbler&#8217;). As a whole, I enjoyed this piece, especially the interplay between the two solo instruments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As important as the madrigal and chanson, the polyphonic setting of the Catholic Mass was the most significant&nbsp;genre during the Renaissance. Many of the greatest compositions of music have been influenced by musical settings of the Mass.</p>



<h2 id="what-makes-a-mass" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1664189473548 is-style-cnvs-block-section-heading-4 halignleft" >

		<span>What makes a Mass?</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Besides being a religious ceremony, a mass is also a genre of music. The mass, as a ceremony, is a rite of the Roman Catholic church. It is divided into three parts: introductory rites, the liturgy of the word, and the eucharistic liturgy. During this ceremony, the congregation receives bread and wine reenacting the last supper (Keep It Classical, 2021).</p>



<p>Several parts of the liturgy are either spoken, intoned or sung. Some of them, called Proper, vary according to where we are in the liturgical calendar, while others, called Ordinary, remain the same.</p>



<p>Mass as a musical genre is made up of five movements: Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, and Anus Dei sung by the choir during the Ordinary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creating musical continuity among all these different sections was the greatest formal challenge. Several solutions were developed, including repeating the same plainchant (cantus firmus) throughout. This was done well by talented Mass composers. Throughout every section, the cantus firmus is not repeated note-for-note but rather fragmented into long, sustained notes sung by the tenor.</p>



<p>Masses in the Renaissance were generally divided into two categories: those composed based on previously composed materials and those without.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"><table><thead><tr><th>Previously composed materials</th><th>Without previously composed materials</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cantus Firmus</td><td>Cyclic</td></tr><tr><td>Paraphrase</td><td>Soggetto Cavato</td></tr><tr><td>Parody</td><td>Freely Composed</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

		<span>The evolution of the Masses</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>In my research, I have found that most literature focuses on the Mass during the Renaissance period, leaving only minimal attention to the Middle Ages and even less for the following centuries. It may be due to a more uniform unity in style during the Renaissance, pushed by the church. A prominent example is Pope Gregorious&#8217; role in bringing together diverse chants into an orderly and uniform whole for the western region of the Church to use.&nbsp;Similarly, the Council of Trent called for clearer texts, simpler polyphony, and fewer melismas later on (Monson, 2002).</p>



<h5 id="before-1400">Before 1400</h5>



<p>The Roman Catholic Church was the only institution that could educate the populace to become literate and enforce standards of faith and morality. This was due to the barbaric invasion and collapse of the Roman Empire. This institution stood against the grit and dereliction of the Dark Ages. Throughout Western Europe, the Church played a critical role in preserving and transmitting Christian culture, which led to music composition and performance practices. Medieval music had the function of enhancing the liturgy and creating a mood of peace, which could be achieved by singing monophonic plainchant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Middle Ages Gregorian masses were sung monophonically in unison, with a focus on the Proper. A famous example of the first complete setting of the Ordinary of the Mass dates from the 14th century, Guillaume de Machaut&#8217;s La Messe de Nostre Dame.</p>



<h5 id="renaissance">Renaissance </h5>



<p>Between 1400 and 1600 was the main period of Mass composition, when the Mass took on its present meaning of a polyphonic setting of the entire Mass Ordinary.&nbsp; Renaissance composers regarded the Ordinary Mass as the equivalent of 18th-century composers&#8217; symphonies, or 19th-century composers&#8217; operas: the ultimate test of their talents and creativity. In this period, composers within the area of sacred music focused primarily on the forms of mass, with their multiple-movement format offering large-scale structure opportunities (Apel, 2000).</p>



<h5 id="after-1600">After 1600</h5>



<p>The importance of Mass composition declined after 1600. In spite of this, there were developments such as huge choirs of 32 and 48 parts (Orazio Benevoli, 1605-72) and the use of orchestras, leading to Bach&#8217;s B-minor Mass (1733-38) (Apel, 2000).</p>



<p>The mass evolved towards secularization in the 18th and 19th centuries with works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Liszt and Bruckner.</p>



<p>The 20th and 21st centuries saw composers write masses in a variety of styles, forms, and functions that were even more diverse than before (e.g. Vaughan Williams, Stravinsky, Duruflé, Britten, Rutter, Sato).</p>

Mix in your personal views with what you have discovered through research.</em></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-default"><blockquote><p>At the end of the road, music is a religion.</p><cite>(Spitzer, 2021)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>As a result of my research, it&#8217;s quite clear that music and religion have always been closely intertwined, and their impact on who we are today is massive. As a matter of fact, some advocates argue that in place of agriculture and farming, music and religion would be the main drivers of sedentary behavior for humans (Spitzer, 2021).</p>



<p>But which came first? Music or religion? I could not find anyone who could answer this question. This leaves me believing that since humans first beat sticks repeatedly against rocks, there has been a sense of spirituality as well as divinity. This, along with the quote I used to begin this text, sum up what I believe and is supported by my research: religion and music are so closely related that it&#8217;s difficult not to believe they are one and the same. 500 words are too few for me to express my view, but I&#8217;ll try to summarize it into three points.</p>



<h5 id="both-religion-and-music-alter-the-state-of-mind">Both religion and music alter the state of mind</h5>



<p>According to Gilbert Rouget, music can induce two types of altered state of consciousness (ASC) across all cultures, &#8216;trance&#8217; (solitude, silence, immobility, sensory) and &#8216;ecstasy&#8217; (movement, noise, sociable) (Rouget, 1985). The same applies to religion. When dancing for a long period of time, the body suffers from fatigue, hyperventilation, hypoglycaemia, and hypoglycaemia, leading to hallucinations. Overheating at raves releases endogenous opiates. When you fast and sleep less before a rave, the driving rhythms are amplified. There has been evidence of all these effects in religious traditions, from Pentecostal churches in the American Deep South to Sufi dervishes (Spitzer, 2021).</p>



<h5 id="both-religion-and-music-are-based-on-routines">Both religion and music are based on routines</h5>



<p>Religion is embedded in everyday life, and it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise. One of the best examples is when John Cage asked someone about their religion while in Japan.&nbsp;The answer was dance. Japanese practice Buddhist and Shinto rituals, but they don&#8217;t go to church or temple on a regular basis. It is so integrated into the culture that it appears in daily gestures and routines, undisturbed by ordinary life (Byrne, 2017). The same with music. A social organization is marked by song at nearly every point in the lives of communities, according to ethnomusicologist Alan P. Merriam—birth songs, lullabies, naming songs, toilet-training songs, puberty songs, greetings, love songs, marriage songs, clan songs, and funeral songs.</p>



<h5 id="both-religion-and-music-connect-people">Both religion and music connect people</h5>



<p>People turn to religion and music during hard times. There is a search for hope, connection, and optimism among people. Because of its certainty, religious thought is particularly conducive to optimism. In addition, Michael Hogg  asserts that feeling closely connected with others leads to feelings of more security, confidence, and certainty about what to expect in the social world as a result (Hogg, 2003). The same happens with music. There is no doubt that music helps us feel hopeful and secure in times of&nbsp;uncertainty, such as&nbsp;with shows like Live Aid, The Concert For New York City or Concert For Bangladesh.</p>



<p>When I attended Kendirck Lamar&#8217;s concert last time, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was watching a music concert or a worship service. As I looked at other people at the concert, they all seemed mentally altered, either in a trance or ecstatic state. They were making the same moves and singing the same lyrics. Most importantly, they all seemed connected and hopeful.</p>



<p>Was this music or religion?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During my research, I listened to masses from different periods of history, but my focus was exclusively on the Kyrie.</p>



<p><strong>Machaut: Messe de Nostra Dame: Kyrie (1365)</strong><br>(Guillaume &amp; Royllart, 2016)</p>



<p>This Ordinary of the Mass composed before 1365 is considered the earliest complete setting attributable to any single composer. The Kyrie is written in polyphony for four voices and features lots of melismas. This piece is divided into three sections, each with the same structure: polyphony &#8211; plainchant &#8211; polyphony. As far as the sound quality is concerned, I found it to be very diverse, with each voice having its own distinct characteristics, but working together to create a pleasing whole.</p>



<p><strong>Victoria: Missa O magnum mysterium: Kyrie (1592) <br></strong>(Smith &amp; de, 1997)</p>



<p>O magnum mysterium (published in 1572) became the basis for Victoria&#8217;s 1592 Mass for a four-part choir. Since this short Kyrie is in imitation polyphonic texture, the voices do not appear to have any real distinctive characteristic, but rather blend together to achieve a more common sound.</p>



<p><strong>Bach: Mass in B minor: Kyrie I (1749)<br></strong>(Herreweghe, 2011)</p>



<p>Compared to my previous two masses, this is a big difference. This work is for five voices with instrumental accompaniment, which makes a completely different sound from choral masses without accompaniment. It is evident that Bach is stepping up the masses from church music to concert music, making them suitable for a concert hall. In this polyphonic Kyrie, what I found most interesting is the way, from bar 30, the sound never settles until the last bar. The tension and expectation lasts for about 5 minutes.</p>



<p><strong>Mozart: Great Mass in C  minor K.427: Kyrie (1783)<br></strong>(Bernstein et al., 1991)</p>



<p>After listening to it, I understand why it is considered one of Mozart&#8217;s greatest works. It is a magnificent composition for two soprano soloists, a tenor and a bass, a double chorus and a large orchestra. Similarly to Bach&#8217;s mass, Mozart wanted to make the experience more performance and entertainment-based, instead of contemplative and solemn. For me, the most appealing part of this Kyrie is the soprano solo, particularly when it reaches a low Ab and jumps two octaves higher in the following measure.</p>



<p><strong>Beethoven: Mass in C Major, Op.86:I. Kyrie (1807)<br></strong>(Kampen, K.V. <em>et al.</em>, 2005)</p>



<p>Compared to the previous masses I had listened to, the texture of this Kyrie surprised me. In my opinion, Beethoven decided to compose a homophonic-based mass that heavily relied on the choir. Throughout, there is an intriguing play of dynamics, swaying up and down and conveying different emotions in a short space of time, with some parts with breathtaking soaring voices. A note about Gloria in excelsis Deo, which is one of my favourite versions I&#8217;ve heard.</p>



<p><strong>Bruckner: Mass in E minor: Kyrie (1866)<br></strong>(Parkman, 2019)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a mass that feels like a travel back in time, stripped of all instrumental accompaniment and focusing primarily on choral. The combination of choir and brass in this Kyrie really caught my attention. This created a very dramatic and mournful sound. But I was most impressed by the use of silences and the absence of sound in some parts, which gave this piece a huge hollowness.</p>

<p>As usual, my Spotify is on shuffle and today I heard some flamenco, which I am not particularly familiar with, but enjoy listening to occasionally. This song caught my attention, so I listened carefully.</p>



<p>Originally from Ciudad Real, José Almarcha is an outstanding guitarist and composer. As a student of flamenco at the Córdoba Conservatory of Music, José studied with flamenco masters including Paco Serrano and Niño de Pura. A number of dancers have been accompanied by him, including Olga Pericet, Marco Flores, and Antonio Canales. His albums have received excellent reviews and he has been hailed as one of Spain&#8217;s most promising flamenco guitarists.</p>



<p>The singer recently released Casa del Gallego, which is a farruca, a dance-centric style of flamenco characterized by sombre virtuosity, aggressive footwork, and dramatic tempo changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this song, the melody is introduced by a flamenco guitar riff, but a few seconds into the song, there&#8217;s a surprise: a trombone with a delay effect. Not a typical flamenco sound and a hint to the listener that this probably isn&#8217;t a traditional flamenco but yes, a modern view of the style.</p>



<p>Enters the piano a few seconds later. With the trombone on the bottom, the piano on top with high notes, and the flamenco guitar in the middle, the three instruments make a beautiful sonic sandwich.</p>



<p>A mellow melody is gradually introduced by the trio, along with occasional cymbal sounds.&nbsp;Still, the strumming and tapping of guitars always have a slight tension to them. Suddenly, the tension is released as the full band enters, with a Latin rhythm recognizable as flamenco, accompanied by a shoe-tapping sound, along with another surprise: an electric guitar. There is a clash between traditional and modern sounds in the music now, and I find it very appealing.</p>



<p>As the song continues, tension is built and released with more and more shoe tapping and stomping until the apotheosis.</p>



<p>It was very interesting to see how flamenco is approached in a new way. It was entertaining to watch the piece&#8217;s sudden changes in sound dynamics that are intended to be interpreted by a dancer and add drama to the performance.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A master of contrapuntal composition, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina composed 105 masses and 250 motets in the Italian Renaissance. A significant figure in the development of polyphony, he represented the conservatism of the 16th century on the subject of church music.</p>



<p>Though it is widely believed that Palestrina saved polyphony by himself, it is a myth that is widely accepted, although it is also true that the Council of Trent (1545-1563) stressed the importance of musical clarity and Palestrina himself advocated it (Monson, 2002).</p>



<p>Palestrina&#8217;s Missa Brevis (Short Mass) was first published in 1570 and is considered one of his most famous works. There are four voices in the Kyrie (Cantus, Altus, Tenor, and Bassus). With the exception of a brief homophonic section at the end of the second Kyrie, the texture is almost exclusively polyphonic. With a gentle melodic line and simple harmony, this piece stays in F major with only occasional chromatic changes, creating a restful, calm atmosphere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<h3 id="claudio-monteverdi-1567-1643">Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643)</h3>



<p>Monteverdi was an Italian composer, violinist, singer, and priest. He is often considered a revolutionary who marked the transition from Renaissance to Baroque music.</p>



<p>Until the age of forty, Monteverdi worked primarily on madrigals, composing a total of nine books. In about four years, Monteverdi completed his first book of twenty-one madrigals for five voices. Overall, the first eight madrigals show the massive development from Renaissance polyphonic to baroque monodic styles.</p>



<p>He wrote L&#8217;Orfeo, one of the earliest operas in the history of music, an innovative work that remains a part of today&#8217;s orchestra&#8217;s repertoire. Additionally, he has written sacred music.</p>



<h3 id="orlando-di-lasso-1532-1594">Orlando di Lasso (1532 &#8211; 1594)</h3>



<p>Lasso was a Franco-Flemish composer. With more than two thousand compositions to his credit, he was a prolific and versatile author. This collection includes all genres of his day, secular and sacred, including the mass, secular chanson in several languages, Latin motets, hymns, and madrigals. When he held the position of Kapellmeister at the Munich court, at the end of his life, he cultivated sacred music with a special dedication.</p>



<p>He is considered the chief representative of the mature polyphonic style of the Netherlands school, along with Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. At the end of the 16th century, he was one of the most famous and influential musicians in Europe.</p>



<p>Regarding his madrigals, which he penned while living in Rome, his style was clear and concise, and his tunes were memorable.</p>



<h3 id="comparison-between-orlando-di-lassos-matona-mia-cara-and-claudio-monteverdis-ah-dolente-partita">Comparison between Orlando di Lasso&#8217;s Matona, mia cara and Claudio Monteverdi&#8217;s Ah, Dolente Partita</h3>

</div></figure>



<p>The main reason I chose to compare these two madrigals is their contrasting themes. Lasso&#8217;s one is a jovial, lighthearted, and almost mocking monologue between a German soldier and a supposedly Italian woman. Contrary to Monteverdi, his lament is a sombre recognition of death in late life.</p>



<p>From the very beginning, these contrasting themes are evident.&nbsp;Matona, mia cara begins with all four voices in an F Major chord and in a fast tempo. The song develops with a mostly homophonic texture and a very marked rhythm, especially in the &#8220;Don, don, don&#8221; section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ah, Dolente partita opens with only two voices in unison, singing a long, high E. The two voices stay in unison until bar 4 when they drift apart. As a result, it sounds very sorrowful and enigmatic. As the other voices enter, they do so timidly and not simultaneously. Only in bar 15 do all five voices sing together. However, just after that, in bar 16, the top two voices become silent. This creates a variety of aural experiences that convey the theme of lamentation.</p>



<p>Monteverdi&#8217;s madrigal has a more polyphonic texture than Lasso&#8217;s. Consequently, Ah, Dolente partita has a richer sound ambience, but Matona, mia cara has a stronger rhythmic mark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a final contrast, I would like to mention the melodic shape. In Lasso&#8217;s madrigal, there are some upward and downward lines, with a lot of repetition of the melody, so it could be sung in a group with a dance-like feeling.&nbsp;Monteverdi&#8217;s melody, however, tends to move downward or remain flat, which is most evident towards the end, as if the music is taking small steps toward death.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I came across Oscar Peterson through a Mic.com article called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mic.com/culture/oscar-peterson-black-white" target="_blank">&#8220;Did Jazz Forget About Oscar Petterson?&#8221;</a>. The author points out that when you think about jazz names, Petterson&#8217;s is not the first that comes to your mind (Johnson, 2022).</p>



<p>Until today, I was unaware of Oscar Peterson&#8217;s name or work. Therefore, I decided to listen to &#8220;Hymn To Freedom&#8221;, a song featured in the article.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>Oscar Peterson was born in Montreal, Canada on August 15, 1925 and grew up in a family where music was required of all five children. At the age of seven, he was able to play trumpet and piano. In his teens, he was already a prodigy when he became the star attraction of Canada&#8217;s renowned big band, the Johnny Holmes Orchestra (Peterson, 2003), and he was just 20 years old when he made his first trio recordings for RCA.</p>



<p>As a result of his musical genius, he was able to play with and alongside many jazz legends of the era, including Ella Fitzgerald, Roy Eldridge, Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and Billie Holiday (Johnson, 2022).</p>



<p>From 1959-1965, he formed and played with the Oscar Peterson trio with Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums, becoming one of jazz history&#8217;s most celebrated groups. Jazz historian Alyn Shipton explains one of their strengths as &#8220;Peterson&#8217;s skill at promoting group interaction marked the beginning of a seismic shift in piano trios.&#8221; (Hansen, 2014).</p>



<p>During the 1960s, there was racial segregation throughout the United States and Canada, and Peterson suffered a lot of racism when he toured with the Oscar Peterson trio. However, the experience of touring all over the world and especially his experiences in the south of the United States and observing the approach Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. took to peaceful protest, led him to write his most influential work, the “Hymn to Freedom” (Small, 2021).</p>



<p>People all over the world quickly embraced &#8220;Hymn To Freedom&#8221; as the anthem of the Civil Rights Movement when it was written in 1962. A timeless and relevant piece, this song has been played at many major events around the globe.</p>



<p>This song&#8217;s main melody captured my attention from the first listen. The song reminded me of a gospel song infused with blues and jazz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of structure, Peterson plays the melody four times before going into his solo, then returning to the original melody one last time. I believe this is an effective way of structuring a hymn, since the first four times he repeats the melody with almost no variation. As a result, the listener is able to engage with the melodic intention of the song.&nbsp;The piano solo builds upon the previous chord progression, but it is melodically much more unique than those first four repetitions, creating some interest. He concludes the solo with an apotheosis, but then the original melody is played softer, calmer, bringing peace to the listener&#8217;s heart.</p>



<p>My favorite part of this melody is the contrary motion technique, in which both voices go in opposite directions. While I&#8217;m still trying to figure out why I find it so pleasing to hear, I think it&#8217;s because it constantly creates a broader range of sounds. This makes it bigger and more interesting as a way of moving to the next part.</p>

<p>The chords are G minor, E major, D major, G major, D major, and F# Major.</p>



<h5 id="does-this-chord-progression-call-to-mind-any-music-you-know-from-later-eras">Does this chord progression call to mind any music you know from later eras?<br></h5>



<p>Although it didn&#8217;t sound like anything I&#8217;d heard before, I researched why this progression sounded so good together. One of the hints I found was that Gesualdo used mediant chords and doubly chromatic mediant chords, which indeed is true in this chord progression. E major is a doubly chromatic mediant from G minor. </p>

<p>In bars 9-20, I would describe it as a chromatic imitative counterpoint.</p>



<p>The texture at bb. 40-42 is homophonic.</p>



<h5 id="what-does-the-word-dolore-mean-at-b-55">What does the word ‘dolore’ mean at b. 55?</h5>



<p>It means pain, sorrow, and grief.</p>

<p>By itself, the word &#8220;dolore&#8221; implies sorrow, but in the context of the text, it can also mean relief.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>&#8220;but a soul without a heart can feel no sorrow.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>If the character dies or at least has his heart figuratively taken away, he becomes numb and cannot feel pain. A relief from the grief associated with the lover&#8217;s departure.</p>



<p>This is why the texture starts out polyphonic and with dissonances and then turns homophonic and consonant. Additionally, the melody creates a U shape. Starting moving downwards, taking the meaning of the word &#8220;dolore&#8221; to inconsolable grief, shifting to a rising melody towards the final G major chord. I interpret this last rising as Gesualdo&#8217;s acceptance of pain as an immutable truth or perhaps a morbid pleasure from the composer suffering from insanity at the end of his life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I must admit that I didn&#8217;t know who Gesualdo was until today, so I had to make some research about the composer.</p>



<p>A Prince who composed secular madrigals, sacred vocal music, and instrumental music, Carlo Gesualdo da Venosa (c 1566 &#8211; 1613) published six books of madrigals and three books of sacred pieces during his lifetime. He was also notorious for brutally murdering his wife and lover in bed. In addition to this cold-hearted murder, many depraved tales have been told about Gesualdo&#8217;s mental health. Through these stories (whether true or not, it&#8217;s up for debate), we can trace a psychological portrait behind the composer whose work represents the culmination of Renaissance music at the end of the 16th century.</p>



<p>His harmonic language is still considered daring and extravagant today because it incorporates elements of the late Italian madrigals, characterized by sound experimentalism. He used complex chromaticism in a way that was extraordinary for his time. This would not be heard again, or even hinted at until Wagner, Schoenberg and Stravinsky took it to new heights.</p>



<p>This idiosyncratic use of chromaticism was not only an attempt to break the rules, representing his era in which Mannerism was emerging as deliberately disruptive but also had a rather specific objective: word painting.</p>



<p>As an example, when the subject of Amor, pace non chero of his 1st Book of Madrigals calls for his lover, he uses consonance and long notes (Garbuio &amp; Fiorini, 2015).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="676" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-1024x676.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-825" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-1024x676.jpeg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-300x198.jpeg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-768x507.jpeg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-1536x1014.jpeg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-2048x1352.jpeg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-640x423.jpeg 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-960x634.jpeg 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/7887a951ab66eeceed472f273e597ee7fb3586bc-scaled.jpeg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>But in Mille volte il moro of his 6th Book of Madrigals, the Morte (death) is described with uncontrolled polyphony and highly dissonant intervals (Garbuio &amp; Fiorini, 2015).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="674" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-1024x674.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-827" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-1024x674.jpeg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-300x198.jpeg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-768x506.jpeg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-1536x1011.jpeg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-2048x1349.jpeg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-640x421.jpeg 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-960x632.jpeg 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1da1339e64cc90c70e404ab948206bc181d5d580-scaled.jpeg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how the technical complexity and themes changed from one book to another during his short life. The polyphonic tradition of the Renaissance dominates the first two books, while harmonic experimentalism dominates the third and fourth books. The last two, however, are characterized by more chromatic and dissonant writing, typically associated with mature composers. Considering the themes, his first two books are more simplistic, whereas his last two books are more dramatic in depicting themes of torture, pain, sadness, and death.</p>



<p>It surprised me to find that although we see Gesualdo as an avant-garde musical genius of his time, some people consider him conservative. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;As conservative as it was possible to be in this time. Monteverdi was the radical, the new. There is a very curious letter from the poet Guarini, in which he says he prefers Gesualdo to the modern style because he is ‘so far from the hardness of Monteverdi.’ For Guarini, Gesualdo is so nice, so easy! Exactly the opposite of what we now think.”</p><cite>(Ross, 2011)</cite></blockquote>



<p>Even though other contemporary composers experimented with new sonorities and pushed further the boundaries of what music could be, I believe Gesualdo was one of the leading composers of the late Renaissance. While developing polyphony, a better sense of structure and rhythmic order, he explored contrasting emotions (like in Dolcissima mia vita) and influenced composers hundreds of years after his death.</p>

<p>Since my tutor commented that the flute was unsupported by the piano in bar 31, I rewrote the piano to be even more minimalistic in order to create a dramatic point for the flute. This creates a great contrast between the previous and the following busy textures.</p>



<p>In regard to notation, I added a time signature, slurred the grace notes, and reviewed all accidentals, especially the B flats in the B-minor scale that should be A sharps.</p>



<p>With pedal markings, quaver and crochet sounded the same, so, as suggested by the tutor, I reviewed all the notes that had pedal markings to avoid over notating.</p>



<p>To emphasize the staccato sound of the C section, I added some articulation marks.</p>



<p>As the tutor pointed out, the chords were a bit heavy and muddy in bars 43-46. So, I softened the piano chords in those bars.</p>

<p>My reviewed score can be viewed <a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Assignment-4-Revision-Full-Score.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Assignment-4-Revision-Full-Score.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>In my revision, I developed the C and A&#8217; sections since the tutor pointed out that they were the most characteristic passages. In my composition, I explored and developed the uncommon harmonies and the contrapuntal section.</p>



<p>My tutor pointed out that both instruments had a number of challenging passages. As for the bassoon, these passages aren&#8217;t impossible to play and their musical sonority justifies them. The vibraphone, however, had some difficult passages, particularly fast chords of three notes. I changed most of the three-note chords to two-note chords without losing the sonority I intended.</p>



<p>As for the notation, I rearranged the order of the instruments, because the bassoon should be above the vibraphone. Additionally, I deleted the bracket in the vibraphone, changed the font for tempo, and adjusted the layout so that the gaps between the instruments are consistent.</p>

<p>My reviewed score can be accessed <a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Assignment-3-Revision-Full-Score.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Assignment-3-Revision-Full-Score.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>Although the tutor&#8217;s feedback was positive, he pointed out several issues, the biggest of which was the heavyweight of the B and C sections, compared to the lightness and elegance of the A section. The suggestion was that I offer some of the lightness of the beginning in the next sections, so there would be a balance between all sections.</p>



<p>Despite my attempts to incorporate some of the qualities of the opening into the C section, I was not able to do it because every time I tried to change it, I felt that I was losing my sense of what this piece was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, most of the changes were made in section B. Particularly the creation of a two-part counterpoint between the oboe and bassoon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I changed the key signature in the B section from C# to Db because, as the tutor pointed out, five flats are easier to read than seven sharps.</p>



<p>Because there were times when staccatos and repeated notes were under slurs, I reviewed them all. My tutor pointed out that this wasn&#8217;t modern standard notation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the tutor pointed out, the oboe and bassoon did not have any rests and the flute had very few rests. Throughout the piece, I added a few rests for all three instruments, without sacrificing the overall sonority I wanted. Other than the flute, which has a long rest in the middle section, I couldn&#8217;t find space for long rests on the other instruments.</p>



<p>It hadn&#8217;t occurred to me that the two first pages were denser than the rest, so I spread them out.</p>

<ul type="rich" class="wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>It is possible to use classical instruments like the flute in other genders while maintaining their identity.</li><li>Composers can use both traditional and experimental composition to create new and yet familiar sounds.</li><li>There are still a number of huge commercial successes I&#8217;m not aware of and I should look into finding more.</li></ul>



<p>After researching Bach&#8217;s fugues, I came across Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano by Claude Bolling and Jean-Pierre Rampal. The music on this album is an exciting combination of a classical flute and a jazz piano trio.</p>



<p>This album has a really simple story behind it. A French virtuoso jazz pianist, Bolling was Duke Ellington&#8217;s &#8220;spiritual son&#8221;. During his career, he was a pianist, composer and bandleader who wrote more than 100 film scores in a variety of styles (John, 2020). The ease with which he adapted to other musical environments led him to Jean-Pierre Rampal.</p>



<p>Rampal is known as one of the greatest flautists ever, having made the flute a concert instrument and showing how it can adapt to different forms of music (Britannica, 2021).</p>



<p>As Rampal listened to Bolling&#8217;s Sonata for Two Pianists, he asked him to come up with an album that would allow a musical dialogue between a classical flute and a jazz piano (Sklar, 2010). They then composed and recorded the album as a suite of seven movements in 1975, which was a huge commercial success and spent more than a decade on the Billboard classical albums chart.</p>

<p>One of the seven movements, Baroque and Blue, is the album&#8217;s first piece. Originally composed for flute, piano, double bass, and drums, this piece is exceptionally memorable after you listen to it for the first time. Rampal and Bolling combined two worlds the listener is used to in a way that seemed new and yet familiar at the same time.</p>



<p>Even though this isn&#8217;t my favourite track on the album, I feel that it is a good way for the listener to be ready to hear what is to come in the following tracks.</p>



<p>First, we hear the flute&#8217;s motif followed by an imitation of the piano, reminiscent of Bach&#8217;s fugues. Following some more imitation between the piano and the flute, a familiar jazz sound is introduced by the jazz trio. Here&#8217;s how the composers introduce the listener to the combination of jazz and classical music.</p>



<p>We hear a lighthearted, lively, and crisp dialogue between a traditional flute sound, which I feel does not quite capture the swing of jazz, and a jazz trio delivering cool riffs and a feeling of nightclub swing.</p>



<p>In the end, I have the impression that I&#8217;m listening to extremely virtuoso musicians who are trying something out of their comfort zone that, while not a masterpiece, is very enjoyable to listen to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In part 5 of this unit, I explored the role harmony plays in music. To put my research into practice, I composed some exercises to practise chord progressions. The result was that I gained a deeper understanding of how chord harmony supports a melody.</p>



<p>In part 4, I introduced chords through tuned percussion instruments; in part 5, I took it a step further with the piano. As a result, I was able to create a more complex and interesting sound, but it also posed some new challenges. For example, how to create chords that go beyond the simple triad or how to utilize arpeggios instead of chords to keep the sound moving.</p>



<p>In order to provide a fresh perspective to my listening log, my tutor suggested that I listen to contemporary classical music artists. My experience with this was quite interesting as I once again ventured outside of my comfort zone and discovered some inspiring artists.</p>



<h5 id="about-assignment-5">About Assignment 5</h5>



<p>So far, this was my favourite assignment. My ability to explore various sonorities and the introduction of the piano opened up many possibilities for me.</p>



<p>Even though I did not go far outside my comfort zone as I did in assignment four, I tried to create some familiar-sounding passages while adding some novel and unusual parts that I am not entirely sure are good.</p>



<p>The cyclic chord progression was useful in constructing the melody, and I used it five times with two different chord progressions.</p>



<p>In the previous parts of this unit, we&#8217;ve learned that if we modify or augment the same sounds, we can be more economical with the material. In this assignment, I tried to do this, and I was very pleased with the results.</p>



<p>Having reviewed all the assignments I completed, I can clearly see how my sense of rhythm and melody developed along with my confidence.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In assignment 5, I had to compose a piece that used Cyclic chord progressions at least four times within a three-minute span. Although I could compose with any instruments of my choice, I was asked to avoid using a Perfect Cadence until the very end of the piece.</p>



<p>You can find the final score&nbsp;<a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-final-Full-Score.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-final-Full-Score.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and listen to it below:</p>



<p></p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme">The Idea / Theme</h2>



<p>I decided to use what I learned from my research on tango in this assignment and create a tango-inspired piece. The reason I would not call it a Tango is that I feel I need to dig deeper to find out what makes a memorable Tango piece, and mainly because I don&#8217;t want to offend tango lovers.</p>



<p>Additionally, I had fun playing with the element of surprise in my last assignment. Even though the use of cyclic chord progressions may mean repetition, I aim to include some unexpected elements in this piece to prevent it from becoming monotonous.</p>



<p>Regarding the theme, I believe that tango is much about passion and desire, so this piece is about love in all its forms. For instance, it can include passionate love, admiration for a friend, or care for a family member. All of these types of love have one thing in common: they are never linear. They have ups and downs, calm moments, passionate moments, turbulent moments. If it is true love, everything will finally make sense and end in a perfect cadence.</p>



<p>As with all relationships, both parties have unique personalities. Due to this, I chose two woodwind instruments (Flute and Oboe) with a narrator (Piano) to lead the listener through the piece.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="structure">Structure</span></h2>



<p>The structure is based on the concept that each voice has a chance to &#8220;speak&#8221; and then interact with the other voice. As a result, the structure becomes A-B-C-B&#8217;-A&#8217;, where A is dominated by the personality of the first voice, B is dominated by the personality of the second voice, and C is where they interact.</p>



<p>I selected the key of B minor for no particular reason other than it sounded good with a theme I was playing on the piano. Later in the C section, I wanted to modulate to the dominant key, in this case, F# minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section &amp; Triad</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The oboe presents itself as a more mellow and melodic voice</td><td>A &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~50 seconds at 75 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Flute enters with a more rhythm and fast-paced character</td><td>B &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~40 seconds at 95 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Their interactions are sometimes in harmony, but sometimes in discord</td><td>C &#8211; F# minor</td><td>~30 seconds at 80 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Despite their differences, they try to live together</td><td>B&#8217; &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~20 seconds at 75 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Talking about it in turns, they eventually arrive at a consensus</td><td>A&#8217; &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">B minor</td><td>~30 seconds at 95 bpm&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-motifs">The Motifs</span></h2>



<p>From the beginning, I knew I wanted two motifs, one for the flute and one for the oboe. Each motif must be different and appear throughout the piece.</p>



<p>The oboe motif is more melodic and romantic, which I think is perfect for an oboe in the middle range.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="82" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1024x82.png" alt="" class="wp-image-651" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1024x82.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-300x24.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-768x62.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1536x123.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-2048x164.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-640x51.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-960x77.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The oboe and piano play a fraction of this motif in bars 29-30.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="339" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-1024x339.png" alt="" class="wp-image-652" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-1024x339.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-300x99.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-768x254.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-1536x509.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-2048x678.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-640x212.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1-960x318.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-22-1.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>All instruments repeat this fraction in bars 62-66.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="824" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-824x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-655" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-824x1024.png 824w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-242x300.png 242w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-768x954.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-1237x1536.png 1237w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-1649x2048.png 1649w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-300x373.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-640x795.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1-960x1192.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-1.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>Unlike the first voice, the flute&#8217;s motif is mostly semiquavers and is more rhythmic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="291" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-1024x291.png" alt="" class="wp-image-654" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-1024x291.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-300x85.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-768x219.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-1536x437.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-2048x583.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-640x182.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223-960x273.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-223.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>All instruments repeat this motif in bars 51-53.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="824" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-824x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-656" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-824x1024.png 824w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-242x300.png 242w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-768x954.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-1237x1536.png 1237w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-1649x2048.png 1649w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-300x373.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-640x795.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2-960x1192.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-222-2.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></figure>



<p>This motif is augmented by the piano in bars 55-58.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="94" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-1024x94.png" alt="" class="wp-image-657" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-1024x94.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-300x27.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-768x70.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-1536x141.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-2048x188.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-640x59.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24-960x88.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-24.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The piece also includes a note-descending motif that does not belong to any particular instrument and is played throughout in order to tie all sections together. It first appears in bars 5 and 6 on the oboe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="79" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-1024x79.png" alt="" class="wp-image-658" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-1024x79.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-300x23.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-768x59.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-1536x119.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-2048x158.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-640x50.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25-960x74.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-25.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The flute plays a version of it in bars 22-23 and 28-29.</p>

<p>The flute plays this motif in bars 33-34 (inside its own motif), but it has been slighlty transformed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="131" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-1024x131.png" alt="" class="wp-image-661" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-1024x131.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-300x38.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-768x98.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-1536x196.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-2048x262.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-640x82.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28-960x123.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Assignment-5-28.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-rhytms">The Rhytms</span></h2>



<p>Tango is much about rhythm, so I tried to convey it in this piece. As I found out in my research on tango, there are two distinct accompaniment rhythms: marcato and síncopa. Most of this piece uses síncopa, as for example at the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-instruments">The Instruments</span></h2>



<p>I began to think about the piece at this point. We were told that we could use any instrument of our choice, but the hint was that we could use the piano as well. Because I had never composed for the piano before, I decided to research what woodwind instruments were used with the piano. I chose the piano &#8211; flute &#8211; oboe combination because I enjoyed listening to how the three instruments sound completely different in Madeleine Dring&#8217;s Trio for Flute, Oboe and Piano.</p>

<p>Upon hearing Lalliet&#8217;s Terzetto, I immediately thought of composing for the bassoon since it sounded very good with the oboe and piano. Then I realized several of my compositions have bassoons in them, so I decided to leave it out of this assignment.</p>

<p>This arrangement of Schumann&#8217;s 6 Studien in kanonischer Form, Op. 56: IV for oboe and piano was really interesting to listen to. I liked how the oboe suits the piano so well.</p>

<p>This performance of Jean-Michael Damase&#8217;s Trio caught my interest since I was curious to hear how the horn would sound in a three-piece ensemble. Although I have always considered the horn to be a beautiful instrument, here it sometimes sounded well, but in other instances it was too imposing.</p>

<h2 id="the-idea-theme"><span id="the-composition">The Composition</span></h2>



<p><strong>Section A </strong>Bars 1-20</p>



<p>The first part of this section is dominated by the piano and the oboe, with the latter providing a more melodic voice. There&#8217;s something a bit romantic and a little cliché about this melody, giving me a gentle humming of Carlos Gardel&#8217;s voice. In order to convey that this is an inspired piece of tango music, I made this intentionally.</p>



<p>In this section, the chord progression is i &#8211; ii° &#8211; iv &#8211; III &#8211; VII⁶. I developed this progression because I wanted to begin with only minor chords and move to major chords in the last part.</p>



<p>This chord progression is broken up in a transition to the B section using a classic tango rhythm and letting the piano alone so the flute can enter more dramatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section B </strong>Bars 21-38</p>



<p>Bars 21-30 (the first ten bars) continue the previous transition with the introduction of the flute in a high E semibreve. A new chord progression is hinted at in bars 26-30, especially when the C major chord is introduced.</p>



<p>The flute&#8217;s motif is introduced with a new chord progression i &#8211; iv &#8211; ♮II &#8211; vi &#8211; V &#8211; VI from bar 31 to bar 34, which is repeated twice until the end of section B.</p>



<p>I wanted both rhythm and harmony to contrast in this section. Despite the fact that the piano uses essentially the same rhythm as section A, the flute uses mostly semiquavers. Harmonically, I introduce some non-diatonic chords that contrast feelings and surprise the listener.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section C </strong>Bars 39-50</p>



<p>In bars 39-42, I chose to take the contrast a step further with a brief modulation to the key of F# minor. Additionally, the rhythm changes to a marcato rhythm that is played throughout section C.</p>



<p>This section is more contrapuntal, where instruments play their own melodies and none of the previous motifs are heard, creating an impression that this is a completely new section.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section B&#8217; </strong>Bars 51-61</p>



<p>The piece returns to its familiarity in section B&#8217; with the previous chord progression i &#8211; iv &#8211; ♮II &#8211; vi &#8211; V &#8211; VI&nbsp;and interplay between instruments that echo a motif from section B. The climax is reached when both woodwind instruments play a high minim. That is the highest note played by the oboe so far.</p>



<p>A piano solo follows, and the piece moves back to a softer sound.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section A&#8217; </strong>Bars 62-68</p>



<p>The final section begins by mimicking the beginning of the B&#8217; section, in which the instruments play the motif of the A section in turn.</p>



<p>The voices calm down until there is a perfect cadence.</p>

	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Key takeaways </span>
	</span>
</h2>



<ul type="rich" class="wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Spectral music is about experimenting with sound through overtones and creating aural atmospheres through layering.</li><li>Saariaho showed that rules should be viewed as guidelines rather than restrictions.</li><li> A song does not need to depict a moving image. Music can depict a still moment, just like a painting.</li></ul>



<p>To gain a better understanding of what contemporary classical musicians are preoccupied with, my tutor challenged me to listen to more contemporary classical music. I chose Kaija Saariaho after reading that BBC Music Magazine named her the greatest living composer in 2019 (Fiilin, 2019) and the New York Times named her Composer of the Year 2021 (Barone, 2021).</p>



<p>Kaija Saariaho&#8217;s sound was completely new to me because I had never heard it before.</p>



<p>Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho, born in 1952, studied composition at Sibelius Academy and then moved to Germany to study at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg. During this time she felt frustrated by all the forbidden things of post-serialist tradition. “You were not allowed to have a pulse, or tonally oriented harmonies, or melodies,” she said. “I don’t want to write music through negations. Everything is permissible as long as it’s done in good taste&#8221; (Posner, 2018).</p>



<p>In 1980, she first encountered spectral music in France, where she eventually settled. Throughout her career, her work has been influenced by themes that have circulated in French music for decades: melody and harmony derived from overtones, and the fusion of instrumental and electronic elements. IRCAM, which Pierre Boulez founded in 1977, has been an important part of her career (Ross, 2006).</p>



<p>Like Saariaho in 1980, I was unfamiliar with spectralism. The method of using overtones to examine sonorities was a different approach to music, although it isn&#8217;t completely novel in terms of music theory. Overtone series is the building block of Western music &#8211; the octave, the fourth, the fifth, and the major third. The beauty of spectral music lies in the way the different instruments explore and utilize the overtones without becoming dull and boring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I chose Vista because it is a composition from 2021, and I was curious to know what a great composer is working on at the moment. I found this recording of the Helsinki City Orchestra conducted by Susanna Mälkki.</p>



<p><div class="yle_areena_player" data-id="1-50946353"></div><script src="https://player-v2.yle.fi/embed.js" defer=""></script></p>



<p>In my mind, music has always been like motion, like a slice of life imagined by the composer, or a scene from a film transcribed into music. However, I found that Saariaho&#8217;s music can be compared to a picture. In this still moment, all the acoustic nuances combine to create what I believe could be a musical photograph.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vista, which has two parts &#8211; Horizons and Targets, left me with the impression that this was a scene that the composer had imagined. She describes this scene to the listener and how it made her feel.</p>



<p>The scene in Horizons is a very open one, perhaps a field or the sea. She couldn&#8217;t see the end of it, perhaps it was a very flat landscape. The scenery is serene, allowing you to enjoy nature&#8217;s beauty. I would love to see some paintings inspired by Horizons.</p>



<p>Although it uses the same instruments from the previous piece, Targets has a completely different soundscape. It is rough, dry, and turbulent. This looks like a mountainous landscape, with sharp geometric shapes everywhere you look. It&#8217;s not prettier or uglier than Horizons&#8217; landscape, but neither is it peaceful. Maybe it&#8217;s near a city and you can feel the stress.</p>



<p>I enjoyed listening to Vista because it opened up a new musical world to me. Also outstanding about this work is the score, which I found particularly interesting due to the detailed notation for the players.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In this project, we were asked to improvise on a dominant, as long as it stayed interesting, until ending in a perfect cadence.</p>



<p>I aimed to make a longer composition, but I struggled to keep it interesting, so I chose to shorten it in order to not bore the listener.</p>



<p>This exercise is in the key of A major, making the dominant chord the E major. The left hand is always playing the E major chord, which turns into E major 7 on bar 5, and returns to E major on bar 7. Then, on bar 9, it plays an arpeggio of the E major and its inversions, until it reaches the final cadence, from E to A.</p>



<p>The right hand is more fluid and plays a melody that is much more interesting than the left hand repetition. I believe that this contrast makes interesting anticipation for the release of the tension on bar 15.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The aim of this project was to create four different V-I Cadences, each in a different key. Two of them were to be major and the other two minor.</p>



<p>&nbsp;For this exercise, we are asked to make four contrasting attempts at &#8216;dressing up&#8217; a perfect cadence, each in a different key, of which two should be major, and two minor. I was looking forward to attempting this exercise, as the theory is straightforward but there is lots of room for creativity.</p>



<h5 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h5>



<p>The first example is in the key of C major and is completely diatonic. I wanted to give some movement to this cadence, so the right hand is in a descending and ascending journey from G (V) to C(I), and there&#8217;s some syncopation in the left hand also. In the third bar, the V moves to a V7 just before ending in I. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="382" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-13-1024x382.png" alt="" class="wp-image-631" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-13-1024x382.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-13-300x112.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-13-768x286.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-13-1536x573.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-13-2048x764.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-13-640x239.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-13-960x358.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/project-13.png 2220w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h5 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h5>



<p>In this second exercise, I picked the A major key. I wanted to build tension in this exercise just before being released by the perfect cadence. This is achieved by going up in the right hand, while the left hand plays variations of the V and V7. After getting to a high D, the melody goes down until the perfect cadence V-I.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="648" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/project-13-2-1024x648.png" alt="" class="wp-image-729" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/project-13-2-1024x648.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/project-13-2-300x190.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/project-13-2-768x486.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/project-13-2-1536x971.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/project-13-2-2048x1295.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/project-13-2-640x405.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/project-13-2-960x607.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/project-13-2.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h5 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h5>



<p>This exercise is in the key of Eb minor. After composing this exercise, it sounded like Honegger&#8217;s piece I listened at the beginning of this unit. Here, I built up the cadence with right-hand arpeggios and with the left hand going through the notes of the Bb minor chord until the perfect cadence is achieved.</p>

<p>This exercise is in the key of A minor, and has a very fast melody on top of a diatonic bassline. I think this exercise was inspired by my research on ragtime but with a really simple chord progression of I-V-I.</p>

<ul type="rich" class="wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Trying to sound like famous composers can make you feel as though you are creating something of quality, but sounding like yourself will set you apart from others.</li><li>The tango rhythms are really simple, but if you play with tempo and melody, you can get a lot of variety. </li><li>In this work, the violins show that instruments can be just as expressive as the human voice.</li></ul>



<p>In researching Ragtime, I discovered that this music style resembled Tango in some ways. As it turns out, ragtime and tango share some rhythmic styles, such as bass syncopation (Berlin, 2013).</p>



<p>As a result, I learned more about Tango and one of its greatest composers: Astor Piazzolla. Although I had heard Piazzolla before, I hadn&#8217;t listened to his Four Seasons work. Consequently, I decided to listen to it.</p>



<p>Piazzolla was born in Mar del Plata, Argentina, on March 11, 1921. When he was eight years old, his family moved to New York, USA, from where he got his first bandoneon before moving back to Argentina and then again to the USA. As a result of all of this back and forth between Argentina and the US, he was influenced by Tango and Jazz in all of his work (Bach, 1991).</p>



<p>As a 12-year-old, he was already a prolific bandoneon player, until he met Carlos Gardel, one of his idols. He eventually became Gardel&#8217;s translator and bandoneon player as well.</p>



<p>In 1946, Piazzolla moved back to Argentina and formed his own orchestra. He then travelled to France for a Paris Conservatory scholarship. However, his secret goal on this trip to France was to meet Nadia Boulanger, one of the greatest music teachers to ever live (Burton-Hill, 2017). In response to a symphony he composed, she gave him some great advice:&nbsp;&#8220;Something is missing You sound like Ravel, Bartok, Stravinsky, Hindemith but you don&#8217;t sound like Piazzolla. Where is Astor Piazzolla in all this? What do you do!&#8221; (Bach, 1991).</p>



<p>Nadia Boulanger encouraged Piazzolla to pursue what would become known as the New Tango, a unique fusion of tango, jazz, and classical music. His favourite instruments for tango nuevo were the bandoneon, violin, bass, piano, and electric guitar.</p>



<p>I can hear all of these influences in his Buenos Aires Four Seasons, or in the original title Las Cuatro Estaciones Porteñas.</p>



<p>As opposed to Vivaldi&#8217;s Four Seasons, Piazzolla treated the four pieces separately rather than as a single suite. The summer was written in 1965, the winter in 1969, and the spring and autumn in 1970. However, he sometimes performed them together in concerts. In this composition, the four seasons are presented with the focus on Buenos Aires, meaning that each season is seen and heard through the eyes and ears of a city bursting with life and activity.</p>



<p>In 1998, Leonid Desyatnikov composed a new arrangement linked to Vivaldi&#8217;s work for solo violin and string orchestra. Instead of listening to this arrangement, I will listen to the original bandoneon arrangement played by Piazzolla.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Astor Piazzolla - Las cuatro estaciones porteñas (Compilado)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6Jv_JrjJIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>It was generally very enjoyable, particularly the contrast between energetic and almost chaotic forces and subtle and gentle melodies. All of the &#8220;seasons&#8221; follow some kind of fast-slow-fast pattern, which makes them feel very different from what traditional tango used to be.</p>



<p>In traditional tango, the time signature is 4/4 and there are two simple rhythms: marcato, where there are four marks on the beat; and síncopa, where there is an off-beat pattern that includes a number of variations like the most famous Habanera. In Piazzolla&#8217;s&nbsp;Las Cuatro Estaciones Porteñas, I can hear both rhythms but particularly Autumn has a very interesting habanera rhythm.</p>



<p><strong>Spring</strong></p>



<p>The city is waking up from a rainy winter and moving towards sunny days in the spring. In a way, spring is the beginning of life. This is especially evident in this piece where the violin makes a sound that sounds almost like a shout of joy, at mark 01:00. People start moving out of their houses and partying on the streets.</p>



<p>Around 02:30, the calmer part begins and I believe this is a time for romance. As the Spring lovers appear and the seduction begins, Piazzolla demonstrates that Tango is not just about the party and energetic rhythms, it can also be about beautiful and tranquil melodies.</p>



<p>We return to the energetic motif at 03:20 because spring is about letting go of all the tension accumulated during the winter and enjoying the wonderful weather outside.</p>



<p><strong>Summer</strong></p>



<p>Summer in Buenos Aires is extremely hot, making it difficult to spend time outside during the day. I believe that&#8217;s why this piece is not as energetic as Spring. There is some repetition within the melody itself because that is what the heat does to you. Everything becomes more lethargic. The joy returns in the late afternoon and evening. During mark 09:30, we hear the same shouts of joy as in the Spring piece, as well as a hint of celebration and romance.</p>



<p>Piazzolla&#8217;s violin solo brings back the lethargy of the very hot and humid summer of Buenos Aires because perhaps in his mind the daytime has returned.</p>



<p>The joy returns at the end with a bit of joy and síncopa to help bring about a festive mood with the end of summer and colder days to come.</p>



<p><strong>Autumn</strong></p>



<p>While spring is the season for birth, Autumn brings a sense of death and tranquillity. Particularly at mark 17:00, the previous violin shouts have less power and sound almost sad. It brings melancholy to our ears with the nostalgia of spring and summer and the anticipation of a cold winter that comes slowly to us. I feel that by the end of this piece. There are huge, heavy steps of coming winter.</p>



<p><strong>Winter</strong></p>



<p>During the winter, the city moves indoors. Because everything is a little calmer and colder, the tango sounds a little warmer as if it could warm the heart of the dancers. In this piece, I believe Piazzolla envisioned couples dancing close to each other to this tango in order to warm each other and maybe have a little romance in the winter.</p>



<p>The electric guitar sound is quite dominant in this piece, which I believe is meant to emphasize the warm sound needed for the cold winter, just like a musical fireplace.</p>



<p>In the second half, the music starts to gain energy, probably trying to make the anticipation of the Spring to come.</p>



<p>Around mark 26:00, the sound shifts into classical, perhaps a nod to Vivaldi&#8217;s work.</p>

<ul type="rich" class="wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>One key can leave a lot of room for creativity.</li><li>Repetition can be made more interesting by using dynamics.</li><li>Leitmotifs are motifs that represent characters, objects, places, and specific emotions.</li></ul>



<p>This is a prelude from the first opera of Wagner&#8217;s mythic four-opera cycle, The Ring, composed in 1874. It begins on the Rhine, where the Rhinemaidens protect the precious Rheingold (Kay, n.d.). This is the scene that this Prelude establishes.</p>

<p>Upon hearing it, my first reaction was that it was one of the most remarkable openings I have ever heard. Not because of its complexity or memorable themes, quite the opposite. This concept is actually very simple: an entire prelude made out of just one key, E flat major, that doesn&#8217;t go anywhere harmonically. Or maybe it moves to a perfect cadence after 136 bars, and E flat is the V of the A flat that starts the next scene.</p>



<p>In the Prelude to Das Rheingold, the double bass in E flat starts slowly and barely audibly rumbling. Later, the bassoon in B flat is added, followed by the rest of the instruments in a series of layers of repetitive sounds. As the piece progresses, simple notes played in a drone-like manner are accompanied by the increased and overlaid sounds of multiple instruments played without a clearly defined rhythm and downbeat.</p>



<p>The composer&#8217;s intention was to create a mood of birth, I believe. As in nature, the instruments multiply, much like the cells of a growing organism. Possibly here is the birth of the river Rhine, or even the whole universe as it sets up the Opera. When one listens to this piece with their eyes closed and thinks about the birth of anything, one can imagine it starting from something small and growing into something beautiful.</p>



<p>Researching this Prelude, I found that it is used at the beginning of the movie The New World when the English ship arrives in 1607 to establish Jamestown, an English colony in Virginia. This confirms my belief in the atmosphere created by this Prelude.</p>

<p>In researching this piece, I also came across the concept of Leitmotifs. With leitmotifs (leading motifs) Wagner represented characters, objects, places, and specific emotions. In this piece, there are three leitmotifs: nature or genesis, the river or Rhein and the waves (Trythall, n.d.).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1022" height="230" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-17-at-22.20.40.png" alt="" class="wp-image-741" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-17-at-22.20.40.png 1022w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-17-at-22.20.40-300x68.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-17-at-22.20.40-768x173.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-17-at-22.20.40-640x144.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-17-at-22.20.40-960x216.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" /><figcaption>The nature or genesis leitmotif</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="388" height="138" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-17-at-22.23.01.png" alt="" class="wp-image-742" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-17-at-22.23.01.png 388w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-17-at-22.23.01-300x107.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /><figcaption>The river or Rhein leitmotif</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="398" height="70" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-17-at-22.23.24.png" alt="" class="wp-image-743" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-17-at-22.23.24.png 398w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-17-at-22.23.24-300x53.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /><figcaption>The waves leitmotif</figcaption></figure>



<p>My favourite thing about these leitmotifs is that they resemble waves whose intensity increases. In addition to being waves of sound, they can also be perceived as waves of a waking river &#8211; the Rhein. With these leitmotifs, Wagner, I believe, wanted the audience to feel that they were going down in a river and there was nothing they could do but go with the flow.</p>



<p>Having listened and investigated this piece, I now have a better understanding of the concept of leitmotifs, which was not created by Wagner, but taken up by him and developed to the highest level of musical expression in the four operas that make up Der Ring des Nibelungen (BBC Radio 3 &#8211; Opera on 3 &#8211; Wagner&#8217;s The Ring &#8211; Leitmotives, n.d.). From my perspective, this concept had a tremendous impact on music and influenced generations to come. Now, leitmotifs are a common occurrence in movie soundtracks. Think of Darth Vader&#8217;s theme or Jaw&#8217;s two-note suspense. Even advertising has benefited from the development of this concept since jingles have become leitmotifs for brands.</p>

<p>Because of my research on Cadenza, I ended up listening to Beethoven&#8217;s Piano Concerto No. 5, especially the first movement Allegro. In my opinion, this concerto is a perfect example of Beethoven&#8217;s ability to infuse rhythm, depth a power into music. </p>



<p>This first movement starts with a rather unusual presentation of the orchestra and the solo instrument, in this case, the piano. The orchestra plays open chords while the piano plays flourishes of arpeggios, trills, and scales.</p>



<p>Then comes the theme, which in my opinion is very powerful and almost a fanfare. </p>

<p>The development shows all the creative genius of Beethoven, who created a stunning piece that contains repeating themes and different elaborations of them by both the orchestra and the piano. </p>



<p>One thing I found interesting is the duality of the piano &#8211; orchestra because from my listening I think that the piano is more experimental and spontaneous, while the orchestra tends to stay more predictable and harmonious. I believe this was a deliberate thought of Beethoven to create some tension and interest in this 20-minute movement.</p>



<p>The cadenza of Piano Concerto No. 5 a.k.a. Emperor Concerto is a very short part of this piece and it was written by Beethoven, probably because he was unable to perform it and wanted to control all the narrative of this concerto. Following this Emperor Concerto, writing the cadenzas became a common feature among contemporary composers (Lindeman, 1995).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the things I&#8217;m finding most interesting in this course is that I&#8217;m putting names and concepts in things I loved about music. It happened with counterpoint and it happened now with cadenza.</p>



<p>Cadenza is, according to The Oxford Dictionary of Music, &#8220;a flourish (properly, improvised) inserted into the final cadence of any section of a vocal aria or a solo instr movement&#8221; (Kennedy, Kennedy and Rutherford-Johnson, 2012). This music usually culminates in an extended trill, after which the orchestra re-enters, bringing the movement to a speedy conclusion, more often than not without any further participation from the soloist.</p>



<p>The practice of cadenzas originated in vocal music where singers improvised at certain cadences within an aria. The general rule for vocal music was that the cadenza would last no longer than a breath. Composers preferred that performers keep their cadenzas short to prevent interference with the structure of the aria. Since Mozart and Beethoven were writing for their own performances, they felt no inclination to keep things and took this opportunity to show their flashy keyboard skills (Fuller, n.d.).</p>



<p> In other words, it can be described as a parenthesis in music, where the author (in the case of a written cadenza) or the player (in the case of an improvised cadenza) take the liberty of getting out of the structure of the music and create a new focal point of the piece  (Bribitzer-Stull, Matthew, 2006).</p>



<p>After hearing some cadenzas (shown below) I believe that the cadenza has two main purposes: one in itself and the other within the piece. The first is to showcase the singer/player skills; the second is to anticipate a climactic ending. </p>



<p>Going back to the beginning of this post, now I know what Freddie Mercury (one of my favourite composers) was doing when, for example, he used a little cadenza at the end of Barcelona (at minute 3:50) or a slightly bigger one at the end of the live performance of Somebody To Love (at minute 5:00). In both examples, he was showcasing the vocal skills of the singer (Montserrat Caballé&#8217;s skill in the first example, which can be thought of a melisma) and leading the music into an apotheotic ending. </p>

<p>Maybe there are other examples of cadenzas in more popular music, but I can&#8217;t find them. Below are the classical examples I listened to.</p>



<h5 id="wolfgang-amadeus-mozart-piano-concerto-no-20-in-d-minor-k-466-mvt-1-allegro">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart &#8211; Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466. Mvt. 1: Allegro</h5>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KHvNDn-o0s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>This is one of the most cited cadenzas I found through all articles I read. Probably because it joins the work of two geniouses: Mozart&#8217;s concerto and Beethoven&#8217;s cadenza. Mozart&#8217;s Piano Concerto was given its premiere in Vienna on 1785, with the composer at the piano, but sadly, Mozart&#8217;s own cadenza was lost. A few years later in 1809, Beethoven wrote his own. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s full of contrasts and unexpected twists and turns and a fantastic final stretched with a trill that lasts several bars before the orchestra comes in. I was expecting a more virtuosic challenge for the pianist, but what I believe Beethoven achieved was a more emotional and impassioned cadenza.</p>



<h5 id="beethoven-piano-concerto-no-5-in-e-flat-major-op-73">Beethoven &#8211; Piano Concerto No. 5 in E flat major op. 73</h5>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This cadenza that appears near the end of the first movement, was written by the composer itself and it is a really short but elaborate part of this piece. What I found interesting about this cadenza is that it fits the whole movement very well. It comes from the main theme and makes the passage to another theme.</p>



<p>Before the cadenza, the orchestra plays the powerful dotted quaver &#8211; semi quaver &#8211; crochet chords while the piano anticipates a bit of the cadenza. Then the short cadenza starts full of rhythm but then gently eases back into the tutti by accompanying the end of the “cadenza” with a horn theme. </p>



<h5 id="brahms-violin-concerto-in-d-major-op-77">Brahms &#8211; Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 77</h5>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Brahms wrote one violin concerto and it was dedicated to Joseph Joachim. The cadenza appears in the end of Mvt.1 and I believe it is full of passion and melancholy at the same time. It explores the violin capabilites, which fits the purpose of a cadenza: to showcase the player&#8217;s and instrument virtuosities.</p>



<p>The dissonant notes and the strikes on the chords convey a bit of rage that I specially aprecciate. With the runs, I felt that it had some rock and metal sound I used to listen to. It brought me memories of the extended electric guitar solos that showcased the guitarist skills.</p>



<p>In the end, the entering of the orchestra is much smoother than the Mozart&#8217;s piano concerto, and I believe this creates a great contrast with the cadenza, almost like it is a resolution of the violin&#8217;s anger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For part 4 of this unit, I had the opportunity to explore how a counterpoint composition can be developed with the main subject as the focal point. Bach&#8217;s fugues proved to be of great importance here.</p>



<p>I also explored tuned percussion instruments for the first time. I found them varied and versatile. I will certainly explore composition with the timpani and the glockenspiel.</p>



<p>As a result of listening to Ragtime, I also developed a better understanding of rhythm and syncopation in some compositions.</p>



<h3 id="about-assignment-4">About Assignment 4</h3>



<p>So far, this assignment has been the most challenging. The assignment was difficult for me for a number of reasons, but I suspect it was the challenge of writing something different that I placed on myself.</p>



<p>In general, I am not pleased with the composition. It has some parts that I like, especially the motif and some rhythmic details in section C, but as a whole, it doesn&#8217;t appeal to me as much as some of my other compositions.</p>



<p>Despite being aware that a university is a place where people take chances, I will attempt to create something I&#8217;m more familiar with in the next assignment to increase my self-confidence.</p>

<p>In assignment 4, I had to compose an imitative counterpoint for around 3 minutes using woodwinds and tuned percussion.</p>

		<span>The Idea / Theme</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Having felt that my previous assignments were a bit on the safe side, I decided to incorporate the element of surprise into this assignment. It was important for me to try things I hadn&#8217;t done before. I wanted to go to places that made me uncomfortable and use my ingenuity to see if I could surprise myself.</p>



<p>Regarding the theme, along with the idea of surprise, this piece will be about a party, for instance, a wedding, where a dance will be performed by two voices. Then something goes wrong between these two voices, maybe an argument or an altercation that completely changes the mood. Ultimately, both parties reach an agreement and get back to dancing.</p>



<h2 id="the-structure" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1634108659753 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Structure</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The idea largely determines the structure. This turns the structure into an A-B-C-A-B. I envision this piece beginning with an intro (A section) that will be in the same key, but rhythmically different from the B section. When we move from the B section to the C section, there will be a change in key, time signature, tempo, and dynamics to create a full contrast. After this section, we return to the intro and then the B section.</p>



<p>The A section will be in a minor key, the B section in a major key, and the C section in a minor key. In this piece, I will start in the key of E minor, then move to its relative major key of G major. In the C section, I will use the key of B minor, which is a fifth from the key of E minor, because I want to create some contrast without sounding too abrupt.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular cnvs-block-core-table-1628498574118"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section &amp; Triad</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The instruments present themselves and get in the mood for the party</td><td>A &#8211; E minor</td><td>~20 seconds at 75 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>They party and dance together with one instrument initiating the dance and the other following</td><td>B &#8211; G major</td><td>~50 seconds at 95 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>Tension builds up and there&#8217;s a fight</td><td>C &#8211; B minor</td><td>~40 seconds at 80 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>They come into agreement and return to get themselves in the mood for part</td><td>A&#8217; &#8211; E minor</td><td>~20 seconds at 75 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>They slowly return to the dance and party until the end</td><td>B&#8217; &#8211; G major</td><td>~50 seconds at 95 bpm </td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>As I was playing around with the piano, I came up with a motif (in red) that started short and developed into a bigger subject.</p>

<p>Having reviewed a recent video from Philharmonia, I decided to choose the vibraphone because of the sustained sound it produces.</p>

<p>I decided to go with the bassoon for the woodwind instrument again because I am finding it to be much more versatile than I had anticipated.</p>



<p>The combination of these instruments seemed unusual to me, and I was not wrong. Youtube and Spotify returned few results, but I found this performance of a piece by Alexandre Ouzounoff that encouraged me to continue experimenting with these two instruments.</p>

</h2>



<p><strong>Section A</strong> Bars 1-6</p>



<p>As an introduction to the piece, I composed a short section with both instruments presenting themselves in different moods: the bassoon is strong and sustained, and the vibraphone is fast and harmonious.</p>



<p>I was inspired by Stravinsky&#8217;s bassoon solo in Rite Of Spring to start the piece on a high sustained note.</p>

<p>This introduction ends abruptly to convey the main idea of a piece with surprise elements.</p>



<p><strong>Section B</strong> Bars 7-26</p>



<p>Here, the time signature changes and the bassoon plays the main subject, copied by the vibraphone. With the bassoon playing a countersubject in E in bar 13, the vibraphone is now free to play the main subject in G, which now is a major third.</p>



<p>In bar 20, the bassoon returns to the main theme but starts in C, which is a major 4th of G. The vibraphone continues to fill the room with ascending and descending notes.</p>



<p>Both instruments start ascending melodies in bar 23, which leads to a climax and the end of this section.</p>



<p><strong>Section C</strong> Bars 27-40</p>



<p>The section begins with a low dynamic and just the vibraphone playing. Although the key changes to B minor, I wanted to create another level of surprise and ambiguity, so I played an F major chord on the high notes, while the low notes created dissonance.</p>



<p>This section motif is then played by the bassoon, accompanied by a steady rhythm played by the vibraphone. Sometimes the vibraphone completes a triad, such as the A major in bar 28, but sometimes it just plays dissonant tones.</p>



<p>In the absence of harmony between the instruments, the tension rises with minor triads and the tempo increases.</p>



<p>At Bar 36, both instruments play staccato, and the tempo is the fastest in the entire piece. The vibraphone continues with its ascending and descending melody, while the bassoon is more steady in its notes.</p>



<p>At the end, in bar 40, they are both tired of the previous part and rest in minim notes before concluding with a B major triad.</p>



<p><strong>Section A&#8217;</strong> Bars 41-43</p>



<p>The section starts with a chord in G major, marking a key change, and proceeds into a version of the intro.</p>



<p><strong>Section B</strong>&#8216; Bars 44-67</p>



<p>In this section, a bassoon augmented subject is played while the vibraphone plays the motif, followed by a counterpoint.</p>



<p>In bar 56, the bassoon plays an inversion of the subject while the vibraphone plays parts of the motif and triads.</p>



<p>In bar 62, the bassoon plays the main motif, which is quickly repeated by the vibraphone in increasing tones until they both end in a G.</p>

<p>I felt this fugue was really lovely, especially because I enjoyed the theme and Bach used it frequently throughout this composition. In fact, I thought this fugue was quite theme-centric, with the theme inverted, augmented, and rhythmically varied. It’s also worth noting that this fugue goes from a straightforward exposition to a three-voiced narrative.</p>



<p>To be clear, some sources indicate that this fugue is in Eb minor; nevertheless, the prelude is in Eb minor, but the fugue is in D# minor in most scores I discovered. Although I don’t believe it matters, I’ll keep mentioning that this fugue is in D# minor.</p>



<p>This fugue begins with the first voice exposition of the theme, while the second voice (in red) imitate it. Right away, the lowest voice repeats it a second time. Bach repeats this three-bar theme four times in the first 14 bars, which shows how important this theme is to him.</p>

<p>In order to emphasize the theme-centric nature of the fugue, the theme is repeated five times from bar 19 to bar 29, before there is an inversion (in blue). I was interested to see if the inversion is an exact mirror of the theme. I got my answer right away: no. The very first note, D#, goes to an A#, the perfect fifth. However, the inversion goes down a perfect fourth. Following these first notes, everything is mirrored.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="573" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-1024x573.png" alt="" class="wp-image-545" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-1024x573.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-300x168.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-768x430.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-1536x859.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-640x358.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32-960x537.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-12.28.32.png 1888w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Afterwards, the lower voice plays an augmentation of the theme (in green) at double speed. In my opinion, this is where the piece begins to climax and become more complex.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="396" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-1024x396.png" alt="" class="wp-image-546" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-1024x396.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-300x116.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-768x297.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-1536x593.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-640x247.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14-960x371.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-25-at-14.56.14.png 1934w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It is difficult for me to follow and analyze without assistance from here. I noticed that the theme is imitated and reversed as well as amplified and augmented throughout the entire piece, making it a complex and engaging ending.</p>

<p>I found this fugue to be slow, sorrowful, but at the same time, I found it to sometimes be beautifully harmonious. Contrary to other fugues I have heard, I believe this could be played in a church, with the long notes resonating in the long walls. Alternatively, a choral group could perform it.</p>



<p>The theme (in red) and countertheme (in brown) are presented in the first six bars of this fugue, which is interesting. The theme’s long notes are precisely counterbalanced by the countertheme’s quavers, allowing both to be heard clearly. When the third voice is added in the lower bass, it sounds really lovely to me. This produces a really fascinating and recognizable sound that binds all of the voices together.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1008" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-1024x1008.png" alt="" class="wp-image-548" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-1024x1008.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-300x295.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-768x756.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-80x80.png 80w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-640x630.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03-960x945.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.25.03.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I was curious as to how Bach composed the theme and counter-theme to work together so beautifully, so I decided to investigate further. One thing I observed is that both melodies, especially the countertheme, move in a step-by-step manner, only leaping in the finish. This, I believe, allows the intervals to move from fifths to thirds, as seen at the start of bar 5. In addition, the opposing motion in the first two bars, when one of the melodies rises (in red) and the other falls (in blue), generates a lovely contrast and tension, which is released in the last two bars, when both move in the same direction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="678" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-1024x678.png" alt="" class="wp-image-549" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-1024x678.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-300x199.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-768x508.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-640x424.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43-960x635.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-10.41.43.png 1496w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When I previously stated that I considered this piece to be quite harmonic at moments, I was making reference to bars 13 and 14. All melodies, I suppose, have the same function here: to set the stage for the return of the theme and countertheme, but this time in a more powerful form. The theme is mostly played by the two upper voices with the thirds. This brings the piece to a close with a mini-climax.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1001" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-1001x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-550" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-1001x1024.png 1001w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-293x300.png 293w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-768x786.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-1501x1536.png 1501w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-300x307.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-640x655.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10-960x982.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.17.10.png 1604w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" /></figure>



<p>Something new appears later, at the conclusion of bar 20. The motif has been inverted (in blue). This inversion is accompanied by lower voice quavers that sound like the countertheme. I believe this is employed to have a familiar sound with this new inversion theme.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="724" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-1024x724.png" alt="" class="wp-image-551" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-1024x724.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-300x212.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-768x543.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-1536x1087.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-640x453.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16-960x679.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-26-at-11.29.16.png 1668w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One last thing I’d like to mention is something I don’t recall hearing in previous fugues. When two voices play similar melodies while the other two wait their time to play identical tunes. As with prior examples, most of this is done using the third interval. All of this builds up to the final theme and countertheme section.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bassoons are turning into one of my favourite instruments because of their sound and versatility of being able&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bassoons are turning into one of my favourite instruments because of their sound and versatility of being able to be both a rhythmic and melodic instrument. As I was researching about it, I came across the introduction to Stravinsky&#8217;s Rite Of Spring, where the bassoon plays an extremely unusual high note and a beautiful melody. As a result of this unusual sound, I was drawn to listen to the whole piece more closely.</p>



<p>Rite Of Spring was commissioned by Serge Diaghilev, the noted impresario of the Ballets Russes who had also produced The Firebird (1910) and Petrushka (1911) and it was not a huge hit on opening night (Schwarm, n.d.).</p>



<p>In 1913, the Rite Of Spring was received by the audience at the premiere at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in Paris with shouts and yells. There was so much noise that the dancers were unable to hear the orchestra. It was a total disaster (Stravinsky&#8217;s The Rite of Spring: Keeping Score | PBS, 2022). However, later became known as one of the most influential pieces of music of the 20th century.</p>

<p>This piece was influenced by Russian culture and folk-inspired forms and melodies, but its chaotic percussive momentum challenged its audience. Stravinsky, for example, borrowed the bassoon introduction from a Lithuanian folk song titled &#8220;Tu, manu seserėlė&#8221;. But he added multiple instruments and heightened this melody with dissonant melodies, recurrent changes in meter and rhythmic syncopations.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>I can imagine the audience at the premiere of the Rite Of Spring being stunned by the orchestra&#8217;s clash of sounds. After listening to it for the first time, I got shocked when The Augurs of Spring, Dances of the Young Girls began. This work had so much power, violence, and changing rhythms that I was not prepared for it.</p>



<p>This piece relies heavily on rhythm as it leads almost all the parts. Even though the orchestral size of The Rite Of Spring is enormous, sometimes the rhythm is not played by percussion instruments but by other instruments, especially strings. In the Sacrificial Dance as well as The Dance of Young Girls, the orchestra&#8217;s percussive nature can be heard.</p>



<p>The rhythm sometimes evokes an African/Oceanic sound, as at the start of the Ritual of Abduction. Don&#8217;t forget that this piece was written at the height of African and Oceanian colonization. During the colonial period, there was a cultural clash that caused some artists to create art that didn&#8217;t resonate with previous creations. In a previous post, I discussed the importance of polyphony in Polynesia, which had a large French population. I wonder how much this influenced Stravinsky in the Rite Of Spring.</p>



<p>Creatively speaking, the piece possesses a lot of originality. Stravinsky layers a variety of melodies and rhythms on top of each other, creating what some would call noise. Yet ultimately, I believe this is a sonorous experience that requires dozens of listens to understand how each instrument fits into the music.</p>



<p>As I listened to the entire piece, I found it to be more enjoyable than I initially expected. What I enjoyed more than the rhythmic asymmetries, the dissonances, and the layers of ostinatos played simultaneously was the surprise element. Stravinsky played with the listener&#8217;s expectations and never let the music settle in a safe place, even though there are repetitions (especially underlying chords). After the listener becomes comfortable with a sonority, there is a twist, just like a plot twist in a narrative, and everything is new again.</p>



<p>As a result of this unexpected element, I understand why the audience at the premiere was shocked and furious. Apparently, it was the surprise, and I believe it was a loud one, that drove people crazy, even leading to the conductor, Pierre Monteux, admitting that &#8220;everything available was tossed in our direction&#8221; (Jones, n.d.). But this led me to raise a question.</p>



<p>Since when has music not shocked people? Almost since I was born, I recall tv shows, movies, and exhibitions that shocked the public. Music, however, does not seem to have shocked audiences as much. Does this mean that music is becoming less experimental? Is it because the audience is just accustomed to ignoring things they don&#8217;t like? Perhaps the &#8220;Next&#8221; button on the music player is to blame. Nowadays, listeners are not &#8220;obligated&#8221; to sit in a theatre for 90 minutes to hear a piece they&#8217;ve never heard before. What will be the next musical rage?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the first exercise for a two-part experience, I aimed to compose something similar to what I heard from Bach and a more &#8220;traditional&#8221; invention. After reading about invention, I gathered some process rules that allow writing an invention.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Write a motif in one voice</li><li>The second voice repeats the motif in another octave</li><li>The first voice imitates the motif on the dominant</li><li>The second voice imitates the motif it played before but this time on the dominant</li><li>Then use parts or the whole motif in augmented, diminuted or inversed version while the other voice plays counterpoint</li><li>End in the tonic</li></ul>



<p>Although I know these are not strict rules, I tried to apply the process here to help me compose faster and with fewer elements. I must say I liked this process. I started with a motif that is played in both voices on the tonic and on the dominant. I then passed to both voices playing a diminuted version of the motif and ending with the oboe playing an inversion while the bassoon plays an augmented motif. </p>

<p>In my second exercise, I tried to apply a more rhythmic invention while using the marimba. As in the first exercise, I created a motif that is repeated and imitated by both voices. I didn&#8217;t feel the need to augment the motif since I got the sense that I would lose the rhythm of it, so I used a diminuted version of the motif in the marimba while the flute plays an inversion.</p>

<ul type="rich" class="wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Scott Joplin was a remarkable composer who was able to combine African musical influences with classical music from Europe.</li><li>Syncopation adds variety and forward movement to music, making it feel faster even when the tempos aren&#8217;t.</li><li>The I-V progression is useful for conveying comfort and familiarity.</li></ul>



<p>When researching for black composers I came across Scott Joplin, whom, I must admit, I didn&#8217;t know much of his work. Although I had heard some ragtime music before, I was far from knowing what exactly makes a ragtime song and how important it was to modern popular music.</p>



<h4 id="joplins-history">Joplin&#8217;s History</h4>



<p>Scott Joplin was born in northeastern Texas in 1867 or 1868, one of the first generation of African Americans born after slavery was abolished. His father used to be a slave, but his mother was born free. Both of Scott&#8217;s parents were performers, and he and his siblings grew up surrounded by music, primarily African traditional music performed by slaves.</p>



<p>Scott&#8217;s mother recognized his interest in music and was able to find him a free music teacher in exchange for housework. Julius Weiss, a German immigrant who, according to other students, was a follower of the European musical heritage with a special fondness for opera, was his teacher. Scott Joplin&#8217;s music owed a great deal to this. A descendant of an African slaver was not supposed to get a formal education, much less musical education. However, it was because of Weiss that he was able to understand piano technique, music theory, and, most crucially, European musical knowledge such as opera (Berlin, nd.).</p>



<h4 id="the-role-of-joplin-in-rag-music">The role of Joplin in Rag music</h4>



<p>There is no doubt that Scott Joplin&#8217;s music took on the fresh feel it had because of the convergence of African and European music. He combined the syncopation of Afro-American folk music with the harmonization and marching tempos of 19th-century European romanticism to form the ultimate combination (Jasen &amp; Tichenor, 1989). As a result, this led him to ragtime.</p>



<p>According to Grove Music Online, ragtime is &#8220;a style of popular music that flourished from the mid-1890s to 1918. Its main identifying trait is its ragged—i.e., syncopated—rhythm&#8221; (Berlin, 2013).</p>



<p>Joplin was known for his rags, particularly Maple Leaf Rag. Although it was not the first rag to be published, it was one of the most influential compositions in establishing ragtime as the first African-American music style to be widely adopted, earning him the title of King of Ragtime.</p>



<p>The Maple Leaf Rag and many other Joplin&#8217;s rags are considered Classic Rags. By &#8220;classic&#8221; we consider that the rag has a structure that &#8220;has three or four sections, each featuring a different 16-measure musical theme, or melody. In turn, these equal sections are divided into four lines of four measures each. Once a theme is played through, it is generally repeated immediately; in certain cases, it reappears later in the piece.&#8221; (The Library of Congress, Classic Rag).</p>



<p>Maple Leaf Rag is a good example of a Classic Rag since it not only follows the usual AABBACCDD pattern, is in duple meter, and has significant syncopation in the melody, but it is also very well thought out. To perform this composition successfully, you&#8217;ll need a developed pianistic talent.</p>



<p>Scott&#8217;s publisher, John Stark, believed his publications were as good as best classical music, and he promoted his view in elaborate ads. &#8220;Why are the Stark Music Co&#8217;s Rags called Classic? This is the reason: They are intellectual musical thoughts grounded in the emotional principle of humanity.&#8221; <meta charset="utf-8"> (The Library of Congress, Classic Rag).</p>

<p>This composition drew my attention since Joplin defines the rhythm, speed, and atmosphere of the music from the first bar. He doesn&#8217;t build up any anticipation, and there aren&#8217;t many opportunities for both hands to rest. After playing this rag, I can image a pianist becoming really fatigued.</p>



<p>However, I believe that the absence of build-up, along with the melody&#8217;s powerful syncopation, results in a danceable and incredibly catchy music. At the same time, for individuals who are used to classical music and marches, the continuous simple bass progression (which is usually an I-V progression) provides a very familiar and comforting feel.</p>



<p>Philosophically, I believe the contrast between the syncopated melody and the structured bass reflects Joplin&#8217;s position in the artistic culture of the period. On the one hand, having been raised in an African musical background, he came from a culture where syncopated percussion beats are very prominent and where rhythm is vital to making people dance and interact with music. On the other hand, he was given formal classical training that allowed him to learn how the best European classical composers composed their works. The Maple Leaf Rag and others demonstrate that he learned from both cultures and passed them on to the composition.</p>



<p>You can clearly hear the syncopation and the I-V progression in Maple Leaf Rag&#8217;s first bars in the A section, where the bass line plays a steady rhythm, while the melody plays a syncopated rhythm. The syncopation is prominent in the song throughout.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="252" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-1024x252.png" alt="" class="wp-image-562" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-1024x252.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-300x74.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-768x189.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-1536x378.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-2048x504.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-640x158.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6-960x236.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled6.png 2087w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another key point to note is that, like previous classical composers, Joplin knew how to generate tension and release it. My past hearing of folk African music led me to believe that it was heavily reliant on repetition rather than dramatic moments. In bars 7-9, you can sense the tension building up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="289" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-1024x289.png" alt="" class="wp-image-568" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-1024x289.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-300x85.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-768x217.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-1536x433.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-2048x578.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-640x181.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10-960x271.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled10.png 2251w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the B section, Joplin inserts chromatism to give the music a fresh perspective and, in my opinion, to instill the composition with some of his musical understanding.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="291" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-1024x291.png" alt="" class="wp-image-567" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-1024x291.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-300x85.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-768x218.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-1536x436.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-2048x582.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-640x182.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9-960x273.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled9.png 2087w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The modulation from Ab Major to Db Major at the beginning of the C section and back to Ab at the beginning of the D section, especially the last one, is done quite smoothly. Although the modulation to the subdominant is a common ragtime modulation, I feel Joplin handled it in a fluid manner to once again demonstrate his abilities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="308" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-1024x308.png" alt="" class="wp-image-566" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-1024x308.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-300x90.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-768x231.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-1536x462.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-2048x616.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-640x192.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1-960x289.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled8-1.png 2072w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another aspect of this music that I found intriguing is the triumphal finale, which has a counter motion between the voices and a large chord that eventually allows the pianist to rest after demonstrating his abilities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="291" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-1024x291.png" alt="" class="wp-image-564" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-1024x291.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-300x85.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-768x218.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-1536x436.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-2048x582.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-640x182.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7-960x273.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/11/untitled7.png 2087w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Upon hearing Scott Joplin and reading about him, I concluded that he always fought for recognition. Despite the fact that Rags were not considered high-quality music, he had a formal musical education. I believe that confrontation is what caused his pieces to be considered so well-written, timeless, and a template for other styles that grew from it, including jazz.</p>



<p>After having studied both Joseph Bologne and Scott Joplin I find their similarities and differences very insightful. Both came from one musical background and were later exposed to another. But it did not impact them in the same way. The novelty and merge of cultures I was expecting, was more evident in Joplin&#8217;s music. My point is not that one is better or more relevant than the other. The two composers were inspirations and essential to composers who came after them. But when you think of music as an evolving landscape of different artistic viewpoints, I believe Joplin played a significant role in showing composers that you could mix them all and create beautiful pieces of music.</p>

<p>One thought occurred to me while I was searching for music to listen to. What is the reason for the scarcity of well-known African classical composers? I couldn&#8217;t think of one, and a quick Google search reveals that the first dozen names that come up are all white men. I recognize that my lack of knowledge stems primarily from my western culture, so I set out to find black composers, which I am glad I did.</p>

<p>One of the articles I read was from classicfm.com entitled <a href="https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/black-composers-who-made-classical-music-history/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/black-composers-who-made-classical-music-history/" target="_blank">&#8220;9 Black composers who changed the course of classical music history&#8221;.</a> The first featured composer is Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges.</p>



<p>Joseph Bologne was born to a wealthy plantation owner and his Senegalese slave mistress in Basse-Terre, Guadaloupe, in 1745. He received the best education his father could afford during the family&#8217;s move to France and grew into an exceptionally gifted student. He had professional training, as evidenced by his extensive work list, which includes a number of comedic operas, symphonies and concertos, as well as chamber works (Banat, 2001).</p>



<p>Despite his pejorative nickname of The Black Mozart (also known as The Other Mozart), I find myself wondering if it shouldn&#8217;t be the other way around. Joseph Bologne is regarded as one of the greatest composers of the 18th century, according to Marlon Daniel. He was known to frequent salons as a guest of the French nobility, including those of queen Marie Antoinette, who was an accomplished singer herself. He influenced Franz Joseph Haydn, François-Joseph Gossec, Carl Stamitz, and, most notably, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, making him a leader rather than a follower of trends in the musical evolution of his century (Daniel, 2021).</p>



<p>His work was innovative since his earlier compositions, according to a New York Times article. &#8220;The six-string quartets of his Opus 1 were among the first in that genre to be written in France. His three sonatas for keyboard and violin (Op. 1a) feature those instruments as equals, breaking away from the Baroque tradition of basso continuo, which was still very much in vogue&#8221; (Balter, 2020).</p>



<p>Despite how innovative Bologne&#8217;s work may have sounded after listening to his violin concertos, my mind constantly tells me that he sounds a lot like some of his contemporaries. This, I believe, is a case of knowledge bias.</p>



<p>His Violin Concerto No. 9 in G Major, Op. 8 is one of my favourite works. I was struck by the three movements&#8217; energy and rhythm, as well as the motifs he created. I couldn&#8217;t find a free score for this piece, but they can easily compete with other well-known motifs, in my humble and naive opinion. Why hasn&#8217;t his music been used in an advertisement commercial?</p>



<p>The second movement, Largo, is one of my favourites. Despite the fact that it is a slower movement, I consider it to be a continuation of the first movement&#8217;s accentuated rhythm. The syncopation provides a solid sound of descending notes in the first minute, which I find pleasing. In fact, I find this movement to be quite contemporary. While listening to him, I noticed parallels with Nicolas Britell&#8217;s, in my opinion, amazing Succession Tv Show soundtrack, particularly the Adagio in C Minor I show below.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In the end, I was thrilled about this discovery. I&#8217;m not qualified to say whether Joseph Bologne was a better composer than Mozart, but after hearing some of his works, I believe he deserves at least more credit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite not being a huge fan of the Beach Boys, I&#8217;ve always enjoyed this song, mostly because it doesn&#8217;t seem like a typical love song. But I&#8217;ve never given any thought to how this song&#8217;s melody and harmony were created.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-background has-white-background-color is-style-solid-color"><blockquote class="has-text-color has-black-color"><p>“I love God Only Knows and its bow to the baroque that goes all the way back to 1740 and J. S. Bach. It represents the whole tradition of liturgical music that I feel is a spiritual part of Brian’s music.&#8221; &#8211; Jimmy Webb<br></p><cite>Sullivan, 2013</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I chose to explore this piece after reading this quote when researching Bach&#8217;s fugues.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>God Only Knows is regarded as one of The Beach Boys&#8217; best songs and is adored by many musicians, including Paul McCartney who admitted this is one of his favourite songs. (Paul McCartney Comments, n.d.) Brian Wilson and Tony Asher wrote it for the Pet Sounds album with the goal of moving The Beach Boys away from a mainstream boyband sound and musically challenging the Beatles (Whatley, 2021). Paul McCartney later admitted that God Only Knows and the Pet Sounds inspired Sgt. Pepper&#8217;s Lonely Hearts Club Band. So this creative battle was won by all of us.</p>



<p>I believe the song&#8217;s theme is about the end of a relationship and the doubts that follow it. The hesitation in the opening lyrics &#8220;I may not always love you&#8221; distinguishes this song from other love songs. Throughout the lyrics and music, there is a sense of ambiguity, with a really weak tonal centre (Scott, 2019). As David Bennett&#8217;s video shows, the music modulates multiple times, and there are many reversed chords, so the sound never feels stable.</p>

<p>I read various analyses of this song, and while I think the music harmony is beautifully composed, I&#8217;m going to concentrate on melody and counterpoint because these concepts are covered in this section of the course.</p>



<p>The opposing motion between the vocal melody and the bass is the first fascinating melodic design I recognized. As I explained below, there&#8217;s a lively conversation going on between the two voices, with one going down and the other going up, and vice &#8211; versa. Even when they appear to be heading in the same direction, as in bar 3 of this example, they quickly diverge in bar 4. I believe this was written with the goal of drawing attention to the ambiguity and leaving the listener in the dark about what to expect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="837" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled5-1-1024x837.png" alt="" class="wp-image-535" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled5-1-1024x837.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled5-1-300x245.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled5-1-768x628.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled5-1-1536x1256.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled5-1-2048x1675.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled5-1-640x523.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled5-1-960x785.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled5-1.png 2229w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another section that sparked my curiosity was the bridge or brake, in which the keyboards and flute play a short instrumental passage that repeats the preceding opposite motion, but in a much more pronounced manner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="175" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-1024x175.png" alt="" class="wp-image-533" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-1024x175.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-300x51.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-768x131.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-1536x262.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-2048x350.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-640x109.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3-960x164.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled3.png 2190w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This bridge introduces a three-voice counterpoint that I&#8217;ve always found fascinating. I did my best to transcribe as accurately as I could, so it&#8217;s not perfect, but it allowed me to understand how the three voices work together to form triads, and how they mostly move in thirds and sixth intervals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="684" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-1024x684.png" alt="" class="wp-image-536" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-1024x684.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-300x201.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-768x513.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-1536x1027.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-2048x1369.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-640x428.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4-960x642.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled4.png 2078w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The music comes to a close with a round that I discussed in a previous entry.</p>



<p>Overall, I believe I enjoy this song more now that I am fully aware of the incredible labour that went into the melody and the blending of all voices. I see some parallels with Bach&#8217;s work, but I think I need to learn more about Bach&#8217;s music to really see how they might be related.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During this project, I had to practice composing counterpoints for two instruments. There were two parts to the brief. With exercises 1 and 2, one of the instruments is already provided in the briefing, and the challenge is to compose a counterpoint for it. The task in exercises 3 and 4 is to compose two tunes with contrasting characters.</p>



<p>The workbook states that any tuning percussion instrument and woodwind instrument may be used. In order to get more familiar with tuned percussion, I decided to use them in all exercises.</p>



<p>You can download all Sibelius files <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RwWNerEX1QPvJzQT24C15wWg5U_f1dK6?usp=sharing" data-type="URL" data-id="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RwWNerEX1QPvJzQT24C15wWg5U_f1dK6?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<h4 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h4>



<p>With this exercise, the top melody was provided and I was asked to compose the bottom melody. As I looked at the written melody for the first time, I noticed that it had long notes, mirims, and crochets, so I decided to use mostly quavers and semiquavers to have a nice rhythmic contrast. I also took advantage of the opportunity to contrast the dynamics, sometimes having the vibraphone play higher than the flute.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="329" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-1024x329.png" alt="" class="wp-image-521" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-1024x329.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-300x96.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-768x246.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-1536x493.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-2048x657.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-640x205.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1-960x308.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-1.png 2163w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h4>



<p>Here, the bottom part was given, and I composed the top melody. With the first three bars of my melody, I worked with the staccato from the flute by adding semiquavers, resulting in an interaction between the two instruments. In the next three bars, I made the marimba melody follow the descending flute melody, but with fast notes to emphasize the different melodies. The marimba contrasts with the flute in the last three bars by going up while the flute continues to go down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="577" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-1024x577.png" alt="" class="wp-image-522" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-1024x577.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-768x433.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-1536x866.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-2048x1154.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-640x361.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2-960x541.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-2.png 2166w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h4>



<p>In the third exercise, I followed the workbook&#8217;s suggestion and started one melody later than the other, so the listener could more easily pick out the different voices. I developed a little theme that begins with the flute, then the tubular bells accompany it. Following this repetition, however, both melodies drift away. With a wave-shaped melody, the flute is more unstable, with a descending melody in bar 3 and an ascending melody until bar 5. In the meantime, the tubular bells are more stable, using almost always the same rhythm except for bar 7 when they take the opportunity of the calmer flute to express themselves.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="662" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-1024x662.png" alt="" class="wp-image-523" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-1024x662.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-300x194.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-768x497.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-1536x994.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-2048x1325.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-640x414.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3-960x621.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-3.png 2223w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 id="exercise-4">Exercise 4</h4>



<p>Similarly to the previous exercise, I tried to start one melody after another, while the instruments followed a similar theme. I could see how this theme could be used in different ways if it were a longer composition. Thus, for example, the xylophone plays two notes on the first part of the theme while the bassoon plays staccato over the same notes. However, after this repetition, the melodies go the opposite way. Generally, they move oppositely, except in the last bar when both move down and up to the final F.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="681" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-4-1024x681.png" alt="" class="wp-image-524" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-4-1024x681.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-4-300x199.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-4-768x511.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-4-1536x1021.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-4-2048x1361.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-4-640x425.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-4-960x638.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Project-11-4.png 2222w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Moving from monophonic to polyphonic music, in my opinion, was a significant step forward in terms of both complexity and creativity.</p>



<p>I had the opportunity to write for three instruments in this assignment, which proved to be more difficult than I anticipated, especially considering I had to write separate melodies for each of them. I can now better appreciate how great composers like Bach were able to compose in masterful harmony when they used 4 or more voices.</p>



<p>My hearing and analysis of rounds, descants, and, especially, polyphony, I believe, aided me in better understanding how voices might be written in harmony but with differing melodies.</p>



<h3 id="about-assignment-3">About Assignment 3</h3>



<p>As I previously stated, I found this task to be far more challenging than the prior two. Considering three instruments, each with their distinct melodies and &#8220;personalities,&#8221; brought a level of difficulty I hadn&#8217;t anticipated. However, I believe that this additional complexity will be advantageous in the long run as assignment tasks become longer and include more instruments.</p>



<p>In terms of notation, I made an effort to avoid some of the faults I made in earlier assignments, such as rhythmic spelling, correct beaming, and phrasing.</p>



<p>My ability to construct a two-minute composition and transpose the concepts I had in my head to a score surprised me. I wanted to compose a piece that put polyphony to work for the music rather than the other way around. The repeated theme and various small melodies throughout the music, I believe, made this polyphonic composition both familiar and fresh at the same time.</p>



<p>Being self-critical, I think this piece contains too many elements. As a result, I feel that I could turn this into a 4-minute musical piece that develops some of the ideas I wanted to include.</p>

<p>My third task was to compose a work for three woodwind instruments in a mostly polyphonic approach. This composition should last about two minutes and follow a predetermined structure (seen below), in which one begins with a triad, moves to another, and concludes with another.</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8">I had few questions after seeing example 45. Should the first triad last several bars? (If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;ll have to use different chords in the meanwhile, or it&#8217;ll sound stuck). Or is the example intended to be regarded as a chord progression that should be used throughout the piece?</p>



<p>My tutor assisted me with these questions by directing me to consider these triads as harmonic centres for the music.</p>



<p>With this in mind, I decided to use three triads, each representing a different essence of the music, resulting in a piece of music with three parts.</p>

	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Idea / Theme</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>After reflecting on my polyphonic studies, I came up with the idea for this composition. I listened to polyphonic music in three different styles: Renaissance, Baroque, and African/Polynesian polyphony. Because the assignment&#8217;s predetermined structure required three triads, I challenged myself to write a piece of music in three parts, each inspired by a different style of polyphonic music.</p>



<p>About the theme, this piece will be about a love triangle involving three instruments. After meeting and dancing in an African<meta charset="utf-8">/Polynesian section, they progressed to the baroque section, where they fell in love, then finalized the dance with a passionate and harmonious section (Renaissance), showcasing their love for one another.</p>

	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Structure</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The structure was mostly determined upon the development of the idea. This would be a straightforward story in which A leads to B, which leads to C. I wanted the music to begin rhythmically as if the instruments were dancing together and each had its own individuality. Then, in a more melodic section, the instruments repeat the motif as though they discover something in common and fall in love. Ending in harmony and love, each instrument repeats the same motif but then each plays its own melodic line while respecting the harmony of the others.</p>



<p>I decided to produce a piece in the key of C# major after studying pentatonic scales. The other triads and keys were chosen based on the least amount of note change between them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular cnvs-block-core-table-1628498574118"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section &amp; Triad</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The instruments meet and dance together, each with its own personality</td><td>A &#8211; B major</td><td><meta charset="utf-8">~30 seconds at 110 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>They fall in love, repeating the same motif</td><td>B &#8211; C# major</td><td><meta charset="utf-8">~30 seconds at 70 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>They live happily ever after, each with their own motif but harmonically</td><td>C &#8211; Ab major</td><td>~60 seconds at 70 bpm</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

		<span>The Motifs</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>As I had done with prior projects and assignments, I began playing around with the piano, hoping to find a theme that sounded good to me and would serve as a catapult for this composition. After a time, I came upon a motif that I really loved and decided to go a little deeper into it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="75" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-1024x75.png" alt="" class="wp-image-480" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-1024x75.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-300x22.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-768x57.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-1536x113.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-2048x151.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-640x47.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5-960x71.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-5.png 2171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Because the song is divided into three distinct sections, I thought it would be fascinating if the same motif appeared in each section, but was played differently and by different instruments. This way, something would connect all three pieces.</p>



<p>This motif is performed subtly in semiquavers in the A section by the oboe.</p>

<p>The B section is played more explicitly and with quavers by the flute.</p>

<p>The motif is performed by the bassoon nearly in the background with crochets in the C section.</p>

<p>This division was quite helpful in enabling me to start writing each section quicker.</p>

		<span>The Instruments</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Flute, oboe, and bassoon were my natural choices for a woodwind trio. I chose these three instruments because I believe they complement each other in terms of timbre while remaining distinct enough for the listener to hear each one&#8217;s melody.</p>



<p>I listened to three pieces to gain a sense of how a trio of woodwinds works together and how other composers used these instruments.</p>



<p>One of the first instances I found of the three I selected to work with was Antonio Vivaldi&#8217;s Concerto for Flute, Oboe, and Bassoon in G Minor, RV 103. This composition didn&#8217;t particularly appeal to me, but it did teach me how much prominence the flute can have at times, as well as how the oboe and flute can sound good together without clashing, with the flute in a high register and the oboe in a middle and low register.</p>

<p>The Trio for Flute, Oboe, and Bassoon, Op. 86 by Röntgen was an excellent illustration of what I was attempting. Each instrument&#8217;s identity is respected alongside the melody, yet they also repeat each other. This adds a lot of depth to the music.</p>

<p>Pastorale for Wind Trio, Op. 147 by Darius Milhaud omits the flute but includes the clarinet. I was especially inspired by how wonderfully polyphony worked beginning in bar 24.</p>

		<span>The composition</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Section A</strong> Bars 1-9</p>



<p>I intended to portray more rhythmic and fast-paced music in this section. As a result, I employed semiquavers in all three instruments and staccato most of the time.</p>



<p>This section is in the key of B major, although it begins with a D#m triad. The B major triad is present in the second beat of the first bar to create the home triad.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="376" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-1024x376.png" alt="" class="wp-image-481" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-1024x376.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-300x110.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-768x282.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-1536x564.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-2048x752.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-640x235.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23-960x352.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V23.png 2218w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The oboe and flute begin by playing nearly the identical melody with a 3rd, 5th, or 6th interval, but at bar 4 the flute begins to move from a quick staccato to a slower legato. Meanwhile, the bassoon plays a more danceable melody.</p>



<p>This section has the most triad changes, with the majority being B major, D# minor, F# major and G# minor.</p>



<p>This section ends with a VI &#8211; I, reintroducing the home triad and leading to the next triad.</p>



<p><strong>Section B</strong> Bars 10-20</p>



<p>The music here shifts to a more elaborate yet slower paced approach. The speed is reduced to 70 quaver beats per minute, and the notes are predominantly quavers. In bar 11, the flute plainly states that the key signature has changed to C# major.</p>



<p>The home triad, like the first section, is played right at the start to express the feeling of the new home triad. This time, I stuck with the home triad for a little longer than in&nbsp;the first section, with inversions of the triad lasting two bars and the primary motif repeated by the three instruments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="360" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-1024x360.png" alt="" class="wp-image-483" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-1024x360.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-300x106.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-768x270.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-1536x540.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-2048x720.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-640x225.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6-960x338.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-6.png 2218w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In contrast to the preceding section, this one contains a clearly defined chord progression: I &#8211; IV &#8211; iii &#8211; V.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="771" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-1024x771.png" alt="" class="wp-image-484" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-1024x771.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-300x226.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-768x578.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-1536x1156.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-2048x1541.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-640x482.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7-960x722.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Assignment-3-V22-7.png 2222w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It ends with an I &#8211; IV, which leads to the next triad, that is expected to be the V: G# major.</p>



<p><strong>Section C</strong> Bars 21-40</p>



<p>Despite the fact that the tempo remains constant, I wanted the music to feel slower and more harmonized. As a result, I utilized a lot of crochets, minims, and semibreves.</p>



<p>This section is in the key of Ab major. I wanted it to be in G# major scale, but I learned that G# major isn&#8217;t commonly used because it&#8217;s too complex for practical use, and that Ab major is a better option.</p>



<p>In contrast to the other sections, I do not explicitly tell the listener of the key change. Though I begin with the Ab major triad, it isn&#8217;t until the third beat of the second bar of this section (bar 22) that I reach an Ab major triad.</p>



<p>In the final part of this section I wanted to express pure polyphony, with each instrument adding their own melody one at a time, culminating with all three instruments playing distinct melodies until they rise to end in Ab major triad.</p>

<p>Before I could listen to polyphonic music, I needed to define polyphony. There are three types of music textures: monophonic, homophonic, and polyphonic (Copland, Rich and Slatkin, 2011).</p>



<p>So far, I&#8217;ve largely studied monophonic music, which is music composed using a single tune. It does not imply that the music is limited to a single instrument or vocal. Monophonic music can feature percussion and many lines, but they all play the same melody at the same time.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s contemporary popular music is predominantly homophonic. It means that a principal melody is accompanied by a chordal accompaniment. Generally, it is more pleasant to hear than monophonic music because the harmony is played in a way that elevates the main melody.</p>



<p>Polyphony is more challenging than the preceding two. It occurs when two or more melodies happen at the same moment but are unrelated to one another. One of the most distinguishing characteristics of polyphony is that it is difficult to discern which melody is the primary one because each has its own prominence.</p>



<p>I was reminded of a pop tune that contains all three types of musical textures. Come On Eileen by Dexys Midnight Runners makes it simple to understand the three principles. The song begins with a single violin playing in a monophonic texture. The sound then shifts to a homophonic texture, primarily in the chorus. Finally, in the bridge portion, all voices join together in a polyphonic texture with up to three melodies, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Proceeding to my listening of polyphonic music, I decided that it will consist of as many listenings as there are melodies, plus one. To do this, I will try to listen to each melody separately and then all of them together in one final listening.</p>

<p>This is a polyphonic composition of music for four voices (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass), and it is one of the shortest English madrigals, published in 1594.</p>



<p>After a first listen, this music seems to me like a Christmas carol, despite the fact that there is nothing in the lyrics that leads in that direction except the &#8220;cold December&#8221; section. Speaking of the lyrics, this is not a cheerful love poem, and I believe the music reflects the protagonist&#8217;s disappointment.</p>



<p>The song starts with gentle rhythms but ascending melodic lines when describing April and June as metaphors for her beauty and the warmth of her eyes.</p>



<p>But as the song progresses towards the colder months, it becomes a little melancholy and deeper, with the vocals becoming lower in pitch and dynamics. September has lengthier notes and the melodies are more similar.</p>

<p>The most memorable section of the music occurs in December when the tune of &#8220;But in her heart&#8221; is repeated several times by all voices. This is foreshadowing the protagonist&#8217;s disappointment when he discovers she is as cold as December, and all voices get quieter and slower.</p>



<p>For me, the most exciting part is when the voices interact, and you can hear one voice starting at one point and another voice following up where the first left. This example below exemplifies how Thomas Morley considered this, employing quavers to interact amongst the voices, crotchets, and minims when the melodies are independent. This results in a lovely soundscape.</p>

<p>Although it is polyphonic music with individual melodies, there is some round counterpoint, as shown in the examples above and below. This can demonstrate that the composer is not limited to a single style.</p>

<p>Because this is a 40-part motet, I did not follow the guideline of listening to it as many times as there are voices. </p>



<p>It was written about 1570 by Thomas Tallis for eight choirs of five voices each and is regarded as the greatest piece of English early music by certain commentators.</p>



<p>Writing polyphonic compositions is a complex job for the composer and a demanding one for the listener who tries to follow each melody alone. This is especially true for music with more than three or four melodies, so one can only imagine how impressive it is to write for 40 voices and over 11 minutes. An example of Tallis&#8217;s incredible work can be seen in the example below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="691" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-691x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-459" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-691x1024.png 691w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-202x300.png 202w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-768x1138.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-1037x1536.png 1037w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-300x445.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-640x948.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52-960x1423.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-01-at-11.52.52.png 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /></figure>



<p>Concentrating on individual melodies proved difficult in this situation, so I just listened to Spem in Alium as a whole choir song. I must add that it greatly surprised me and gave me a hypnotic sense due to the aural movements of the choirs. Though it is widely assumed that Tallis intended his choirs to be placed in a horseshoe form, I can only imagine how magnificent it would be to hear it live, with all eight choirs positioned in a circle around you, creating a 360º experience.</p>



<p>This piece, in my opinion, can be separated into three parts.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The first choir begins with just a few voices being formed together, then the other chorus joins them in turn. It almost sounds like a round.</li><li>Then, after a brief time when all 40 voices are singing together, we see an inverted movement from the opening section, in which the choirs follow each other in reverse order.</li><li>It is in the final section, which is more like a conversation between choirs, where this piece makes full use of its complexity, jumping between voices as it moves from choir to choir until it ends with all choirs singing together.</li></ul>



<p>Even though I didn&#8217;t find it boring, I thought the music was a bit longer than I would find interesting. Listening to it live would probably transmit the power and the spatial interactivity Tallis intended and keep it interesting for the whole 11 minutes of this piece.</p>



<h4 id="bach-prelude-and-fugue-no-17-in-ab-major-bwv-862">Bach: Prelude and Fugue No.17 in Ab major, BWV 862</h4>



<p>I was interested to listen how the polyphonic music developed from the renaissance era to the baroque. After reading some articles I found that Bach would be a great example of polyphonic baroque music, so I listened to a few of his fugues. The No.17 in Ab major was one the I liked most.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Richter plays Bach: WTC1 No. 17 in A flat major BWV 862" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gCL5Zvnt0TU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The polyphony of the late Baroque differed from that of the Renaissance: It was rooted in tonal harmony and characterized by an energetic, metrically conceived, driving rhythm (Hylton, 2005).</p>



<p>The start of the prelude really interested me because it was such a great way of opening a piece. It reminded me of some rock and heavy metal songs that start with triads in one guitar and a melody in another. </p>



<p>The theme of the prelude is repeated several times by both voices. Since polyphony can be hard to listen, this repetition of the main theme in one voice makes it sound familiar, while the other voice delivers a new and unexpected sound, making it fresh at the same time.</p>



<p>Even from the start is easy to find the differences from renaissance polyphony. More rhythm and more complexity. </p>



<p>Moving to the fugue, the new theme is clearly stated by repetition of the 4 voices, two in Ab major and two in Eb major.</p>



<p>I really like how the voices keep playing the main theme, specially when they rise for a perfect 4th or 5th as in the example below. It gives a really fresh and climatic tone to the music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="983" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-983x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-500" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-983x1024.png 983w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-288x300.png 288w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-768x800.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-1474x1536.png 1474w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-1965x2048.png 1965w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-300x313.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-640x667.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2-960x1000.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/untitled-2.png 2165w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></figure>



<p>Also interesting is that in bar 11 starts a new melody that is repeated by three voices, separating by a perfect 5th and a perfect 4th. This adds again a freshness to the music, and Bach makes sure that although this piece is polyphonic and complex, there is always a familiar tune to be listened.</p>

<p>I find this type of polyphony more interesting than the previous examples I listened, perhaps because I find that the complexity of notes and rhythms add more colour and interest to the piece.</p>



<h4 id="polyphony-of-dorze-people">Polyphony of Dorze People</h4>



<p>While researching polyphony, I came across this statement in the &#8216;Why do people sing?&#8217; book.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-solid-color"><blockquote><p>SubSaharan Africa is the largest and the most active region of distribution of vocal polyphony in the world.</p><cite>(Jordania, 2011)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Therefore, I decided to listen to some polyphony singing from the Dorze tribe in Ethiopia to see and understand the main differences between them and western polyphony.</p>

<p>There are two songs on this recording that I listened to:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Ritual song by young boys</li><li>Spinning song by young girls</li></ul>



<p>The first one had a drone-like effect in one of the voices while the other voices sang a repeated theme. It&#8217;s a pretty rhythmic tune, but it&#8217;s also incredibly repetitive, with the same theme running throughout.</p>



<p>The second song appears to be a three-part polyphony, with one high-pitched solo melody, another group melody, and a low-pitched rhythmical melody. This one appears to be more sophisticated than the last one and more enjoyable to listen to.</p>



<p>The biggest difference between this song and the ones I previously evaluated is that each voice is sung with a specific function in mind, such as a rhythmic voice or a harmonising voice.</p>



<h4 id="tautai-taora-ofrai-leeward-islands"><meta charset="utf-8">Tautai Taora Ofrai (Leeward Islands)</h4>



<p>Little did I know that Polynesia was one of the first places on earth to develop polyphonic music. Europeans discovered Polynesia&#8217;s long tradition of polyphonic music in the 18th century. This discovery was a shocking one for European musicians, who believed that polyphony, as an attribute of a more advanced musical civilization, could have been only a product of the Christian monastery (Jordania, 2011).</p>



<p>This is one of the examples of recorded Polynesian polyphony.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>I got the same feeling after listening to Tautai Taora Ofrai as I did after listening to Dorze People&#8217;s polyphony. It&#8217;s a song with a lot of rhythms, but it&#8217;s also very repetitive.</p>



<p>Apart from that, I found this music to have a structure, with three parts separated by a drone from one of the voices.</p>



<p>Another difference I noticed between the two listenings is that there are more voices (at least four different melodies) and that they don&#8217;t appear to have a specific role, but rather their own melodies that are distinct from the other voices.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Finally, I&#8217;d want to share one anti-polyphony viewpoint that startled me. As in the video below, polyphony was described by Vincenzo Galilei as &#8220;a big mess of incoherent imperfections&#8221;. Despite the fact that I believe these statements to be harsh, I can see why Vicenzo Galilei wrote them. Polyphony is difficult to listen to and, if not properly done, can quickly devolve into a big mess.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The goal of this project was to create three different melodic lines that combined to make a little polyphony. The same triad chord should be used to begin and end the song.</p>



<p>I started with three flutes, as one of the coursework examples suggested, but after experimenting with different melodies, I realized the three voices would sound too similar, so I switched to a woodwind trio of Flute, Oboe, and Bassoon.</p>



<p>This little polyphony was written in a different way from the rest of my projects. I composed vertically, which means I worked on all three melodies at the same time, one bar at a time. I began by deciding on a key (G minor), then came up with a chord progression that I liked: Gm &#8211; Eb – Bb &#8211; Gm. With these factors in mind, I began each bar with the triads of each chord and designed the melodies in each bar to connect the triads.</p>



<p>This way of work was interesting since I didn&#8217;t have a sense of a final melody while I worked, but when I got to the end, I could clearly hear the many melodies. I then made some adjustments to ensure that the voices don&#8217;t clash when played simultaneously, particularly with the 2nd and 7th intervals, which sound dissonant.</p>

<p>In this project, I was tasked with writing a descant for three of the five tunes provided. My decision was determined after listening to the five songs and selecting the three that I liked the best.</p>



<p>After doing some reading on Descants, I tried to incorporate what I learned into my exercises. I used counter-motion, tried to employ thirds and sixths most of the time, and kept the descant rhythmically distinct from the main theme. In addition, I added the descant above the melody.</p>

<p>The main melody made me think that it could be played by the bassoon since in my research I found that the bassoon isn&#8217;t stuck to playing low notes, but can play high notes as well. It then occurred to me I&#8217;d seen a video of Debussy&#8217;s La fille aux Cheveux de lin being performed by bassoon and harp. As a result, I wrote the descant for harp.</p>

<p>Even when the harp is played very quickly, it remains delicate and beautiful; therefore, I used quavers almost exclusively in contrast to the main melody crochets. In this piece, I used relatively little <meta charset="utf-8">contrary motion since I felt that the two instruments contrasted enough and sometimes they even completed each other, as you the example below.</p>

<p>I find the bassoon and oboe to be very celebratory instruments, as I explained before in my log. Because this tune sounded festive, I chose the oboe in contrast to the really high pitched piccolo. As I thought the piece needed some bass, I included the bass drum.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that both the descant and the main theme use quavers and semiquavers, I don&#8217;t think they clash, since I tried to respect the rhythm of each melody.</p>

<p>I chose this tune because I liked it, but I also knew it beforehand, so I tried to have fun. As the music always sounded like a church sound, I decided to go with the organ for the main theme and the choir to sing the descant.</p>



<p>For this exercise, I focused on the rhythmic differences of each tune, except for the finale, which I wanted to be memorable. Because of that, they both have the same rhythm, but they move in opposite directions.</p>

<p>With the descant, I had considerably more fun than I did with the rounds. The main difference is that melody is more about improvisation and novelty, opposite to the more structured thought processes of a round. However, I find that both methods help me get a better sense of vertical composition.</p>

<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Descant is a form of counterpoint, but usually is introduced after the melody is established and sang above the melody</li><li>Descants usually are written in the 3rd and 6th notes of the notes played by the melody</li><li>Although is not used in modern music, I believe it did not disappeared, just evolved</li></ul>



<p>My first step was to look up the definition of Descants. Merriam-Webster defines it as &#8220;a superimposed counterpoint to a simple melody sung typically by some or all of the sopranos&#8221;.</p>



<p>One of the definitions in The Oxford Dictionary of Music is &#8220;In modern hymn singing, a freely written or improvised soprano part added to a hymn tune while the tune itself is sung by the rest of the choir or by the congregation.&#8221; (Kennedy, Kennedy and Rutherford-Johnson, 2012).</p>



<p>In my own words, it occurs when composers introduce a melody over an already established tune and both perform flawlessly.</p>



<p>But one question arose: what is the difference between counterpoint and descant, given that both are melodies over melodies?</p>



<p>I struggled to find an answer to my question, but after some thought, I believe a descant is a type of counterpoint. However, there are two significant differences between regular and descant counterpoints:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>A descant is introduced&nbsp;when the melody has been well established, either via repetition or by being a popular melody, whereas conventional counterpoint can be used at any time. As a result, descants are frequently introduced near the end of a hymn, as as in ‘Hark! the Herald Angels Sing,&#8217; as shown below.</li><li>A descant is a melody that is placed above the melody by high-pitched singers or instruments (What is a… Descant?, 2021). A normal counterpoint can be placed either above or below the melody.</li></ul>



<p>The majority of the examples I discovered were from choral works. As a result, my listening will be primarily focused on two of these works.</p>

<p>The descant is only introduced in minute 2:16 of this Christmas carol, proving my claim that descants are introduced after the main melody is well established. One of the most fascinating aspects of the descant is illustrated in the image below. Both melodies have a contrary motion, so when one goes up, the other goes down. When they appear to clash (in the &#8220;of&#8221; passage), the descant descends to its lowest note, while the main melody ascends to its highest tone. This, together with the use of thirds and sixths, makes a nice contrast.</p>

<p>The descant appears at the end of the song, at the 2:46 mark. And with this song, I discovered another reason to create a descant: it can give the music an apotheotic ending, as I demonstrate below. Look at how the main melody is largely made up of crochets and only utilizes 5 notes, whereas the descant melody is mostly made up of quavers and uses 8 different notes in a descending &#8211; descending &#8211; ascending form. This gives the song a powerful ending.</p>

<p>Later, I came across this video in which one individual I couldn&#8217;t name, claims that the descant was a noble kind of art that is now extinct.</p>

<p>I would argue that if the descant is defined by an improvised line spoken over a known tune, it is not lost but rather moved from the vocal to the guitar. Guitar solos, in my opinion, are the modern equivalent of descant. I understand that this may offend some purist music theorists, but if you think of music as an evolving form of art, it makes sense.</p>



<p>Consider the Merriam-Webster definition (a superimposed counterpoint to a simple melody sung typically by some or all of the sopranos) and consider the guitar solo as a superimposed counterpoint over a simple melody, usually played by higher-pitched sounds and usually introduced after the main melody is established.</p>



<p>There are a million examples of guitar solos, improvised or not, over a melody, but I think the 1950s blues, when the electric guitar became popular, is one fantastic example of how the vocal descant transferred to the guitar solo, or should I say guitar descant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For this project, I had to write 4 perpetual rounds using the given triad progression as a starting point.</p>



<p>I began by looking at what are the guidelines for writing a perpetual round in order to prepare for this Rounds exercise. <a href="http://www.donaldsonworkshop.com/journal/Poesy/music/round/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.donaldsonworkshop.com/journal/Poesy/music/round/" target="_blank">This</a> and <a href="http://blog.mymusictheory.com/2014/how-to-compose-a-canon-or-round-easy-composition/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://blog.mymusictheory.com/2014/how-to-compose-a-canon-or-round-easy-composition/" target="_blank">this</a> website gave me some insight.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Specify how many bars you want before a second voice enters</li><li>Write a chord progression that spans that many bars. (I was given these in this project.)</li><li>Your melody line should be composed of notes from that chord progression, repeating it as many times as you want voices to appear in your round.</li><li>Include notes that were not in the chords, in order to make the melody more interesting.</li></ul>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>



<p>I didn&#8217;t particularly enjoy composing rounds, but I acknowledge that this project supported my learning since I can plainly see how this unit progresses from a single melody to counterpoint and harmony. The method I composed rounds was to make sure that all voices had chord notes in the beat. I tried to use notes from the scale in between beats to ensure that no notes collided in between voices. I didn&#8217;t include any instruments in my scores because my intention was to keep the rounds basic while still allowing for as many timbres as feasible.</p>

<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled-positive"><li>Use sounds other than traticional acoustic instruments to convey an atmosphere</li><li>Keep the melody interesting by beginning notes just before or after they should begin</li><li>Surprise the audience with key changes</li></ul>



<p>For me, Stevie Wonder is an acquired taste. I didn&#8217;t love his music as much when I was younger, but as I&#8217;ve gotten older, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate and admire how he created such beautiful songs.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that his album Songs In The Key Of Life is widely regarded as his masterpiece, one of his songs that I particularly enjoy listening to is Overjoyed. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot of literature devoted to describing how Stevie Wonder composed his songs, but I wanted to understand for myself why I appreciate this song so much and what composing talents he used to achieve such a wonderful sound.</p>



<p>Previous note: I will not study the lyrics because I am more interested in melody, harmony, and rhythm at the moment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Stevie Wonder - Overjoyed ((Live in Japan))" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11kOx3xcX-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The song begins with a piano and guitar accompanied by strange sounds. Stevie Wonder refers to it as Environmental Percussion, and it consists of natural noises such as birds, crushed leaves, and stones dropped in a pond (Harrington, 1985). In fact, these water drops can be found throughout the song in the backbeat.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell which key the music starts in since it goes from C# Major 6 to C7 to B Major 7 and then back to C7. It repeats once again, but instead of going up in the last chord, it goes down to Bb.</p>



<p>This intro is such an odd way to begin a song because it doesn&#8217;t really inform you what to anticipate. When the line is descending, the listener expects it to continue descending, but the chords rise, and when it repeats, the expectation is that it will rise in the last chord, but it continues to descend. This up and down uncertainty, as well as the sounds of nature, distinguishes this song from many others.</p>



<p>When the verse begins, the chords and voice shift to Eb, the song&#8217;s key. The final Bb chord of the intro now makes sense because it is the dominant of the Eb.</p>



<p>The verse is an I-vi-ii-V progression, which is quite common, and the vocal melody is also quite simple. With such an odd beginning, you wouldn&#8217;t expect such a straightforward but wonderful verse.</p>



<p>One thing I realized is that if you listen closely to Steve&#8217;s vocal melody, he begins slightly before the rhythm, as shown in the example below. This syncopation is a subtle but crucial rhythm decision in my opinion. It appears that the singer is propelling the music ahead with vowels rather than consonants, as one might expect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="120" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1024x120.png" alt="" class="wp-image-402" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1024x120.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-300x35.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-768x90.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-1536x180.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-2048x239.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-640x75.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed-960x112.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/overjoyed.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When there is a repetition, Stevie Wonder goes to unexpected places, as he did in the intro. When the listener expects an ii (F minor) in the I-vi-ii-V progression in the second part of the verse, the music modulates to a C major scale, and the chords go to an F major 7 and then to a G major 7, and the B part of the verse begins in C major.</p>



<p>This game of not giving the listener what he expects is not new, but it works marvellously when it is effectively crafted.</p>



<p>When the listener expects a repetition in this B section of the verse, the music moves to another area. In this case, we expect to stay in the major key, but the third chord is a C minor, so the key shifts to a minor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="441" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1024x441.png" alt="" class="wp-image-403" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1024x441.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-300x129.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-768x331.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-1536x661.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-2048x882.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-640x276.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3-960x413.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-3.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Following the verse, the melody gracefully transitions to the chorus, with a chromatic rise to a new chord: Ab Major. The melody drops through G &#8211; F &#8211; Eb &#8211; D, which is on the Eb major scale, so I don&#8217;t believe the music modulates to a new key signature.</p>



<p>This chorus is particularly fascinating since the chords he uses to advance to the chorus are also used to decrease in the chorus. That&#8217;s intriguing because Stevie Wonder, once again, plays with the listener&#8217;s expectations. He went up with Bb &#8211; C -D &#8211; Eb &#8211; F -G then down with G &#8211; F &#8211; Eb &#8211; D, therefore the following note should be C, but instead, he changes the chorus to C#. It&#8217;s only for a moment, but it&#8217;s a pleasant surprise. But the surprise doesn&#8217;t stop there; the chorus modulates to a new key a whole tone above, creating a fantastic climax.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="603" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1024x603.png" alt="" class="wp-image-406" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1024x603.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-300x177.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-768x453.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-1536x905.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-2048x1207.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-640x377.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1-960x566.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled-4-1.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The song returns to the intro and the verse, but when the music moves to the chorus again, the melody begins in the A (just as it did in the second chorus). At this point, the listener may wonder if the chorus can get any higher. It does. Again, we modulate to a whole tone above, reaching the peak of the song.</p>



<p>As expected, the song culminates with the root note Eb after the chorus. There are no surprises at the end of the song.</p>



<p>I knew this song was beautifully crafted even before I analyzed it, but I had no idea it had so many details like the water sound, the syncopation in the verse, or the major/minor key modulations. I genuinely believe that this analysis helped me understand how to keep a song engaging without making it appear overly difficult.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A round is a musical composition in the form of a canon, and the melody is constructed in a way that produces a counterpoint when various performers or instruments begin it at different times. It is known as a &#8220;perpetual canon&#8221; since its ending works along with the opening.</p>



<p>I listened to dozens of rounds because they are typically easy and fun to listen to. I chose a few that appealed to me the most.</p>



<h3 id="the-great-bells-of-oseney">The Great Bells of Oseney</h3>



<p>This is a three-part round from 1609, but I couldn&#8217;t discover any further information about it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/deut9.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>This is a pretty simple round, but it&#8217;s useful to understand how three voices are used to produce triads most of the time, particularly in the first and end beats.</p>

<p>A three-part round in Hebrew from the 15th century that is frequently assigned to Johannes Ockeghem, despite the lack of strong evidence of that.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/havanashira.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The intriguing aspect of this round is that all voices have the identical note durations in the first two bars, resulting in a tremendous harmonizing sound. This pattern is disrupted in the third and fourth bars by the introduction of quavers, which creates a nice surprise.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="241" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-1024x241.png" alt="" class="wp-image-382" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-1024x241.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-300x71.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-768x181.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-1536x361.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-2048x482.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-640x151.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira-960x226.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hava-nashira.png 2364w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>A three-part round in the minor key that dates back to at least 1609.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/heyhonobody.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Typically, rounds are amusing or joyous songs, but this one is a lament sung in the D Minor scale. In contrast to the other rounds, this one employs a lot of quavers in between the chords, resulting in a more nuanced music. Another intriguing element is that the melody ends in the supertonic rather than the tonic, producing a sense of incompleteness and perpetualness.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="307" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-1024x307.png" alt="" class="wp-image-383" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-1024x307.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-300x90.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-768x231.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-640x192.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody-960x288.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nobody.png 1166w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>This is a popular Latin three-part round that is frequently assigned to Palestrina, however some contend that it was written by Mozart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/donanobis.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>What strikes me the most about this round is that, except the first two bars, all voices are really close together. They even end all three on the same note. When sang collectively, I believe this produces a more powerful sound, but I don&#8217;t believe the listener can follow the voices independently, which is one of the most interesting things in rounds.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="317" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-1024x317.png" alt="" class="wp-image-384" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-1024x317.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-300x93.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-768x238.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-640x198.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34-960x298.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-20-at-15.19.34.png 1258w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSCeV7WH2ms">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSCeV7WH2ms</a></p>



<p>This is a quick four-part round from 1609.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msmiller/images/joanglover.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>What I found remarkable about this round is the rhythm that all four voices repeat, almost always employing the triad. I think it&#8217;s incredibly danceable, and when sung in a group, it may make for a very energetic round.</p>

<p>This famous round is in A major for four voices by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="674" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57-1024x674.png" alt="" class="wp-image-389" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57-1024x674.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57-300x197.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57-768x505.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57-640x421.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57-960x632.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-21-at-10.17.57.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I was curious to hear a Mozart round, and I loved how he employed the Minims and crochets to keep the bass notes sustained. When listening to the melody with just one voice, it&#8217;s difficult to tell if there&#8217;s a top melody and a bass background, but when all voices are heard combined, it&#8217;s clear that there is.</p>

<p>Of course, I couldn&#8217;t leave Henry Purcell out of this round (pun intended).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D3TGowLoiPY/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>My favorite Purcell round was this one, which was humourous in style and delightful in how the voices sang &#8220;so kiss my arse&#8221; properly, accentuating each note with great force and confidence.</p>

<p>Although the majority of the examples I listened to were made more than a century ago, I remembered two instances from recent music that demonstrate that rounds are alive and well and may be employed in a modern context.</p>



<p>The most well-known is the final section of The Beach Boys&#8217; &#8211; God only knows. I recently watched Paul Mccartney&#8217;s documentary &#8220;McCartney 3, 2, 1,&#8221; in which he admits that Brian Wilson is one of his favorite harmony composers, and you can tell that this round is quite well composed.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Another song from the musical Rent that came to mind is &#8220;Will I?&#8221; from the musical Rent. Musicals, in my opinion, are a terrific platform for writing rounds because you can work with different vocal tones, portrayed by different characters, and so create a highly dynamic song.</p>

		<span>From what I knew just three months ago, I&#8217;m seeing remarkable development.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it if someone told me a few months ago that I&#8217;d be composing and notating a 2-minute solo piece. Three months ago, I was having difficulty reading music scores, using software like Sibelius, and understanding some musical concepts.   My tutor told me that it was normal and that I should expect a learning curve, but I had not anticipated making such rapid progress in such a short period of time.</p>



<p>I learned a lot about scales and, in particular, how melodies are made. I had a lot of fun analyzing everything from simple ancient melodies to more complicated and contemporary ones, which helped me with my Assignment 2 composition.</p>

<h3 id="about-assignment-2">About Assignment 2</h3>



<p>The assignment took far longer than I thought once again. According to the OCA assignment introduction, this should take about 3 hours, yet it took me about 3 days. Despite the amount of time it took me, I am quite pleased with the outcome. I was able to incorporate my idea for this work into the score, generating two contrasting parts for the two clarinet registers &#8211; chalumeau and clarion.</p>



<p>The four basic elements of music are rhythm, melody, harmony, and tone colour (Copland, Rich and Slatkin, 2011). Because this section of the course is about melody, I concentrated on the melodic rather than the rhythmic aspects of the piece. I wanted at least one memorable section of the tune that the listener would recognize immediately when it was repeated. With the main motif, I believe I was successful.</p>



<p>Although I liked creating for untuned percussion, I must say that composing for a pitched instrument was far more enjoyable. However, I must admit that the rhythm aspect was crucial, particularly in terms of not being stuck with a time signature or employing pauses as rhythmic alterations.</p>



<p>On the downside, I believe I could improve some aspects of my composition. I think the music sometimes goes to predictable places rather than surprising the listener with unexpected notes. In the next assignment, I must avoid this. I also believe I rushed several parts of the composition when the music needed to rest. Due to the 2-minute time limit, this was necessary.</p>



<p>Overall, I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing what my tutor thinks of this work and any ideas and adjustments he or she may have.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As part of the second assignment, I had to write a composition for a solo woodwind instrument that lasted between 1:30 and 2 minutes. The challenge of this composition is that I can use whichever scale I choose (it can be more than one scale), to take advantage of the instrument&#8217;s specific features and to respect its range.</p>



<p>You can find the final score <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=119PoSR35LbSVWA-Gnx6kXQBo5EyIMBrI" data-type="URL" data-id="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=119PoSR35LbSVWA-Gnx6kXQBo5EyIMBrI" target="_blank">here</a> and listen to it below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Assignment-2.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>Just like in the first assignment, I thought it was beneficial to create an outline and get an idea of what I was trying to accomplish beforehand. Though it may seem counterproductive at first, the structure and the idea helped me stay focused and keep a coherent thought process.</p>



<h2 id="the-idea-theme" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1631516667878 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Idea / Theme</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>This piece will centre around a character that is mournful during the workweek and eccentric on the weekend. In a routine and boring job, weekdays become monotonous and boring, while weekends become exciting and fun.</p>



<p>Usually on Mondays you feel melancholy, Tuesday through Thursday are monotonous and regretful, followed by Friday and Saturday with euphoria, and finally Sunday turns slowly into melancholy again and you&#8217;re back on Monday.</p>



<h2 id="the-structure" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1631516674208 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Structure</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>As soon as I had the idea, the structure made sense to me. First, there is an intro, followed by the main theme, and then there is a happy section. Revert to the main motif before ending the same way it began.</p>



<p>For the first two parts, the tempo would be slow, followed by a fast tempo for the third part, and then slowly decreasing for the final two parts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular cnvs-block-core-table-1628498574118"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The week starts slowly and melancholic</td><td>A</td><td><meta charset="utf-8">~40 seconds at ~50 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>The rest of the week is mournful</td><td>B</td><td><meta charset="utf-8">~40 seconds at <meta charset="utf-8">~50 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>It&#8217;s the weekend!

<h2 id="the-motifs" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1631516680946 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>The Motifs</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>My process for composing a motif was to play simple lines on the piano and to find one that sounds right to me. Inspiration overcame transpiration in this case. After some time, I began playing these four notes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="360" height="208" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.13.05.png" alt="" class="wp-image-350" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.13.05.png 360w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.13.05-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></figure>



<p>In spite of the simplicity of the melody, I liked the quaver/crochet rhythm, which gave me a sense of lull and monotony that I felt was appropriate for the B part. Although it feels like it is going up, it lacks the strength to stay up and goes down. Likewise, our character longs for the energy to accomplish something but returns to mourning.</p>



<p>After that, I discovered that the scale I wanted to work on would be the E harmonic minor, with the seventh diminished, which sounds exotic but at the same time lamenting.</p>



<p>The A part of the song has a similar motif to the B part, but to me, it feels more nostalgic, like someone is remembering the good old days (like the weekend).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="410" height="236" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.12.33.png" alt="" class="wp-image-351" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.12.33.png 410w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-14-at-12.12.33-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></figure>



<p>Because the C part is festive, I knew right away that I needed to change the scale, but not by much because the character remains the same and I didn&#8217;t want to have a big contrast. I chose to use the Ukrainian minor scale in the key of C, which is one of the most widely used scales in Klezmer music. As I worked with this scale, I realized these are exactly the notes of the G harmonic minor scale. I found this scale very festive even though it is a minor scale, which goes against the common idea that minor scales are sad.</p>

<p>In the C part of the song, the motif is made up of quavers and semiquavers, enjoying the wonderful staccato the clarinet can produce.</p>

<p>The clarinet is extremely versatile, and that&#8217;s why I chose it. With this piece, I wanted to push myself to explore both low and high registers while maintaining a cohesive line throughout. Clarinets have the broadest range of all woodwinds and can easily transition from <em>pianissimo</em> to <em>fortissimo</em> (Adler, 2002).</p>



<p>My research on the clarinet led me to these videos from Josh Plotner which explain, among other things, that the composer should avoid the Throat Tones register (from G4 to Bb4) due to its hollowness and weak sound. Although I tried to avoid these notes, it was difficult for me to eliminate them from the melody.</p>



<p>In the videos, it is also explained to avoid flutter tongue and use growl instead, since it sounds better.</p>

<p>It is also advised to avoid the transition between B4 and Bb4, referred to as &#8220;the break,&#8221; due to its difficult transition that only experienced players can handle (Adler, 2002).</p>

		<span>The Composition</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p><strong>Part A</strong> Bars 1-9</p>



<p>This section serves as a brief introduction and presents the first motif. The purpose of this section is to show the listener that the melody will stay in the Chalumeau register.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 1-4 are slow notes establishing the scale</li><li>Bars 5-9 are the part A motif followed by a descending to end this part</li></ul>



<p><strong>Part B</strong> Bars 10-19</p>



<p>While the tempo remains the same, the time signature switches to 3/4 here, and the dynamics increase. As a result, the listener can feel the character&#8217;s discomfort and lament.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 10-11 the main motif is presented and raised by one step</li><li>Bars 12-13 a variation of the motif going down and ending in the 5th</li><li>Bar 14 is a variation of the main motif</li><li>Bar 15 is a repetition of bar 11</li><li>Bar 16 is similar to bar 11 but with the extra QUAVER</li><li>Bars 17-19 the melody descends ending with a trill to the tonic</li></ul>



<p><strong>Part C</strong> Bars 20-43</p>



<p>In contrast to the previous two, this is the fastest section. Here, glissandos and growls are used to convey the feel of the parties and the exuberance of the weekend concept.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bar 20 is a scale run ascending over two octaves</li><li>Bar 21-22 a glissando sustained and played fortissimo</li><li>Bars 23-24 a crescendo in dynamics and offbeat notes</li><li>Bars 25-27 is the part C motif and its variations</li><li>Bar 28 the triplets are descending</li><li>Bars 29-30 are another variation of the motif</li><li>Bars 31-32 is the repetition of the same note in the semiquaver/quaver rhythm, ending in a flutter tongue in the highest E</li><li>Bars 33-34 are a variation of the motif</li><li>Bars 35-39 the quavers are used with the staccato</li><li>Bars 40-43 are a descending of crochets with quavers in between</li></ul>



<p><strong>Part B&#8217;</strong> Bars 44-51</p>



<p>The B part is shortened here, leading the listener slowly from the party of the C section to the end. Dynamic returns to <em>piano</em>.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 44-47 return to the harmonic scale and to the crochet/quaver rhtyhm</li><li>Bars 48-51 are the main motif with a few variations</li></ul>



<p><strong>Part A&#8217;</strong> Bars 52-58</p>



<p>While this section is slower than the previous one, it is similar to the introduction, ending in the same note as it began, giving it the appearance of being forever looped.</p>



<ul id="block-ad39ec09-be8d-4cce-993a-7a3c6c802173" class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 52-55 are similar to bars 5-7 but in a 3/4 time signature</li><li>Bar 56 is made entirely of crochets</li><li>Bars 57-58 a little pause to breathe into the instrument and realising the final two notes</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I do not intend to conduct in-depth analyses of these solo compositions, but rather to concentrate on how the composers wrote for that unique instrument. What techniques they employed, and how they attained various tonalities and colours in relation to each instrument.</p>



<h2 id="flute">Flute</h2>



<h5 id="claude-debussy-syrinx">Claude Debussy &#8211; Syrinx</h5>



<p>Due to the fact that it is likely the first flute solo piece written since the baroque period, Syrinx is one of the most important pieces written for flute solo. More composers were motivated to create for the unaccompanied flute as a result of this (Lee, 2018).</p>



<p>This composition, as well as the growing interest in the flute as a solo instrument, is thought to be attributable to advancements in the instrument, which allowed for new methods and sound colour. Indeed, Debussy explores the flute&#8217;s various tonalities and ranges. Consider the motif in the first bar, which is played in a high range with <em>mezzo-forte</em>.</p>

<p>The same motif is repeated, but in a lower range and <em>piano</em>, giving the piece a darker feel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="179" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-1024x179.png" alt="" class="wp-image-334" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-1024x179.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-300x52.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-768x134.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-1536x268.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-640x112.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55-960x167.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.16.55.png 1606w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Debussy uses the flute&#8217;s many ranges, travelling from C4 to E6 with multiple wave-like movements, creating a hypnotic sound.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="209" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-1024x209.png" alt="" class="wp-image-336" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-1024x209.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-300x61.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-768x156.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-1536x313.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-640x130.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32-960x196.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.32.32.png 1590w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s fascinating to hear Debussy move from the piece&#8217;s climax to its conclusion using an almost all direct descending line in the final section of Syrinx. At the same time, he goes from a <em>mezzo-forte</em> to a <em>piano</em>. This demonstrates how the flute may go from a loud and detailed high note, suited for demisemiquavers, to a very low register that is calmer, darker, and more sustained.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="784" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-1024x784.png" alt="" class="wp-image-335" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-1024x784.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-300x230.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-768x588.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-1536x1176.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-640x490.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54-960x735.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-12.19.54.png 1594w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 id="oboe">Oboe</h2>



<h5 id="gordon-jacob-seven-bagatelles">Gordon Jacob &#8211; Seven Bagatelles</h5>



<p>Gordon Jacob composed seven short solo oboe compositions. The works are all fairly different, demonstrating the oboe&#8217;s tonal versatility as a solo instrument.</p>



<p>The oboe&#8217;s ability to play a mixture of legato and staccato phrases in a light bouncy style, like in 5 &#8211; Limerick, is one example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="958" height="324" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54.png" alt="" class="wp-image-337" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54.png 958w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54-300x101.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54-768x260.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.41.54-640x216.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></figure>



<p>In 4 &#8211; Slow Air, Jacob also explores the prolonged notes as well as the various dynamics that sound lethargic or sorrowful.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="816" height="366" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.44.34.png" alt="" class="wp-image-338" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.44.34.png 816w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.44.34-300x135.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.44.34-768x344.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-13.44.34-640x287.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /></figure>



<p>The 2 &#8211; Elegy explores the melody lines that fit the oboe so well, as well as the big intervals that provide a wonderful contrast, especially in the high registers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="158" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-1024x158.png" alt="" class="wp-image-339" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-1024x158.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-300x46.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-768x118.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-1536x236.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-640x99.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-960x148.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36-1920x298.png 1920w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.36.36.png 1936w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The oboe&#8217;s melodic quality is also evident in the 6 &#8211; Chinese Tune, which employs the pentatonic scale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="736" height="284" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.42.35.png" alt="" class="wp-image-340" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.42.35.png 736w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.42.35-300x116.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.42.35-640x247.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></figure>



<p>The potential of the oboe to handle rather large leaps (Adler, 2002) is explored in various pieces, with the 3 &#8211; Waltz being one of them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="556" height="274" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.45.34.png" alt="" class="wp-image-341" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.45.34.png 556w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-10-at-14.45.34-300x148.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></figure>



<h2 id="saxophone">Saxophone</h2>



<h5 id="paul-creston-sonata-for-alto-saxophone-and-piano-op-19">Paul Creston &#8211; Sonata for Alto Saxophone and Piano, Op. 19</h5>



<p>I looked for a version of the saxophone solo as suggested, but all I found was the sonata accompanied by the piano. I&#8217;m not sure if this is the only version of the sonata available.</p>



<p>Before researching for this piece, I had never heard of Paul Creston, and I was pleased to learn that he was glad to create for often-overlooked instruments (Watanabe, 2011). Indeed, there were not many works dedicated to the saxophone in the 1930s, when this sonata was written (Mauk, 2015), therefore I was intrigued to learn what specific aspects he wrote for this instrument.</p>



<p>This work is structured into three movements, each of which is different. He begins with a jazzy opening, then transitions to a slower second movement before concluding with a more rhythmic movement. This demonstrates a saxophone&#8217;s adaptability, which I thought noteworthy.</p>



<p>One thing I observed in the first movement is the tempo shifts, which go from a fast <meta charset="utf-8">♩=126 “With vigor” to a calming in bar 10 and then a rise in bar 17. These changes are ideal for the saxophone, which can gracefully handle both slow and quick shifts.</p>

<p>The dynamics of the saxophone in this tune are one of the most noticeable variances. It has a wide range of dynamics, similar to the clarinet, and in this composition, it ranges from pianissimo to fortissimo. However, in contrast to the clarinet, I found the pianissimo not so soft and the fortissimo a little to bright. I&#8217;m curious how these dynamic shifts would function in a woodwind ensemble.</p>



<p>The second movement is a little more serene, with long notes that are representative of what one would expect from a saxophone. This movement surprised me least despite being extremely melodic and almost singable.</p>



<p>The third movement, on the other hand, surprised me the most, especially because I wasn&#8217;t expecting to hear the saxophone play such a rhythmic role. The saxophone sounds incredibly expressive and almost danceable in this passage, from the main theme to the staccato followed by the marcato.</p>

<h2 id="bassoon">Bassoon</h2>



<h5 id="willson-osborne-rhapsody-for-bassoon">Willson Osborne &#8211; Rhapsody for Bassoon</h5>



<p>Just one thing to mention: the C.F. Peters Corp edition of this score has beautiful lettering.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FTWQ30DqL.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="402"/></figure>



<p>My previous perception of the bassoon was that it is a very melancholy instrument. Wilson Osborne did not mislead me.</p>



<p>Slow parts are no problem for the bassoon, but what amazed me the most was how beautifully the quick runs worked. Osborne was able to arrange it in a very melodious manner, demonstrating the bassoon&#8217;s versatility.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="517" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-1024x517.png" alt="" class="wp-image-368" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-1024x517.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-300x152.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-768x388.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-1536x776.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-2048x1034.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-640x323.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17-960x485.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.40.17.png 2356w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The bassoon is a fantastic solo instrument in all registers, but when it&#8217;s accompanied, it gets swallowed up by the other instruments (Adler, 2002). That&#8217;s why Osborne presumably didn&#8217;t stick to the bassoon&#8217;s lower registers, opting instead to use the higher register, which is thin yet expressive.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="311" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-1024x311.png" alt="" class="wp-image-369" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-1024x311.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-300x91.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-768x233.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-1536x466.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-640x194.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53-960x291.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-12.58.53.png 1582w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Because the bassoon can&#8217;t handle forceful blows, it&#8217;s not surprising that Osborne didn&#8217;t go over <em>forte</em> in terms of dynamics.</p>



<p>The relative lack of rests was the last thing I noticed that I wasn&#8217;t anticipating. The bassoonist, in my opinion, would benefit from more breathing time and lengthier breaks. But I don&#8217;t believe Osborne agreed.</p>

<p>In my second assignment and Alan Hovhaness&#8217;s analysis, I do further research on the clarinet.</p>

		<span>What makes a happy melody?</span>

</h2>



<p>I was listening to music on Spotify on shuffle when Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro came on, and I had a thought: why do I feel happy every time I hear this song, particularly the chorus? I&#8217;ll try to figure it out by examining its melody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Tim Maia - Não Quero Dinheiro(Só quero amar) in Enlgish &amp; PT-BR" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOlLs6D7BpU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Tim Maia was a Brazilian musician who is regarded as one of the country&#8217;s most influential musicians. Maia pioneered sambalanço with Jorge Ben, a genre that combines samba, soul, funk, and rock and roll.</p>



<p>In 1971, he recorded Não Quero Dinheiro, a samba/soul song in which he declares, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any money, I just want love,&#8221; in response to rising consumerism. It&#8217;s a love song that&#8217;s likely influenced by the peace and love movement of the 1960s. The song went on to become a great success. Note that Brazil was under a dictatorship at the time, and this style of music was used as an escape from oppression.</p>



<p>This song catches my attention because of its general cheerfulness and happiness just by listening to it. This is, in my opinion, to do with repetition, syncopation, and tension.</p>



<p>The song begins with a syncopated melody that is repeated twice before the variation. This is the song&#8217;s verse, and while the tone is lively, it does not reach the climax of the chorus.</p>

<p>The chorus is the most joyful element of the song, but Tim Maia&#8217;s creation of a hymn with only three notes is even more astounding. And I believe that repetition is the key. In the first part of the chorus, the A is repeated 32 times.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="238" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1024x238.png" alt="" class="wp-image-328" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1024x238.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-768x178.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-1536x357.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-2048x476.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-640x149.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001-960x223.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/untitled_0001.png 2187w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>First part of the chorus of <meta charset="utf-8">Tim Maia&#8217;s Não Quero Dinheiro</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you listen to this melody alone, especially on the piano, you&#8217;ll hear almost a childlike repetition. As if a child was trying to prove she was better than others. It seems like you might be able to sing &#8220;My toy is better than yours&#8221; in this melody.</p>



<p>This chorus is also characterized by tension. The song repeats itself six times, creating tension, with the hope of resolution which comes in half of the seventh bar. The repetition-tension-resolution game continues throughout the entire melody.</p>



<p>I was delighted to discover this Ted Talk about music repetition by Elizabeth Margulis, Professor and Director of Princeton University&#8217;s Music Cognition Lab.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, repetition makes you feel that music is more enjoyable, more interesting and more human. Music critics, according to Margulis, are often embarrassed by repetition, believing it to be childish or regressive; but repetition, far from being embarrassing, helps us to think of music as a way of seeing the world.</p>



<p>Not to be forgotten is Beethoven&#8217;s repeated four-note theme in his Symphony No. 5 or Ravel&#8217;s Bolero, which is composed entirely of variations on a single motif.</p>



<p>Finally, in my opinion, what makes this melody feel happy and cheery is the same childish repetition that reminds you of a period when life was simple and happy, and all you cared about was playing and being happy. And those joyful memories are made up of repeated memories.</p>

		<span>I&#8217;ve learned that I&#8217;ve always liked counterpoint.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>My tutor encouraged me to add research in my log on terminology that I wasn&#8217;t familiar with. So I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;d heard of counterpoint before, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what it meant. Therefore I decided to research it and in the process, I realized I began playing music due to the counterpoint.</p>



<p>To begin with, the basic definition of counterpoint is when at least two melodies are layered one on top of the other (Wood, 1932). Bach&#8217;s two-part Inventions (Taylor, 2012) are an example of such counterpoint:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="865" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-1024x865.png" alt="" class="wp-image-323" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-1024x865.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-300x253.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-768x649.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-640x540.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02-960x811.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-03-at-13.37.02.png 1376w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Although there are many examples of counterpoint, canons, and fugues in classical music, I was curious if it was applied in recent popular music.</p>



<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers were one of my favorite bands growing up, mainly because of Flea&#8217;s bass lines. That is why I decided to learn to play the bass. That was counterpoint working on rock music, I had no idea. And counterpoint was the reason I was so captivated with that band.</p>

<p>Queen was another band I grew up admiring, and Freddy Mercury and Brian May were masters of counterpoint. In this Killer Queen example, notice how the guitar and backup vocals occasionally play their own melodies:</p>

<p>I looked into other examples and realized that, while not being a band I normally listen to, Radiohead used a lot of counterpoints in their music, which made me enjoy them far more. For example, just listening to the melody of the trombone in their song Life In A Glasshouse is lovely.</p>

<p>And, since it&#8217;s Friday, here&#8217;s one more example of how the guitar, in addition to the vocal melody and band harmony, plays its own melody. The guitar is isolated in this example because I believe it is simpler to understand the melody of the guitar, and anyone who knows the song can place the voice melody on top without listening to it.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that my reflection on the counterpoint in this piece is superficial, and that thousands of pages have been written about it, but it has helped me to better comprehend the concept and develop it in my future work.</p>

<p>The goal of this project was to write nine woodwind pieces in nine distinct scales.</p>



<h5 id="1-whole-tone-scale">1 &#8211; Whole tone scale</h5>



<p>This scale appealed to me as mysterious and incomplete, which is why I abruptly ended this melody. Because the flute gives a light, airy, bright, and rich sound that matches this song, I used it in the middle register.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="456" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-1024x456.png" alt="" class="wp-image-296" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-1024x456.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-300x134.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-768x342.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-1536x684.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2048x912.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-640x285.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-960x428.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001.png 2077w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="2-whole-tone-scale">2 &#8211; Whole-tone scale</h5>



<p>This is another melody I&#8217;ve kept incomplete because I get the feeling of doubt when hearing the whole-tone scale. I picked up the alto saxophone for this exercise mostly out of curiosity. If used softly in the lower register, it can transmit a melancholic sound, but when played faster and in the upper register, it can sound hard and clear.</p>

<h5 id="3-east-european-major-scale">3 &#8211; East European major scale</h5>



<p>With significant leaps (3 semitones) between the 2nd and 3rd, and the 6th and 7th, this scale in major sounds quite celebratory. The bassoon, especially with the staccato, is perfectly suited for humorous sound. That&#8217;s why I tried to include it into the melody&#8217;s opening section.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="356" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1024x356.png" alt="" class="wp-image-301" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1024x356.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-300x104.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-768x267.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-1536x534.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-2048x711.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-640x222.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2-960x333.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0001-2.png 2116w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7-2.mp3"></audio></figure>



<h5 id="4-east-european-minor-scale">4 &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">East European minor scale</h5>



<p>This scale, on the other hand, has a sorrowful and melancholy tone to it. I avoided choosing instruments that could communicate grief, such as the clarinet, and instead focused on the flute&#8217;s middle and low registers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="370" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-1024x370.png" alt="" class="wp-image-304" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-1024x370.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-300x108.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-768x278.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-1536x555.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-2048x741.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-640x231.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002-960x347.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0002.png 2077w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h5 id="5-middle-eastern-eight-note-scale">5 &#8211; Middle Eastern eight-note scale</h5>



<p>Due to the presence of numerous semitones, this scale sounded quite mysterious. Because of its dark timbre, I chose the contrabassoon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="207" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-1024x207.png" alt="" class="wp-image-306" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-1024x207.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-300x61.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-768x155.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-1536x310.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-2048x414.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-640x129.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006-960x194.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0006.png 2147w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7-7.mp3"></audio></figure>



<h5 id="6-middle-eastern-eight-note-scale">6 &#8211; <meta charset="utf-8">Middle Eastern eight-note scale</h5>



<p>This song maintains the mystery nature of the scale, but I attempted to give it a more Middle Eastern flavor. In its middle range, the oboe was ideal for what I was seeking for.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="203" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-1024x203.png" alt="" class="wp-image-308" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-1024x203.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-300x60.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-768x152.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-1536x305.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-2048x406.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-640x127.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003-960x191.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Project-7_0003.png 2101w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>The extra notes in this scale were used to create ornaments that are perfect for the piccolo. I ended up writing a pretty cheerful melody.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To compose melodies for woodwind instruments (Project 7), I first researched what types of instruments exist in the woodwind family, how to write for them, and what techniques they can achieve.</p>



<p>I found Samuel Adler&#8217;s book The Study of Orchestration to be an excellent resource for learning about orchestral instruments.</p>



<h2 id="classification" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1630378076466 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Classification</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Woodwind instruments are classified according to their families, reed type, pipe shape, intervals, and transposition (Adler, 2002). Classifying by family, in my opinion, makes more sense:</p>



<ol class="is-style-default"><li>The flute family &#8211; picollo, flute, alto flute, bass flute. The recorder is omitted since is not used in modern symphony orchestra (Adler, 2002).</li><li>The oboe family &#8211; oboe, oboe d&#8217;amour, English horn, hecklephone, bassoon, contrabassoon</li><li>The clarinet family &#8211; C, D, Eb, Bb, and A clarinets, alto clarinet (Eb), bass clarinet (generally in Bb, sometimes in Eb), contrabass clarinet (Bb or Eb), basset horn (F)</li><li>The saxophone family &#8211; sopranino (usually in Eb), soprano (Bb), alto (Eb), tenor (Bb), baritone (Eb), and bass saxophone (Bb) </li></ol>



<h2 id="transposition" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1630378089007 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Transposition</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>A transposing instrument generates pitches that aren&#8217;t the same as what&#8217;s on the page. <a href="http://www.orchestralibrary.com/reftables/rang.html#woodwinds" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.orchestralibrary.com/reftables/rang.html#woodwinds" target="_blank">This reference table, which I found on the website orchestralibrary.com</a>, is quite valuable because it includes not only the instrument range but also their transpositions.</p>



<p>The fundamental rule for all transposing instruments is that the written C will sound the instrument&#8217;s designated pitch. (2002, Adler)</p>



<h2 id="techniques" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1630379582051 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Techniques</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Woodwinds may generate a variety of techniques, and while it varies per instrument, most techniques are more difficult to manage in extreme registers than in middle registers (Adler, 2002).</p>



<h5 id="vibrato">Vibrato</h5>



<p>By default, the player can choose when to use vibrato, and the composer needs only to indicate <em>senza vibrato</em> or <em>non vibrato</em> if he does not want vibrato to be performed.</p>



<h5 id="tonguing-and-phrasing">Tonguing and phrasing</h5>



<p>A woodwind instrument&#8217;s articulations are affected by tonguing with a tuh-like or a duh-like sound. Unless there is a slur, notes are articulated separately and tongued. If there are slurs, notes are played in one breath with tongue only used on the first note. It is called legato.</p>



<h5 id="staccato">Staccato</h5>



<p>A dot above or below the note will produce a very short note with a natural separation between notes.</p>



<h5 id="soft-tonguing">Soft tonguing</h5>



<p>Soft tonguing is represented by slurs written in notes with dots or slashes. It has the same impact as slurred staccato.</p>



<h5 id="double-tonguing">Double tonguing</h5>



<p>In quick passages, double tonguing is used to produce a sound similar to te ke.</p>



<h5 id="dynamic-envelopes">Dynamic envelopes</h5>



<p>Moving from a strong attack to a lower volume and then back up to a higher level creates a powerful effect. Although woodwinds are not the only instruments that can achieve this effect, they are the greatest at it.</p>



<h5 id="flutter-tongue">Flutter tongue</h5>



<p>This effect creates a rolled <em>r</em> sound, which is common in woodwind instruments. Except for oboes and bassoons, it&#8217;s simple to play on most instruments. To create the optimum sound, the flutter tongue may require extended notes or complete passages. <em>Flutter tongue</em> or <em>flatterzunge</em> must be noted above the passage in the score.</p>



<h5 id="other-special-effects">Other special effects</h5>



<p>Multiphonics, when an instrument produces more than a note.</p>



<p>Glissandi, can be used in the upward direction, especially in clarinet and saxophone.</p>



<p>Slap tonguing produces a perky and snappy attack.</p>



<p>Key clicking, when the player slaps the notes without blowing air.</p>



<p>Whistle tones, when the player turns the instrument far from the face and blows across it.</p>



<p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The purpose of project 6 is to examine at least two solo wind instrument works from a provided list. It is recommended to keep the following observations in mind:</p>

		<span>Jacques Ibert – Pièce for flute alone</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>This work, written in 1936, was influenced by the movement started by&nbsp;Debussy&#8217;s Syrinx, to&nbsp;write&nbsp;for flute without accompaniment (Lee, 2018). Flute pieces were not very prevalent during the baroque era as solo instrument.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until the instrument&#8217;s development around the turn of the XX&nbsp;century that a large number of flute players emerged and began commissioning new works for the instrument. (Toff,&nbsp;2012). Pièce for solo flute by Jaques Ibert was written for the French flautist Marcel Moyse.</p>

<p>This piece&#8217;s theme appeals to me much. It&#8217;s actually really simple. The supertonic and tonic dotted crochets are followed by six quavers, all in the Db scale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="724" height="168" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png" alt="" class="wp-image-267" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36.png 724w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-300x70.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-25-at-13.54.36-640x149.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure>



<p>I find this theme particularly appealing because these two notes work together like a sigh. The supertonic represents an inhale and the tonic represents a exhale. Since this piece was written in 1937, between the two great wars, I would say that its motif captures both the hope and disbelief of humanity. Are we going to be at war again? Perhaps not. Inhale. Or most likely, yes. Exhale. After these two notes, there is an answer to the question. Occasionally, they are optimistic and go up (bars 25 and 26), but they are usually pessimistic and go down.</p>



<p>There are 4 parts to this piece: Introduction &#8211; Part A &#8211; Part B &#8211; Part A&#8217;.</p>



<h2 id="introduction" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876025605 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Introduction</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The work begins with a gradual but increasing repetition of D, eventually developing to a quicker sequence of semiquavers and demisemiquavers. This introduction includes a rhythmic portion as well as a wide range of notes that demonstrate the flute&#8217;s tonal diversity. D4 to D6. It culminates in an ascension that leads to the main theme.</p>



<h2 id="part-a" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875870212 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The theme is presented and repeated to establish that this will be a recurring motif in all music and that the listener will remember it. Following that, Ibert interacts with the theme and cadence, frequently ending in surprising notes. It continues until bar 34, when it returns to the original theme but briefly switches to the Gb scale before returning to the D. The question (are we going to be at war?) is left unresolved at the end of this section.</p>



<h2 id="part-b" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629876008964 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part B</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Part A is disrupted by this section. It momentarily switches to 9/8 time signature before switching to 3/4 &#8211; 2/4. There&#8217;s also a wave-like tune that conveys some anxiousness and unease. This is also sensed as we transition from a major to a minor scale. It&#8217;s the song&#8217;s most energizing section.</p>



<h2 id="part-a-2" class="cnvs-block-section-heading cnvs-block-section-heading-1629875998799 halignleft" >
	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Part A&#8217;</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>We return to the motif, but this time raised an octave. I believe that the composer needed to bring the listener back to the familiarity of the theme without losing the rush because we just came from such an exciting section. The melody then returns to its original octave, bringing us back home. We keep the sigh, just like we did at the start because the music provides no answers to the initial inquiry. Inhale, then exhale. And the piece ends in Db, which is a semitone below the composition&#8217;s starting note. The Db is repeated in the last bar, but two octaves lower. I don&#8217;t think it contributes anything to the finish and, in my opinion, should be omitted, just as Moyse did in the performance above.</p>



<p>When I started researching for this piece, I discovered that this is one of the most popular pieces among flute students. I&#8217;m beginning to see why. Ibert demonstrates the flute&#8217;s versatility throughout these 5 minutes of music, from trills to rapidly rising and falling scales, to the lovely two notes from the theme that, if performed effectively, can convey the optimism/pessimism duality that I believe the composer was attempting to portray.</p>

	<span class="cnvs-section-title">
		<span>Alan Hovhaness &#8211; Lament for Clarinet</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Hovhaness was an Armenian-American composer who lived in the United States. Although I can&#8217;t discover a backstory for the Lament for Clarinet (1935), the Armenian exodus is a central motif in his Exile Symphony, which was written a year later (1936). (Athens, 2016). As a result, it&#8217;s plausible to assume that this sombre work was influenced by the Armenian situation in the United States and around the world.</p>

<p>This piece doesn&#8217;t appear to have a rigid structure, except for the main theme in bar 23 that is repeated with variations several times. There is also a motif featured at the beginning of the piece and repeated intermittently throughout.</p>



<p>The main theme consists of a fast rise from F to C, which is then sustained for nearly a full bar. Then there&#8217;s a quaver-crochet pattern that creates the impression that the character is walking or moving, but extremely slowly, as if dragging something, like a great pain.</p>

<p>The first notes, in my opinion, do an excellent job of portraying the composer&#8217;s grief. It reminds me of Sodade, a song by Cape Verdean singer Cesária Évora. It&#8217;s also a lament for her hometown, which she misses. The chorus&#8217;s initial two notes are a fast rise from G&nbsp;to C, akin to Hovaness&#8217; piece.</p>

<p>This informs me that the clarinet is excellent at resonating with the human voice, which I believe Hovaness was attempting to demonstrate in this piece. The clarinet sings a human grief.</p>



<p>This piece begins with a fast crescendo that demonstrates the clarinet&#8217;s vast range (F3 to C6). Everything slows down after this fast crescendo, with long sustained notes and a bend. I had no idea the clarinet could bend notes, which is fascinating to me. It has a lot of potentials to enhance mourning, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The composer then begins his exploration of the clarinet&#8217;s chalumeau register, with lower pitch notes, which, once again, is an excellent choice for passing the song&#8217;s sadness.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t figure out what scale the composer is using, although the majority of the notes picked sound exotic to me. I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s an Indian scale.</p>



<p>The theme is repeated four times, each time with slight modifications, but always ending on a lower pitch than when it began. It seems to be stating that no matter how hard the character tries to move up, it always ends up going down.</p>



<p>Then, with the reprise of the rising from the song&#8217;s beginning, there&#8217;s a ray of hope. A repetition of bars 19-21,  but again we return to a lower tone as if the character refuses to let go of his or her misery. Several times, hitting&nbsp;the same note, A.</p>



<p>We return to the main theme, always with the sadness of concluding on a lower tone than we began.</p>



<p>Here we begin a dialogue between hope and lament. Hope is a repetition of the preceding fast-rising, but this time it ascends to Db6, the highest note in all music. It&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s our character&#8217;s final hope, followed by a repeat of the first bar. Our character, on the other hand, gives up and plays the same notes for two bars.</p>



<p>Hopes responds by repeating the ascending to the highest tone. However, our character is slowly dying (the composer wrote the morendo in the score), with the semiquavers and crochets gradually fading to the low notes.</p>



<p>This composition struck me as very sad, and I believe that was the composer&#8217;s intention. Probably because of its history and all the stories he must have witnessed and experienced. Hovhaness was very familiar with the clarinet and its expressive possibilities (Wolverton, 2002), so it&#8217;s no surprise that this piece captures the melancholy and lament so beautifully.</p>



<p>As I previously stated, the clarinet has the ability to express human emotions, and when effectively crafted, it can feel as though there is a highly varied singer behind this instrument. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll remember this in my upcoming compositions.</p>

<p>One of the composers with whom I most identify is Claude Debussy. So when I stumbled across this piece when researching pentatonic scale melodies, I knew I&#8217;d like it. I was not mistaken.</p>

<p>My primary focus during this analysis will be on melody since that&#8217;s the component of the unit I&#8217;m studying.</p>



<p>This work, written by Claude Debussy between 1909 and 1910 for piano, was later transferred to a variety of other instruments.</p>



<p>The theme is introduced with a simple but lovely melodic line consisting entirely of Gb major pentatonic notes. I find this melody to be interesting because it ascends and descends in the pentatonic scale &#8212; in theory, that may sound boring, but it&#8217;s rather pleasing to listen to in this case.</p>



<p>The theme is then repeated, but instead of going up and down like the first time, we start descending the Gb scale in bar 10. This indicates that the music is going forward and not stuck in the same repetitive pattern, which should be uninteresting.</p>



<p>The work maintains its wave-like melody, but at bar 15, during one of the dramatic ascends, we switch to the Cb major pentatonic scale, reaching the highest note in the piece thus far. The melody then gradually descends in the Gb major scale, with the one quaver &#8211; two semiquavers that are so characteristic of this work, bringing familiarity and tranquillity to the music.</p>



<p>In bar 19, the score states &#8220;Un Peu Animé&#8221;, which I believe is the start of the song&#8217;s climax, where we ascend into three octaves in the scale of Eb Major and reach the highest note so far in the melody.</p>



<p>After the exhilaration of the finale, the primary theme returns, offering familiarity and security once more. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that this theme is a chord-based version of the familiar motif.</p>



<p>It all comes to a halt at bar 28 when the motif returns, but this time an octave higher. This gives the music a lot of tranquillity and a little dreaminess, in my opinion. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re reminiscing about how it all began. It&#8217;s also a little nostalgic.</p>



<p>In bar 33, we repeat bar 14, which brings us to the end of the song. The PP and minims make sure we reach a safe and stable conclusion.</p>



<p>Finally, I was drawn to this music since it is a singable melody that employs simple and common scales. This is the kind of melody I enjoy writing, and I&#8217;m hoping to get some inspiration from Debussy in Assignment 2.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C. This song from the eighteenth century piqued my curiosity, so I decided to investigate it more.</p>



<p>The lyrics are as follows, in their literal translation:</p>



<p>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>Sweet-smelling, beautiful, stems full of buds<br>Fragrant and white, everyone praises<br>Let me pluck you down<br>Give to someone else<br>Jasmine flower, oh jasmine flower</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When I first read this score, the slurs between two notes, going one tone up or down, gave it a very pleasant Chinese characteristic sound. It&#8217;s almost like a vocal slide that makes you feel either eager or peaceful depending on which direction you&#8217;re facing.</p>



<p>The song begins with a simple phrase that progresses from E to C, the song&#8217;s highest note, and then down to G. The song proceeds to a calmer section after the repetition of the first phrase, with mostly crochets and note repetition. It eventually descends to C, one octave lower than the highest C.</p>



<p>The last section is when the slur is used more frequently, most likely because the melody shifts from praising the jasmine blossom to taking it up and offering it to someone else. After ascending to the highest C, the song begins to descend to the lowest note, G. I believe the impression of falling down is achieved using this slurs going from E to lower G. It was strikingly beautiful to me.</p>



<p>I then went to Youtube to look for more versions of this song, and I came across this one by the Choir of St John&#8217;s College Cambridge, which I thought was the most fascinating arrangement.</p>
