<p>One of the composers with whom I most identify is Claude Debussy. So when I stumbled across this piece when researching pentatonic scale melodies, I knew I&#8217;d like it. I was not mistaken.</p>

<p>My primary focus during this analysis will be on melody since that&#8217;s the component of the unit I&#8217;m studying.</p>



<p>This work, written by Claude Debussy between 1909 and 1910 for piano, was later transferred to a variety of other instruments.</p>



<p>The theme is introduced with a simple but lovely melodic line consisting entirely of Gb major pentatonic notes. I find this melody to be interesting because it ascends and descends in the pentatonic scale &#8212; in theory, that may sound boring, but it&#8217;s rather pleasing to listen to in this case.</p>



<p>The theme is then repeated, but instead of going up and down like the first time, we start descending the Gb scale in bar 10. This indicates that the music is going forward and not stuck in the same repetitive pattern, which should be uninteresting.</p>



<p>The work maintains its wave-like melody, but at bar 15, during one of the dramatic ascends, we switch to the Cb major pentatonic scale, reaching the highest note in the piece thus far. The melody then gradually descends in the Gb major scale, with the one quaver &#8211; two semiquavers that are so characteristic of this work, bringing familiarity and tranquillity to the music.</p>



<p>In bar 19, the score states &#8220;Un Peu Animé&#8221;, which I believe is the start of the song&#8217;s climax, where we ascend into three octaves in the scale of Eb Major and reach the highest note so far in the melody.</p>



<p>After the exhilaration of the finale, the primary theme returns, offering familiarity and security once more. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that this theme is a chord-based version of the familiar motif.</p>



<p>It all comes to a halt at bar 28 when the motif returns, but this time an octave higher. This gives the music a lot of tranquillity and a little dreaminess, in my opinion. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re reminiscing about how it all began. It&#8217;s also a little nostalgic.</p>



<p>In bar 33, we repeat bar 14, which brings us to the end of the song. The PP and minims make sure we reach a safe and stable conclusion.</p>



<p>Finally, I was drawn to this music since it is a singable melody that employs simple and common scales. This is the kind of melody I enjoy writing, and I&#8217;m hoping to get some inspiration from Debussy in Assignment 2.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While researching the pentatonic scale, I stumbled upon Mo Li Hua, a Chinese folk song written in C. This song from the eighteenth century piqued my curiosity, so I decided to investigate it more.</p>



<p>The lyrics are as follows, in their literal translation:</p>



<p>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>What a beautiful jasmine flower<br>Sweet-smelling, beautiful, stems full of buds<br>Fragrant and white, everyone praises<br>Let me pluck you down<br>Give to someone else<br>Jasmine flower, oh jasmine flower</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When I first read this score, the slurs between two notes, going one tone up or down, gave it a very pleasant Chinese characteristic sound. It&#8217;s almost like a vocal slide that makes you feel either eager or peaceful depending on which direction you&#8217;re facing.</p>



<p>The song begins with a simple phrase that progresses from E to C, the song&#8217;s highest note, and then down to G. The song proceeds to a calmer section after the repetition of the first phrase, with mostly crochets and note repetition. It eventually descends to C, one octave lower than the highest C.</p>



<p>The last section is when the slur is used more frequently, most likely because the melody shifts from praising the jasmine blossom to taking it up and offering it to someone else. After ascending to the highest C, the song begins to descend to the lowest note, G. I believe the impression of falling down is achieved using this slurs going from E to lower G. It was strikingly beautiful to me.</p>



<p>I then went to Youtube to look for more versions of this song, and I came across this one by the Choir of St John&#8217;s College Cambridge, which I thought was the most fascinating arrangement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The purpose of this project, which is part 2 of the program, is to compose three short contrasting melodies for vocals based on the pentatonic scale. To keep them engaging, it&#8217;s a good idea to be conscious of the dynamics, tempo, and rhythm.</p>

<p>I attempted to make things as simple as possible in my first exercise, concentrating mostly on the melody shape. It&#8217;s written in C, but I begin in E to add interest and to allow the melody to descend a little to lead the listener to the highest note in the melody.</p>

<p>I opted to develop an exercise with the F# pentatonic because it can be played on the piano&#8217;s black keys. It began to sound Chinese to me, so I went with it. It ended up having a straight melody shape, starting low, rising, going down, going higher, falling, going up a little and ending almost straight.</p>

<p>After hearing Debussy&#8217;s La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin, I was drawn to the main motif&#8217;s &#8220;wave&#8221; shape. I wanted to create a melody that resembled waves. I used the Bb pentatonic, but there&#8217;s a modulation to Eb in the middle, then back to Bb in the conclusion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="438" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-1024x438.png" alt="" class="wp-image-247" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-1024x438.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-300x128.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-768x328.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-1536x656.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-2048x875.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-640x273.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3-960x410.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Project-5-Pentatonic-Melody-3.png 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Finally, I believe that this effort helped me better comprehend the pentatonic scale&#8217;s possibilities and reinforce my knowledge of articulations from Taylor&#8217;s material.</p>

</h2>



<p>I must confess that, aside from knowing what the pentatonic scale was, I had no idea how important it was in music. I used to think it was a simple scale that was mostly used in nursery rhymes and was used as the first scale a novice learns.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that I was not mistaken, after viewing this incredible video by musician Anuja Kamat, I realized that the pentatonic scale is used all over the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>But why is the pentatonic scale employed by ancient civilizations and people all across the world? Mathematics and frequency are the keys to the solution. Because all notes have a straightforward relationship between them, as illustrated in the points below, all notes sound good. As a result, they appeal to everyone&#8217;s ears.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>tonic has whatever frequency&nbsp;you first chose</li><li>supertonic has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1⅛</li><li>mediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1¼</li><li>dominant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1½</li><li>submediant has the frequency of tonic multiplied by 1⅔</li><li>tonic (octave above) has the frequency of orginal tonic&nbsp;multiplied by 2</li></ul>



<p>The pentatonic scale appears in a variety of musical styles, which is fascinating. In the Chinese folk tune Mo Li Hua, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Jasmine_barrow.svg/2880px-Jasmine_barrow.svg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In the well-known Amazing Grace, for example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="96" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-1024x96.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-300x28.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-768x72.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-640x60.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-960x90.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image.png 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Hold On We&#8217;re Going Home by Drake is another song that uses the pentatonic scale, which is quite prevalent in pop music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="79" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1024x79.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-300x23.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-768x59.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-1536x119.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-2048x159.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-640x50.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1-960x74.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/untitled-2-1.png 2066w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It is also employed by classical composers. Debussy&#8217;s La Fille Aux Cheveux De Lin contains another melody based on the pentatonic scale (except for an F).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.teoria.com/res/images/articles/debussy-fille-aux-cheveux-des-lin/tema.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>It makes me wonder whether maybe the pentatonic scale is the so-coveted universal language. A common language shared by people from various places, cultures, and eras. Even if two persons from completely different cultures and musical backgrounds are brought together, they may agree that these five notes sound good. </p>



<p>This Bob McFerrin story exemplifies it perfectly.</p>

<p>Although I still believe the pentatonic scale is a simple scale, I now recognize its significance in music and the vast possibilities it offers. I&#8217;m going to use them in the pentatonic scale melody project I&#8217;m working on.</p>

<p>Prior to this, I had never written music in notation, had no experience with Sibelius, and my only understanding of percussion instruments was limited to those found in a rock drum kit.</p>



<p>During these two months, I read various books and watched videos to better grasp how to notate music, how to listen to music, and how different instruments sound. Among my sources are:</p>

		<span>About Assignment 1</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Following the finishing of the composition, I&#8217;m quite satisfied with the outcome, despite the fact that it took me longer than I anticipated. But I have to admit that making a plan ahead of time helped me stay focused and save time. This is an important lesson to remember for future projects.</p>



<p>As with all challenges, there were some parts that were easier than others.</p>



<p>Because of my professional background, I found the narrative section to be the most straightforward to write, therefore it was the first thing I did. Another thing that came naturally to me was writing themes depending on the story I wanted to tell.</p>



<p>Working with unpitched instruments was the most difficult part for me, and I often felt like I needed a pitched instrument to make a melody. Along the way, I discovered that employing various sounding percussion instruments might help in the creation of a melody. That&#8217;s what I sought to achieve with my composition.</p>



<p>Another challenge I faced was figuring out how to use the rests. Mostly, because most percussion instruments have such a short decay that the note&#8217;s duration is irrelevant and should be stated in an easy-to-read notation (Blatter and Blatter, 1997). I tried to make it simple for the players to read the rests by using the strong beat.</p>



<p>Overall, my ability to construct a 2-minute composition exceeded my expectations. The use of the variable meter has especially&nbsp;impressed me. I found it really beneficial in transmitting the devils&#8217; sense of disorder, and I ended up using it a lot more than I expected. On the other side, I believe I could do a better job of not using too many notes, or complicating things too much.</p>



<p>The key takeaway from this composition is that creating music in notation allows me to think more slowly about each section of the song and to delve deeper into each particular instrument.</p>



<p>As I previously stated, this was my first time using just percussion and non-pitched instruments, and my aim is that it will provide me with the foundations to write with a variety of instruments, specially tuned ones.</p>

		<span>Assignment 1: A composition for a group of untuned percussion</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>The first assignment&#8217;s brief is really exciting: to complete an unfinished ballet score called Wild Dance, of which only the first 14 bars have been completed and the sole indication is: Curtain rises &#8211; enter a group of demons. The goal is to create a complete composition with unpitched percussion that lasts between 2 and 3 minutes.</p>



<p>I looked deeper into the composition and made a few tweaks to the concept after<a href="/project-4-about-structure/" data-type="URL" data-id="/project-4-about-structure/" target="_blank"> the plan I developed in Project 4</a>. The most notable difference is in the narrative, which has an impact on the structure.</p>



<p>You can find the score <a href="https://bit.ly/pedroassignment1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://bit.ly/pedroassignment1" target="_blank">here</a> and listen to it below:</p>

<p>Do you know how you feel when you&#8217;re about to do something that makes you uncomfortable? Maybe the first time you kissed a person you loved? Or when you&#8217;re taking an exam that you haven&#8217;t prepared for? Or every time you perform in front of a large crowd?</p>



<p>A lot of things happen in your head: adrenaline rushes, you feel dizzy, and your mind is filled with conflicting thoughts. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; &#8220;What if everything goes wrong?&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m not prepared,&#8221; &#8220;I think I can do it!&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221;<br>Inside your head, it&#8217;s like a war between demons and angels.</p>



<p>This is the subject of this piece. Sometimes the angels prevail, and other times your anxieties triumph. Demons win in this one.</p>

<p>I constructed a structure for the piece using the &#8220;Wild Dance&#8221; as a starting point, with the form: A B C B&#8217; A&#8217;.</p>

		<span>Composition</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p><strong>Part A</strong> Bars 1 &#8211; 30</p>



<p>This section serves as an introduction, introducing the demons. I decided to keep the provided piece and extend it until the 30th Bar. The provided score begins with a motif that I utilized to introduce the demons. I used the same instruments as the demons: cymbals, tambourine, snare, and bass drum.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39.png" alt="" class="wp-image-188" width="234" height="291" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39.png 500w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39-241x300.png 241w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39-300x373.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px" /></figure>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 15-16 are the repetition of bars 3-4.</li><li>Bars 17-18 the tambourine is silenced for the first bar, and the 7/8 time signature is introduced to offer some variety to the dance.</li><li><meta charset="utf-8">Bars 19-20 are the repetition of bars 3-4.</li><li>Bar 21 the tambourine comes to a halt to give the rhythm a break.</li><li><meta charset="utf-8">Bars 22-23 are the repetition of bars 3-4.</li><li>Bars 24-26 the tambourine increases the strokes towards the end of the first part.</li><li>Bars 27-30 the bass drum and snare drum mimic each other until the end. </li></ul>



<p><strong>´</strong></p>



<p><strong>Part B </strong>Bars 31 &#8211; 77</p>



<p>Here we have the attack of the demons. Although the tempo is the same, the intensity is bigger with the snare having more prominence than in the introduction, giving the feeling of a faster section. I kept the variable meter from the introduction, as it passes the sense of nervousness. </p>



<p>I thought of an attack motif as an inversion of the time signature of the introduction, 3/8 &#8211; 5/8 instead of 5/8 &#8211; 3/8, to give some familiarity while maintaining the 3 2 3. This motif ends with a small pause since I want to give the listener the feeling of hesitation. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.18.43.png" alt="" class="wp-image-197" width="244" height="302" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.18.43.png 684w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.18.43-242x300.png 242w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.18.43-300x372.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.18.43-640x793.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></figure>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled has-regular-font-size"><li>Bar 31 the Part B starts with a wink to Part A, with the crescendo working as the launch of the attack. I repeat it several times to work as the launch of each attack. </li><li>Bars 32-41 the snare establishes the motif. </li><li>Bars 42-46 are the repetition of bars 31-35 with some modifications.</li><li>Bars 47-57 the tambourine substitutes the snare and derives from the motif.</li><li>Bars 58-67 the motif continues and the cymbal strikes more often, reaching the climax.</li><li>Bars 68-71 the first part of the motif is repeated to reach the climax and end the Part B</li><li>Bars 72-77 the ritardando is used to transmit the demons&#8217; tiredness and build a bridge to Part C, with the Tam-Tam and Bass Drum (Bar 76) ending it.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Part C</strong> Bars 78 &#8211; 98</p>



<p>Part C is devoted to the angels. This section contrasts with the previous ones by being slower and with fewer instrument strikes. I want the listener to breathe from the previous strikes and to prepare for the following ones. For the angels&#8217; instruments, I picked Finger Cymbals &#8211; Cabasa &#8211; Bongos &#8211; Bass Drum. The motif came after I watched the tremolo Finger Cymbal technique in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt6nyCLf45s" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt6nyCLf45s" target="_blank">this Zildjian video</a>. I liked how spacial it sounded. Then I thought that the cabasa would be a good fit for the Finger Cymbals, so I researched some playing techniques and ended up finding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAwVq2VbBbc" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAwVq2VbBbc" target="_blank">this video</a> showing the player hitting the cabasa and shaking it, which sounded perfect for me. The Bass drum provides the base rhythm and the Bongos provide the dance rhythm.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10.png" alt="" class="wp-image-199" width="253" height="298" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10.png 740w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10-254x300.png 254w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10-300x354.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-12-at-10.29.10-640x756.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" /></figure>



<p>The time signature is always 5/8 &#8211; 5/8 &#8211; 6/8 to keep it simple and predictable.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 78-80 establishes the motif, ending in a kind of delay sound for the cabasa.</li><li>Bars 81-94 are the repetition of the motif but with the bongos providing the danceable rhythm.</li><li>Bars 95-98 the repetition and the acceleration of the snare brings us a new attack, to the B&#8217; part.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Part B&#8217;</strong> Bars 99 &#8211; 120</p>



<p>This reprise is a shortened version of Part B, where the motif is repeated at first, but then the tambourine joins the snare in a new pattern to gain force in this last attack. In the end, they defeat the angels.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 99-103 are the repetition of the 32-35 bars.</li><li>Bars 104-116 we can hear the last attack, the tambourine joins the snare and the cymbal joins the bass drum. All instruments grow in presence.</li><li>Bars 117-120 are a passage to the closing. The claves enter to make a celebratory dance, very childish and naive, but very simple. Only later I noticed it sounds like the intro of Rage Against The Machine&#8217;s Killing In The Name.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Part C&#8217;</strong> Bars 121 &#8211; 136</p>



<p>The dance ends as it started, but is slower. Since the demons won, they don&#8217;t need to make all the rush they did at the beginning, but can make a slow and confident victory dance. Ending with the same motif from the beginning makes a full circle, meaning that like the demons in your head, they always come and go, and this is not an isolated battle.</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>Bars 121-128 are the repetition of bars 3-10, with the little addition of bass drum to add more base sound, because of the slower tempo.</li><li>Bars 129-130 the repetition continues but with the increase of the cymbal and snare.</li><li>Bars 131-136 the cymbal has a little motif of 5 consecutive strokes with all the other instruments increasing in strokes until the end.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The goal of this final project, which comes before the first assignment, is to create a plan for the assignment composition, which should last between 2 and 3 minutes and begin with the specified composition.</p>



<p>One thing I noticed is that it is suggested that the plan begins with the structure before deciding on the content. However, when I look at Assignment 1, I find that it begins with a group of demons entering the scene. As a result, I&#8217;m reluctant to separate the idea from the structure. So I decided to start with the idea/story and then go on to the structure.</p>



<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>



<p>When I first read &#8220;Curtain Rises, enter a group of demons&#8221; at the start of assignment 1, I immediately thought of the devils that pop into your head from time to time. Particularly when you&#8217;re going to do something that makes you feel uneasy. For example, for me, it was when I began writing music in notation, which I had never done before. All of your demons begin to rush through your head in the form of doubts such as &#8220;will I be able to do this?&#8221; and &#8220;why did I even start this course?&#8221;</p>



<p>For this piece, I decided to explore the battle between spirits (doubts, anxieties, self-censorship) and demons (confidence, tranquillity, wisdom) that happen inside your head when you&#8217;re about to do something uncomfortable.</p>



<h2 id="the-structure">The Structure</h2>



<p>Starting with the given Wild Dance composition, I opted to utilize the specified tempo (153 bpm) as the demons tempo since it conveys a sense of haste and chaos. By contrast, the angels will move at a slower pace, conveying a sense of tranquillity. </p>



<p>As I previously stated, my composition will be about a clash&nbsp;in which demons arrive and attack, angels defend, demons counter-attack and the angels ultimately triumph. I want the audience to sense this conflict, which will be reflected in the speed and instrument shifts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular cnvs-block-core-table-1628498574118"><table><thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Section</th><th>Duration / Tempo</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A &#8211; A horde of demons appear on stage, dancing around the angels and provoking them. The angels are standing calmly nearby.</td><td>Principal</td><td>~30 seconds at 153 bpm </td></tr><tr><td>B &#8211; The demons strike with hesitation, insecurity, and anxiety.</td><td>Principal</td><td>~40 seconds at 153 bpm</td></tr><tr><td>C- The angels continue to live in peace. They are composed, self-assured, and wise. They don&#8217;t desire war, so they demonstrate this by dancing slowly and peacefully.</td><td>Subsidiary</td><td>~40 seconds at 85 bpm</td></tr><tr><td>B&#8217;-The demons retaliate, but they&#8217;re growing nervous.</td><td>Reprise</td><td>~20 seconds at 153 bpm</td></tr><tr><td>C&#8217;-The angels grow in strength and distance themselves from the demons.</td><td>Closing</td><td>~20 seconds at 153 bpm</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="the-motifs">The motifs</h2>



<p>I developed some themes for each section. The first one will serve as an introduction and the example is already delivered, which heavily uses the tambourine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39.png" alt="" class="wp-image-188" width="270" height="336" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39.png 500w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39-241x300.png 241w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.02.39-300x373.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /></figure>



<p>In the B section, I imagined the demons&#8217; strike to be powerful, but with a slight hesitation at the end.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31.png" alt="" class="wp-image-189" width="277" height="346" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31.png 508w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31-240x300.png 240w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.00.31-300x374.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></figure>



<p>The angels in the C portion are calm, assertive, and peaceful. It will contrast with the prior two motifs&#8217; warlike snare.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45.png" alt="" class="wp-image-190" width="281" height="323" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45.png 514w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45-261x300.png 261w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-10-at-15.01.45-300x344.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /></figure>



<h2 id="the-instruments">The instruments</h2>



<p>For the demons parts, I chose the given instruments (Bass Drum, Snare Drum, Tambourine, Cymbal) because I believe they convey the sense of urgency and aggression I want to portray. In addition to the Bass Drum, a rhythmic instrument, the angels will also use the Bongos, Cabasa, and Finger Cymbals.</p>



<p>For simplicity, I retained four instruments for each part, and since I want it to be played by four musicians, they only have to switch between two instruments.</p>

<p>The backstory surrounding the Toccata is fascinating. Carlos Chávez was commissioned by John Cage to create a piece for the percussion ensemble with which he was travelling. As a result, the <meta charset="utf-8">Toccata for Percussion was created. The sad part is that <meta charset="utf-8">Cage&#8217;s ensemble was unable to execute the opening movement, which requires all members to play long, continuous drum rolls, and the piece was never played. The Toccata was not performed until 1948 (Hall, 2008).</p>



<p>The moral of this story, in my opinion, is that there is a fine line between what the composer wants and what the players are capable of playing. In my compositions, I&#8217;ll try to keep this in mind.</p>



<p>This is a three-movement work composed entirely of percussion instruments, the majority of which are unpitched (or indefinite-pitched). I was expecting Latin percussion instruments, but, with the exception of the Indian Drum, all of the other instruments are standard orchestral instruments, not exotic ones.</p>



<p>After a first listen, I discovered that Chávez divided the piece into Membranes and Metalic instruments, with a few wooden instruments thrown in the mix. The wooden instruments, I believe, are used for melody and the other for rhythm.</p>



<p>In terms of the first movement, I found it to be highly interactive. Instruments can be heard playing the passing theme at different times. Other times, as in the example below, the sound shifts from low to high pitch.</p>

<p>This first movement is characterized by the eight notes, that create some of the motifs of this part.</p>



<p>When I got to the end of this movement, I realized it ended the same way it started: with a roll. Actually, rolls are present in all music and may be the Toccata&#8217;s most prominent feature. When I got to the end of the movement, I realized it ended with a roll, just like it had begun.  Because Chávez wrote these final rolls without diminuendo, I believe it will be difficult for players to keep the roll while changing the strength of strokes at the same time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="469" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-1024x469.png" alt="" class="wp-image-220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-1024x469.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-300x138.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-768x352.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-1536x704.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-2048x939.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-640x293.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19-960x440.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.17.19.png 2452w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>With the exception of the xylophone, the instruments in the second movement are all metallic. This movement seemed more mysterious to me, perhaps because of the sound of the metallic instruments and the slower tempo. But, thanks to the xylophone and glockenspiel, it&#8217;s also the most melodic of the movements. I found it particularly fascinating when all of the instruments imitated one another, resulting in a unique timbre.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-991x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-219" width="423" height="437" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-991x1024.png 991w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-290x300.png 290w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-768x794.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-300x310.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-640x661.png 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25-960x992.png 960w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-15-at-12.12.25.png 1318w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /></figure>



<p>The third movement is more complex, and I finally found the Latin rhythms I was looking for at the beginning. We return to membrane instruments in this movement, with the glockenspiel, maracas, and claves added later. This movement appears to use more sixteenth notes than the previous ones, making it feel faster. The third movement continues to be interactive, with some instruments passing the motif from one instrument to the next, like the example below.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I found the Toccata for Percussion to be a fascinating composition in which I was able to acquire a feel of how different percussion instruments may be used to convey both rhythm and melody.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This project&#8217;s goal is to create two studies using at least three untuned percussion instruments. Despite the fact that I could have used some of the examples provided as a starting point for my work, I chose to build them from scratch.</p>



<p>While I thought using more instruments would be easier, the variety of instruments available and the techniques for each instrument were overwhelming. I often worked on a single instrument and then realized it didn&#8217;t fit well with the others, forcing me to rewrite it. That took longer than I anticipated.</p>



<p>A characteristic that I noticed about some of the percussion compositions I listened to is that they are coupled with dance or body movements. Therefore, the central focus of both of my studies is on expressive dance and bodily movement.</p>



<h2 id="study-1">Study 1</h2>



<p>My professional background is in advertising, and as I started thinking about this first research, I remembered an old Lacoste commercial called The Leap. This video shows a couple sitting at a coffee table, with the boy preparing to kiss the girl for the first time. The film then turns to a metaphor for what&#8217;s going on inside his head: a massive leap into the unknown. I immediately thought of my <a href="https://pedrovintem.000webhostapp.com/2021/07/project-1-percussion-solos" target="_blank">first study of Taiko</a> and how it is linked to breathing rhythm. Due to this, I chose the video and the Taiko as the basis for my initial study.</p>



<p>I decided Taiko was the foundation of this composition, the heart, and then I added instruments that I thought might be able to bring the breath rhythm to life. Wood Blocks first function as an echo of the heart (Taiko) and then as the rush of the mind. The snare brings a marching strength that reminds me of running. The tam-tam is used as a reminder of the character&#8217;s great action&#8217;s danger. Cabasas are merely used to cause confusion and dizziness.</p>



<p>When I was looking for information on instrument techniques, I came upon <a href="https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/instruments/percussion/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/instruments/percussion/" target="_blank">Philharmonia&#8217;s excellent webpage</a> on percussion instruments. There, I examined the tam-tam and one unique technique in which the musician rubs a triangular stick against the tam-tam&#8217;s edge&nbsp;to produce a harsh sound. If the player rubbed it gently enough, it could simulate the sound of the wind.</p>



<p>There are three parts to this piece:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The acceleration of breathing</li><li>The suspension of jumping</li><li>The unpredictability of the first kiss</li></ul>



<p>As much as possible, I tried to make it concise and interesting while staying true to the main idea. My 3rd section used a time change from 5/4 to 3/4 in order to help create some confusion. The ending was inspired by my first <a href="https://pedrovintem.000webhostapp.com/2021/06/listening-to-arthur-honegger-cello-sonata-h-20-iii-presto" target="_blank">listening of Honegger</a>, with the ending feeling incomplete (just like every first kiss, you want more from the moment) in a 4/4 bar rather than a 5/4 bar.</p>

<h2 id="study-2">Study 2</h2>



<p>This study was inspired by flamenco dances I watched as a kid. There were times when a male and female dancer alternated. The idea behind this song is to create a classic storyline in which a girl meets a boy and in the end, they dance together.</p>



<p>I have divided this piece into three parts:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The girl is introduced</li><li>The boy is introduced</li><li>They both dance together</li></ul>



<p>I attempted to use some Latin instruments, but because some of them were unfamiliar to me, I had to do some additional research into their techniques.</p>



<p>The Cajon and Tambourine offer the rhythm&#8217;s foundation. I looked at Vic Firth&#8217;s tutorials for the tambourine, particularly the usage of the thumb roll as a gentle and long roll that could fit this rhythm. Because I couldn&#8217;t find a standardized method to notate the Cajon, I created a two-line stave with the low strokes on the bottom line and the high strokes on the top line.</p>



<p>The girl is represented by the Castanets and the Guiro. For me, the Guiro was a whole new instrument. After seeing and listening to Guiro rhythms, I decided to keep it basic and only provide some context for the Castanets.</p>



<p>Bongos and Claves symbolize the boy. Cajon&#8217;s low pitch led me to choose Bongos instead of Congas since they are higher pitched. It is written in two-line Bongo notation.</p>

		<span>Variations, rhythm and all that jazz.</span>

</h2>



<p>I listened to all 16 variations from Boris Blacher&#8217;s Variations On A Paganini Theme, but I was curious how it sounded and looked in a concert, so I watched a performance by the Frankfurt Radio Symphony.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>The Paganini Caprice theme fades away after a few seconds, and Blacher&#8217;s variants come to life on their own. There&#8217;s a little resemblance to it now and then, but it&#8217;s really subtle. Another thing I noticed is that Blacher strives to showcase all instruments through the variations, starting with strings, then on to woodwinds, and finally to brass. Percussion continues to come and go as the variants change. Despite the fact that I believe most of the variants to be quite vibrant rhythmically, there is no variation dedicated only to percussion.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a score, and despite the fact that different time signatures were used between variations, I couldn&#8217;t figure out if Variable Metre was used at all.</p>



<p>For me, the second&nbsp;and last two&nbsp;variations were the most intriguing. The second variation features a bluesy oboe with blue notes, which I adore (and it looks like the player from the performance I posted does too). The 15th and 16th have a jazzier flavour to them, and they remind me of big bands. That was a fantastic conclusion. &#8220;Dominant rhythm and abrupt ends are Blacher hallmarks,&#8221; (Simon, 2003) I realized after learning more about Blacher.</p>



<p>All of this jazz influence, and how he changed it into an orchestral sound, piqued my curiosity in Blacher, and I&#8217;m likely to listen to him more in the future, and perhaps include some of his influences into my works.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Side Note about Variations. I had no clue what variations were, let alone how popular Paganini&#8217;s theme was. Basically, variation form is when you take a song&#8217;s theme and investigate, mine, twist, and transform it into a new piece of art (Hough, 2013). It appears to me to be a creative exercise rather than the construction of completely new work. I enjoy the idea of variations, and I&#8217;m curious as to why there aren&#8217;t any big musicians that do variations of other artists&#8217; songs. This reminds me that some DJs are experimenting with several versions of the same song like Stereossauro did with Carlos Paredes&#8217; Verdes Anos.</p>
