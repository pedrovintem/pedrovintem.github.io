<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Programme Note<br></strong></h2>



<p><em>The Tide Rises, The Tide Falls</em> is a choral work based on Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s poem, which reflects the cycles of nature and the fleeting nature of human life. The music mirrors the waves’ constant rhythm, especially in the recurring phrase “the tide rises, the tide falls,” with repeating musical patterns symbolising the unending movement of the sea.</p>



<p>Silence plays a key role in the composition, representing the brief pauses between waves as they retreat and flow. These moments of stillness emphasise the continuity of the tide and the inevitable passage of time. While the story follows the traveller hurrying toward town, the sea emerges as the central character. This is highlighted dramatically when the sea is called twice in the text, with heightened intensity in the music to reflect its power and permanence.</p>



<p>As the piece progresses, the focus shifts to the final realisation: the traveller never returns, yet the waves continue their eternal rhythm. Through its structure and dynamic contrasts, the piece invites listeners to reflect on the relationship between permanence and impermanence in the passage of time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reflection<br></strong></h2>



<p>Composing for an SATB choir, especially for <em>The Tide Rises, The Tide Falls,</em> was both a challenge and a rewarding experience. One important thing I learned was how crucial it is to think about singers’ breathing. I had to make sure the phrases weren’t too long and that the breaths matched the punctuation in the poem. This made the music feel more natural and easier to sing.</p>



<p>The text of the poem was the main inspiration for my work. Longfellow’s themes of cycles, change, and nature influenced the way I approached the music. The repeated phrase “the tide rises, the tide falls” became a recurring musical idea, showing the constant motion of the waves. Most of the music is written in homophony, to create a smooth and flowing sound, like the waves.</p>



<p>The story of the traveller added drama to the music. At first, the music reflects the steady rhythm of the tide. Later, it becomes more intense when it’s clear the traveller won’t return, emphasising the difference between the endless movement of the sea and the shortness of human life.</p>



<p>I worked carefully to build the piece step by step. I started with the chords, making sure the notes were divided correctly between the voices and that they followed the voice leading. Then, I added passing notes where they fit with the text and the mood of the poem.</p>



<p>Even though this process took time, I’m happy with how the piece turned out. I think it captures the mood and meaning of the poem well. I would love to hear it performed live, as a real choir would bring out the depth and emotion of the music.</p>
