<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Programme Note<br></strong></h2>



<p><em>The Tide Rises, The Tide Falls</em> is a choral work based on Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s poem, which reflects the cycles of nature and the fleeting nature of human life. The music mirrors the waves’ constant rhythm, especially in the recurring phrase “the tide rises, the tide falls,” with repeating musical patterns symbolising the unending movement of the sea.</p>



<p>Silence plays a key role in the composition, representing the brief pauses between waves as they retreat and flow. These moments of stillness emphasise the continuity of the tide and the inevitable passage of time. While the story follows the traveller hurrying toward town, the sea emerges as the central character. This is highlighted dramatically when the sea is called twice in the text, with heightened intensity in the music to reflect its power and permanence.</p>



<p>As the piece progresses, the focus shifts to the final realisation: the traveller never returns, yet the waves continue their eternal rhythm. Through its structure and dynamic contrasts, the piece invites listeners to reflect on the relationship between permanence and impermanence in the passage of time.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reflection<br></strong></h2>



<p>Composing for an SATB choir, especially for <em>The Tide Rises, The Tide Falls,</em> was both a challenge and a rewarding experience. One important thing I learned was how crucial it is to think about singers’ breathing. I had to make sure the phrases weren’t too long and that the breaths matched the punctuation in the poem. This made the music feel more natural and easier to sing.</p>



<p>The text of the poem was the main inspiration for my work. Longfellow’s themes of cycles, change, and nature influenced the way I approached the music. The repeated phrase “the tide rises, the tide falls” became a recurring musical idea, showing the constant motion of the waves. Most of the music is written in homophony, to create a smooth and flowing sound, like the waves.</p>



<p>The story of the traveller added drama to the music. At first, the music reflects the steady rhythm of the tide. Later, it becomes more intense when it’s clear the traveller won’t return, emphasising the difference between the endless movement of the sea and the shortness of human life.</p>



<p>I worked carefully to build the piece step by step. I started with the chords, making sure the notes were divided correctly between the voices and that they followed the voice leading. Then, I added passing notes where they fit with the text and the mood of the poem.</p>



<p>Even though this process took time, I’m happy with how the piece turned out. I think it captures the mood and meaning of the poem well. I would love to hear it performed live, as a real choir would bring out the depth and emotion of the music.</p>

<p>This song opens with something unexpected &#8211; a brief acappella introduction where the chorus sings &#8220;uh&#8217;s&#8221; intercalated by Orbison&#8217;s vocals. This opening creates an interesting contrast with what follows, although the chorus keeps the &#8220;uh&#8217;s&#8221; throughout the song.</p>



<p>The song&#8217;s most noticeable feature is its strong, steady beat. It uses a rockabilly shuffle rhythm that keeps pushing forward without letting up. This driving rhythm does more than just keep time &#8211; it actually helps tell the story of the song by matching the feeling of working non-stop, just like the lyrics describe.</p>



<p>I enjoyed particularly the rhythm section that keeps a steady beat while guitars add short, decorative fills between the vocal lines. The song uses simple chord changes that were common in early rock and roll. While these chord progressions aren&#8217;t complicated, they work perfectly for this song. They provide a solid foundation that lets listeners focus on the rhythm and Orbison&#8217;s voice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Thomas Tallis’s &#8220;If Ye Love Me&#8221;</strong> is a largely homophonic piece that conveys a smooth, contemplative, and peaceful mood. The voice leading is notably strong, with each part moving fluidly without large leaps—except for occasional moments in the bass, which add subtle grounding. The vocal ranges are narrow, helping maintain the calm atmosphere. Dynamics are used minimally, giving the piece a consistent, serene tone that emphasizes the message of the text.</p>



<p><strong>W.A. Mozart’s &#8220;Ave Verum Corpus&#8221;</strong> introduces a bit more tension through dissonances at the beginning, distinguishing it from the pure harmony in Tallis’s work. Although primarily homophonic, Mozart allows the voices slightly more freedom, especially in melismatic passages, which brings an emotional richness to the piece. The dynamics, introduced at crucial moments, lend drama and depth, reinforcing the solemn reverence of the text and creating a powerful listening experience.</p>



<p><strong>Clara Schumann’s &#8220;Abendfeier in Venedig&#8221;</strong> uses dynamics to create high and low points in the music, breaking away from a homogenous sound. It’s more homophonic than Mozart’s piece, with fewer dissonances, resulting in a calm and harmonious tone. Smooth voice leading, with no major leaps, keeps the mood gentle and reflective. Schumann’s approach to dynamics here gives the piece a flowing quality, guiding the listener through waves of subtle emotion.</p>



<p><strong>Edward Elgar’s &#8220;Owls&#8221;</strong> takes a distinct approach, employing a question-and-answer texture that enhances the conversational tone. The word painting is evident, as in the word &#8220;fall,&#8221; where the music mirrors the meaning of the text. The absence of melismas contributes to a more straightforward, spoken quality, which, combined with frequent pauses, creates an air of mystery. This approach draws the listener into the contemplative, somewhat eerie atmosphere Elgar crafts.</p>



<p><strong>Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s &#8220;Summer is Gone&#8221;</strong> is marked by extreme dissonance, aligning with the theme of seasonal change and the melancholy of summer’s end. While the texture remains primarily homophonic, there are flourishes in the soprano part that add expressiveness. The use of melismas complements the piece&#8217;s reflective tone, enhancing the sense of nostalgia. This combination of dissonance, homophony, and occasional embellishments creates a poignant representation of the season&#8217;s passing.</p>



<p><strong>Morten Lauridsen’s &#8220;O Magnum Mysterium&#8221;</strong> is predominantly homophonic, with a limited range for most voices except the soprano, which features notable leaps that embellish the melody. The melismas here are subtle yet significant, adding depth and reverence to the music. Lauridsen also employs divisi in the alto and bass parts, enriching the harmonic texture and adding a layer of complexity that elevates the spiritual nature of the piece.</p>



<p><strong>James Macmillan’s &#8220;O Radiant Dawn&#8221;</strong> is highly homophonic, with all voices moving together in a unified manner. The standout moment comes in the word &#8220;come,&#8221; where the dynamics build progressively, creating a sense of anticipation and proximity. The narrow melodic lines place the focus on dynamic shifts rather than complex melodic expressivity, resulting in a straightforward yet powerful piece. This use of dynamics brings depth to Macmillan&#8217;s minimalistic, chant-like approach, aligning with the theme of yearning.</p>



<p><strong>Cheryl Frances-Hoad’s &#8220;There is No Rose&#8221;</strong> offers an unusual take on the traditional Christmas carol. It begins simply with homophonic textures, but soon shifts to exotic harmonies that add an element of surprise and mystery. This harmonic shift breaks from the traditional carol sound, bringing an unexpected, almost sacred quality to the music. The juxtaposition of simplicity and complexity gives the piece a layered, dynamic character.</p>



<p><strong>Arvo Pärt’s &#8220;Magnificat&#8221;</strong> is highly contemplative, achieved through homophony, gentle melismas, and a narrow vocal range. The dynamics remain mostly soft, reinforcing the meditative atmosphere, though occasional fortes bring a heightened intensity to specific moments. This delicate balance between restraint and emphasis contributes to a serene, reverent tone that is characteristic of Pärt’s minimalist style. The dynamics help sustain interest and guide the listener through the piece’s quiet depths.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Clapping</strong></h4>



<p>Clapping involves striking the palms of the hands together to produce a sharp, percussive sound. The volume and resonance can be adjusted by varying the hand position or the force used. The sound is rhythmic and sharp, often used to create a sense of unity or pulse in a piece. Clapping is typically notated with an “X” on the staff .</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Overtone Singing</strong></h4>



<p>Overtone singing is produced by creating two or more pitches simultaneously using different parts of the vocal tract. The sound is unique and resonant creating droning effect with overtones that seem to shimmer above the fundamental. It can be notated specifying the overtone and fundamental on a separate staff line.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Whispered Singing</strong></h4>



<p>Whispered singing involves singing pitches with minimal vocal fold vibration, creating a breathy, almost ghostly sound. Unlike standard singing, whispered singing uses more air and less vocal tone, creating a soft, airy quality. It may be notated with specific text instructions, written as “whispered singing” above the vocal line.</p>

</div></figure>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vocoder</strong></h4>



<p>A vocoder digitally alters the voice by combining vocal input with synthesised sound. The singer’s vocal pitch and inflection control the synthesised output, producing an electronic voice effect. The resulting sound is robotic. The use of a vocoder can be marked in the score with an instruction, specifying sections where the digital effect should be applied. I believe a reference to the type of sound effect or synth may also be included.</p>

</div></figure>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stamping</strong></h4>



<p>Stamping involves forcefully pressing one’s foot onto the ground, creating a deep, rhythmic sound. It generates a thudding, resonant sound that can add primal energy and a grounding quality to a piece. It can be notated with an “X” accompanied by rhythmic notation.</p>

<p>The first thing that caught my ear was the powerful bass line. Unlike most songs where the bass stays in the background, here it&#8217;s front and centre, thanks to some cool effects that make it sound bigger and more interesting. The way the bass is used here completely changes how the song feels – it&#8217;s not just keeping the rhythm but actually leading the melody.</p>



<p>Overall the song has a sad, moody feeling that matches perfectly with the song&#8217;s theme about heartbreak. When the bridge (middle section) comes in, the chords take some surprising turns that keep things interesting and unexpected.</p>



<p>Another thing I liked was how the song sounds both old and new at the same time. It has the warm, rich sound you might hear in funk records from the 1970s, but it&#8217;s mixed in a modern way that makes everything clear and punchy. The drums hit hard like in hip-hop tracks, while still fitting naturally with the other instruments.</p>

<p>I was pleasently surprise by listeinng to this piece. The way Shaw uses silence is particularly interesting &#8211; instead of just being empty space, these quiet moments build excitement and add meaning to the music.</p>



<p>The piece starts simply. From there, it grows more complex as the voices weave together in interesting ways. Sometimes all the voices are homophonic, and other times they move into polyphonic lines. The overall sound ranges from a full chorus singing together to just whispers, showing how versatile a choir can be.</p>



<p>I believe she does something interesting with the words in this piece. Sometimes she lets us hear them clearly so we understand their meaning. Other times, she breaks them apart into pure sounds, like using the voice as an instrument. This creates an interesting back-and-forth between understanding the words and just experiencing the sounds.</p>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s a recent piece (2017), it reminds me of chant music. One can hear this connection in several ways:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The slow, thoughtful pace</li>



<li>The melismas</li>



<li>How the group recites text together</li>



<li>The peaceful, meditative feeling it creates</li>
</ul>

<p>I remember, I remember,<br>The house where I was born,<br>The little window where the sun<br>Came peeping in at morn;<br>He never came a wink too soon,<br>Nor brought too long a day,<br>But now, I often wish the night<br>Had borne my breath away!<br><br>I remember, I remember,<br>The roses, red and white,<br>The vi’lets, and the lily-cups,<br>Those flowers made of light!<br>The lilacs where the robin built,<br>And where my brother set<br>The laburnum on his birthday, &#8211;<br>The tree is living yet!<br><br>I remember, I remember,<br>Where I was used to swing,<br>And thought the air must rush as fresh<br>To swallows on the wing;<br>My spirit flew in feathers then,<br>That is so heavy now,<br>And summer pools could hardly cool<br>The fever on my brow!<br><br>I remember, I remember,<br>The fir trees dark and high;<br>I used to think their slender tops<br>Were close against the sky:<br>It was a childish ignorance,<br>But now ‘tis little joy<br>To know I’m farther off from heav’n<br>Than when I was a boy&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reflection</h2>



<p>I chose Thomas Hood&#8217;s &#8220;I Remember, I Remember&#8221; because of how musical it already seemed, especially with the repetition of &#8220;I remember&#8221; which made me hear a melody right away. The poem talks about nostalgia and losing childhood innocence, with each verse moving between hope and sadness. This back-and-forth gave me clear ideas for the music.</p>



<p>I started by figuring out the rhythm. The poem&#8217;s regular meter naturally lent itself to a 4/4 time signature. An early decision was to omit one stanza to keep the song to three minutes, but this actually helped make the piece more focused.</p>



<p>The melody came pretty naturally from the words, guided by the text&#8217;s natural rhythm and emotional content. I created the &#8220;I remember&#8221; descending motif to convey the hope-despair dichotomy present in the poem. Each stanza&#8217;s second half has a rising melodic line followed by a gradual descent, mirroring the poem&#8217;s emotional arc.</p>



<p>The hardest part was writing interesting piano music to go with the voice. Finding the right chords was easy enough, but making the piano part interesting was challenging. Given the text-heavy nature of the poem and the dominance of the melody, I kept the piano part simple, only adding more during the parts where the voice was silent.</p>



<p>In the harmony, I used diminished chords on D and F to add drama to the music. This helped bring out the emotional side of the poem. The way the melody goes up and then down in each verse really helped show the contrast between hope and sadness in the poem.</p>



<p>While I am particularly happy with the vocal melody, I acknowledge that the piano accompaniment remains somewhat conventional and could benefit from further development. Nonetheless, this assignment has helolped me understand the difficulty in text setting and the challenges in creating a unified piece from an existing poem. </p>
