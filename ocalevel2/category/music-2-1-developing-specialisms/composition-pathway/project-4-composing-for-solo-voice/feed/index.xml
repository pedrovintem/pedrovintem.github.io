<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chosen Poem</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">I Remember, I Remember (1826) by Thomas Hood</h3>



<p>I remember, I remember,<br>The house where I was born,<br>The little window where the sun<br>Came peeping in at morn;<br>He never came a wink too soon,<br>Nor brought too long a day,<br>But now, I often wish the night<br>Had borne my breath away!<br><br>I remember, I remember,<br>The roses, red and white,<br>The vi’lets, and the lily-cups,<br>Those flowers made of light!<br>The lilacs where the robin built,<br>And where my brother set<br>The laburnum on his birthday, &#8211;<br>The tree is living yet!<br><br>I remember, I remember,<br>Where I was used to swing,<br>And thought the air must rush as fresh<br>To swallows on the wing;<br>My spirit flew in feathers then,<br>That is so heavy now,<br>And summer pools could hardly cool<br>The fever on my brow!<br><br>I remember, I remember,<br>The fir trees dark and high;<br>I used to think their slender tops<br>Were close against the sky:<br>It was a childish ignorance,<br>But now ‘tis little joy<br>To know I’m farther off from heav’n<br>Than when I was a boy&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reflection</h2>



<p>I chose Thomas Hood&#8217;s &#8220;I Remember, I Remember&#8221; because of how musical it already seemed, especially with the repetition of &#8220;I remember&#8221; which made me hear a melody right away. The poem talks about nostalgia and losing childhood innocence, with each verse moving between hope and sadness. This back-and-forth gave me clear ideas for the music.</p>



<p>I started by figuring out the rhythm. The poem&#8217;s regular meter naturally lent itself to a 4/4 time signature. An early decision was to omit one stanza to keep the song to three minutes, but this actually helped make the piece more focused.</p>



<p>The melody came pretty naturally from the words, guided by the text&#8217;s natural rhythm and emotional content. I created the &#8220;I remember&#8221; descending motif to convey the hope-despair dichotomy present in the poem. Each stanza&#8217;s second half has a rising melodic line followed by a gradual descent, mirroring the poem&#8217;s emotional arc.</p>



<p>The hardest part was writing interesting piano music to go with the voice. Finding the right chords was easy enough, but making the piano part interesting was challenging. Given the text-heavy nature of the poem and the dominance of the melody, I kept the piano part simple, only adding more during the parts where the voice was silent.</p>



<p>In the harmony, I used diminished chords on D and F to add drama to the music. This helped bring out the emotional side of the poem. The way the melody goes up and then down in each verse really helped show the contrast between hope and sadness in the poem.</p>



<p>While I am particularly happy with the vocal melody, I acknowledge that the piano accompaniment remains somewhat conventional and could benefit from further development. Nonetheless, this assignment has helolped me understand the difficulty in text setting and the challenges in creating a unified piece from an existing poem. </p>

<p>As a listener familiar with Jamie Lidell&#8217;s work, this song is a surprising and intriguing departure from his usual style. </p>



<p>The song creates a dreamlike, ethereal atmosphere that seems to keep up to its title.  What I liked most about this piece is the connection between Lidell&#8217;s deep, resonant voice and the piano lines. The piano mirrors the vocal melody, creating an interesting contrast between the two timbres. The vocal performance is particularly noteworthy for its &#8220;dragging&#8221; quality &#8211; he extends and stretches the melodic phrases, lending a meditative, deeply sensitive character to the music. This technique enhances the contemplative nature of the piece and draws the listener into its hypnotic atmosphere.</p>



<p>While minimalistic in their application, the electronic elements play a crucial role in shaping the song&#8217;s character. They provide a foundation that deepens the overall sound, expanding beyond what would be possible with just piano and voice. These subtle electronic textures contribute significantly to the dreamlike quality of the piece, reinforcing the theme of transcendence suggested by the title. </p>

<p>The song immediately creates a satisfying emotional journey, building tension before resolving into the repeated phrase &#8220;all in good time.&#8221; This reminded me of Eibhlín a Rún listening I did previously. This structure creates a powerful sense of resolution that is both pleasing and emotionally fulfilling. The overall style evokes traditional folk music that I feel its meant to be sung in a group, repeating the &#8220;all in good time&#8221; part all together.</p>



<p>Another feature of the piece is the interplay between the male and female voices. Iron &amp; Wine and Fiona Apple&#8217;s vocal collaboration follows a traditional approach of conversation-style singing, where the two voices create an engaging contrast. This back-and-forth dynamic adds depth and interest to the song.</p>

<p>The piece immediately got my attention with its opening baritone saxophone line &#8211; a riff that is both catchy and bluesy. This memorable theme serves as more than just an introduction; it becomes the binding element that holds together the entire seven-minute composition. It was both accessible and easy to follow the piece.</p>



<p>What makes this song engaging is how the band uses this catchy opening theme throughout the piece. As the composition progresses, different instruments take their turns in the spotlight, but the original theme is never far away. The soloists occasionally offer hints or fragments of the main theme, creating a sense of anticipation in the listener. This technique of teasing the return of the main theme keeps the audience engaged throughout the extended duration of the piece.</p>



<p>I like how this creates a satisfying tension between the known (the theme) and the unknown (the improvisations).</p>

<p>I found this piece while working on the exercise about writing piano accompaniment for a folk song. I didn&#8217;t know the song, so I researched it on YouTube, where this performance by Dervish &amp; Friends stood out.</p>



<p>When I first heard the song, I was struck by its beautiful melody and minimalistic instrumentation. The way it&#8217;s arranged lets you really feel the emotion in the song, making it a powerful experience to listen to. The song is slow and careful, which adds to its sad mood. Each singer adds their own twist to the melody, making it even more emotional. </p>



<p>One thing that really stood out was how the singers ornamented the melody, which reminds me of Arabic and Indian singing traditions. The use of microtones in these embellishments adds expressiveness to the melody.</p>



<p>The song uses repetition in a clever way, especially with the phrase &#8220;Eibhlín a Rún.&#8221; This repeated line feels like a group of people calling out together. As the song goes on, more voices join in, making it feel stronger and more emotional. This builds a sense of togetherness that really adds to the song&#8217;s impact.</p>

<p>For &#8220;I wandered lonely as a cloud,&#8221; I focused on creating a sense of sadness and isolation. I used a downwards melody for &#8220;wandered&#8221; and a high, light tone for &#8220;cloud&#8221; to achieve this effect.</p>



<p>In &#8220;Because I could not stop for death&#8221; the word &#8220;stop&#8221; was particularly important, so I used a sudden pause to emphasise it, followed by a low, sustained note for &#8220;death&#8221; to convey its gravity.</p>



<p>&#8220;Busy old fool, unruly sun&#8221; is about energy and disorder. I employed rapid notes for &#8220;busy&#8221; and an irregular rhythm for &#8220;unruly&#8221; to musically illustrate these concepts.</p>



<p>Finally, for &#8220;I miss him in the weeping of the rain,&#8221; I aimed to convey a sense of melancholy. The word &#8220;weeping&#8221; was central to this, and I used a repeating pattern to mimic the fall of raindrops and tears.</p>

<p>In approaching this task, I first saw the natural stresses in the text. This helped me determine which syllables should fall on strong beats in each time signature. My main challenge was playing with musical rhythms that would be interesting and singable.</p>



<p>For each example, I aimed to create a distinct character:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The 3/4 version creates a sense of waves and tide of slow-fast movement.</li>



<li>The 4/4 version has a straightforward, but working against the natural feel of the text.</li>



<li>The 6/8 version has a more erratic feel, almost rolling quality.</li>
</ol>

<p>According to the Oxford Music Online&#8217;s artcile on voice, sound is produced when vocal folds are brought together and air flows through them. The crico-thyroid muscle stretches the folds to the correct length for pitch, while other muscles aid in adduction. The Bernoulli effect causes the folds to vibrate, creating sound.</p>



<p>In a not so technical wording, we have vocal folds that come together when we speak or sing. As we breathe out, air pushes through these folds, making them vibrate. A special muscle can stretch these flaps to change their length, which is how we make different pitches. The fast vibration of these flaps as air passes through is what creates the timbre of the voice. </p>



<p>There is a proper posture to project the voice: erect head, high chest, relaxed shoulders, tilted pelvis, and weight on the balls of the feet. This facilitates optimal breathing: a silent, deep breath causing lower rib expansion as the diaphragm descends.</p>
