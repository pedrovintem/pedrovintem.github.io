<p>For this assignment, I composed a piano piece titled &#8220;Putting Bernardo to Sleep,&#8221; inspired by a short theme I played while putting my son to sleep. The goal was to create a soothing and simple lullaby, with a soft and gentle melody.</p>



<p>The composition begins with a thin, but as the piece progresses, I experimented with thicker textures to add variety and depth. I also played with the range of the piano, starting with closely spaced notes and gradually expanding into the upper register. This choice was intentional, aiming to maintain a light and innocent feel, which I associate with the sound of higher pitches.</p>



<p>I incorporated octaves to enrich the sound and give the piece a fuller presence without overwhelming the intended softness. In the fourth section, I felt a modulation was needed to keep it interesting. To achieve this, I decided to descend chromatically by fifths.</p>



<p>While I am satisfied with the gentle, calming atmosphere the piece evokes, I can&#8217;t help but feel that it turned out somewhat predictable and similar to a simple pop piano music. While there&#8217;s nothing inherently wrong with this style, I had hoped to achieve a deeper, more classical sound. </p>
