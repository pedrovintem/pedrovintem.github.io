										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the traditional version, I prioritised close voice leading with minimal motion in individual lines to achieve smooth harmonic transitions. This approach ensured clarity and cohesion throughout, with each chord naturally leading to the next in a way that felt balanced.</p>



<p>For the experimental version, I intentionally broke the rules to create dramatic shifts and moments of contrast. For example, in the second version of progression #1, I introduced unexpected leaps, such as the leap in Violin 1 to emphasise the B chord, which was followed by a leap in Violin 2 and Viola on the next chord. Additionally, in the second version of progression #2, I opened the chord spacing, spreading the harmonies more widely to. These changes added a sense of unpredictability and heightened emotional intensity.</p>



<p>Comparing the two versions, the traditional version stands out for its clarity and cohesion. In contrast, the experimental version offers dramatic shifts. Pushing for drama in the experimental version was both challenging and rewarding. Challenging because it step away from my natural inclination toward smooth voice leading and embracing the freedom to break the rules. Rewarding because I feel the second version is more interesting and exciting than the first.</p>

<p>Even though this isn&#8217;t the type of music I usually listen to, I found myself really enjoying it. The song feels like a modern take on an older style, kind of like taking a vintage outfit and giving it a fresh, trendy update.<br></p>



<p>The song is packed with classic 80s sounds: synthesisers, distinctive drums, a soft electric guitar, and a bouncy bass line.</p>



<p>Carpenter&#8217;s voice stands out immediately &#8211; she sings in a very high pitch that instantly brings to mind Dolly Parton. The interplay between Carpenter&#8217;s high, strident vocal timbre and the lush synth background, contrasted against the robust bass and drum elements, creates a sonically engaging experience.</p>



<p>What makes this song really interesting is its harmonic suprises. The chromatic chords, F# Major and C# Major, show a level of musical complexity not often heard in mainstream pop. A particularly notable moment is the modulation to C Major, which adds an unexpected and refreshing harmonic twist.<br></p>



<p>Dynamicly, the song follows a typical pop music pattern &#8211; it starts soft and builds up during the chorus, maintaining a consistent energy throughout.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As a listener not typically drawn to Tom Waits&#8217; music but I found that this music feels like an improvisational moment &#8211; as if the recording were made spontaneously in an old bar. The performance feels very authentic and not overproduced.</p>



<p>The instrumentation is immediately interesting, centered around an old, out-of-tune piano that serves as the foundational element of the piece. This imperfect piano is complemented by a bass, trumpet.</p>



<p>Harmonically, the piece follows a relatively traditional i-iv-V-i progression, providing a familiar structural backbone. However, they introduce intrigue through the vocal melody, which occasionally explores higher vocal registers. This subtle musical tension adds depth to the seemingly straightforward harmonic structure.</p>



<p>The most compelling aspect of the performance lies in its dynamic and timbral qualities. Waits&#8217; vocal delivery is dramatically dynamic, shifting between different intensities and characters. These variations convey the persona of an unstable, potentially drunk performer, bringing a theatrical quality to the music. The timbre is equally surprising &#8211; the sharp, out-of-tune piano finds a perfect companion in Waits&#8217; rough, sometimes off-key voice. This is contrasted by the more straightforward bass and the melodic trumpet.<br><br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I really enjoyed this piece. It feels like a musical parade &#8211; marching, bold, and definitely festive. The extended final cadence is my favourite part. It&#8217;s almost like Shostakovich is having a bit of fun, stretching out the celebration just a little longer than you&#8217;d expect.</p>



<p>Right from the start, the music grabs the attention with a bold brass fanfare that sounds almost like a military celebration. The sound shifts constantly, with different instrument groups taking turns. At times, the delicate woodwinds cut through the heavy brass, creating interesting moments of contrast. When all the instruments play together, the sound becomes powerful and full.</p>



<p>In terms of timber the brass section maintains a strong, penetrating quality, while the woodwinds provide high, punctuating tones. The strings show versatility, moving from delicate passages when paired with woodwinds to powerful reinforcement when joining the full orchestral texture.</p>



<p>This piece doesn&#8217;t have a single, easy-to-follow melody. Instead, it&#8217;s filled with musical fragments &#8211; quick runs in the strings, bursts of sound from the brass, and rhythmic patterns that keep you listening. The harmony is pretty straightforward, but Shostakovich throws in a surprise at the end with an extended final section that almost feels like a musical joke, stretching out the ending for nearly two minutes.</p>



<p>The dynamic range of the piece is loud, with most sections performed above forte. This consistent high-energy approach reinforces the work&#8217;s festivity, with rare moments of piano dynamics.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Xenakis uses extended string techniques to create dramatic contrasts and rich, layered sounds. For example, chaotic glissandi produce a swirling sound, while sul ponticello adds a sharp, metallic tone. There&#8217;s a sense that he blends these techniques to guide the piece from order to chaos and back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the piano version, Mussorgsky uses abrupt dynamic contrasts to convey the grotesque, lurching character of the gnome. This contrasts and rapid chromatic lines create tension. Ravel‚Äôs orchestration addresses this by expanding the instrumentation and using the full range of the orchestra to heighten the drama and grotesque qualities of the gnome‚Äôs depiction.</p>



<p>He assigns the initial stumbly melody to the woodwinds, particularly the bassoon and clarinet, whose dark, reedy tones amplify the grotesque mood. But the softer melody is assigned to the flute and oboe. The strings, playing the glissando phrases, mimic the gnome‚Äôs jerky, irregular movements, while the brass and low percussion provide a lot of weight. This layering of timbres, impossible to achieve with a solo piano, creates a vivid and immersive soundscape.</p>



<p>Another transformation lies in doubling and layering lines across multiple instruments. Ravel distributes these lines among the orchestra, creating a dialogue between instruments that adds different textures and complexity. The addition of bass instruments like the tuba and contrabassoon gives the piece a more grounded, ominous foundation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Claude Vivier &#8211; Lonely Child </h2>



<p>Overall there&#8217;s haunting sound. The soprano blends with the clarinet, horns, and strings, while the Japanese brass Rin remains constant, adding a bell-like resonance. Percussion instruments like the gong and bass drum deliver sudden, shocking moments that increase the tension.</p>



<p>The texture shifts dramatically, with sudden transitions from sparse sounds to dense orchestration, sometimes followed by silence that provides a brief sense of relief. The soprano‚Äôs melody is doubled by the strings, horns and clarinet, while dissonant harmonies maintain tension without resolution. Techniques like glissandos and harmonics in the strings add an unstable quality to the sound.</p>

<p>The texture begins sparsely, with the bell and strings introducing the music, and gradually grows into a dense, layered sound as all the strings join. The strings play continuously until the end, with no silences or breaks.</p>
