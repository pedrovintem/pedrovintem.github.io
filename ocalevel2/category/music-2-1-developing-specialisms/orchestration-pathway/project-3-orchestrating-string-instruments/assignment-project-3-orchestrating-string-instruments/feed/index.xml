<p>After discussing with my tutor I decided to orchestrate Debussy’s Prelude from the Suite Bergamasque.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reflection:</h3>



<p><strong>How successful do you feel your arrangement is?<br></strong>I listened to different performances of the piece, but most closely to Maria João Pires’ performance of the piano version to understand the character of the piece and tried to remain faithful to that interpretation. For me, the biggest challenge was changing  the work of such an iconic composer and understanding how much liberty I could take in orchestrating it. With that in mind, I feel that I was able to successfully convey the same delicate and intimate character in the A sections while also exploring new expressive possibilities in the B section. The addition of glissandos was particularly rewarding because it brought a texture and technique to the B section that isn’t available on the piano, allowing the string orchestra to provide a unique voice while respecting the original work.</p>



<p><strong>How well do you think you used the instrumental resources available?<br></strong>I think I created a balance between maintaining Debussy’s original mood and adding richness through orchestration. For example, the first violins carried the main melody in the A sections to preserve the lightness and simplicity of the piano version, while the sparing use of the double bass supported the ethereal mood. The violins and violas pairing in the coda added drama and power without overwhelming the piece&#8217;s subtle beauty.</p>



<p><strong>How useful was the structural analysis in completing the arrangement?<br></strong>The structural analysis was helpful in guiding my decisions and ensuring that my arrangement remained cohesive. By identifying the ternary form and understanding the transitions between sections, I could plan how to vary the orchestration while maintaining the overall flow. For example, recognizing that the A sections required a delicate, transparent texture helped me decide to a sparing instrumentation, while the contrasting nature of the B section encouraged me to experiment with glissandos. The analysis also helped me build toward the climax in the coda, where I layered the orchestra more fully.</p>
